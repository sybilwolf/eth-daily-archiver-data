I agree with everything said within, especially with defi, DAI, lending options, and 8-20% returns. I believe I understand it all, how it works, and what the benefit it.\n\nThe issue I have is that at this point in the entire scenario, why would I think about DAI and 8-20% returns, when I (and I think most of us here) believe the ceiling for ETH is so much higher than that. If in 5 years, ETH has gone up to, and stabilized around where people think it might ($10k-$15k), then that's a different story. And maybe it doesn't go up from here, but every time I am told to use anything to buy a stable coin pegged to the dollar, it just doesn't make sense right now. I'd rather put it into something with more potential.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Possibly an ignorant question, but I watched the &quot;Why do we need DeFi on Ethereum when we already have Bitcoin?&quot; video posted a couple days ago.
