I bought ETH heavily in April / May and couldn't contain my excitement as the price exploded to $300.\n\n>Many of the people I spoke with at work thought I was crazy. I still remember the looks I got and what they said. \"You mean like Bitcoin, isn't that for criminals? You think this is the future of our business? And no one controls it? Sorry, this makes no sense.\" One Partner I work with at my firm actually made fun of me for it every chance he had over the next 3 months, in his own good-natured way.\n\n>They were curious, but thought it was a fad. A flash in the pan. An object of ridicule.\n\n>Guess what? They're not laughing anymore. Now, they're all asking me what this technology will really mean for our business...and if they they are too late to invest. I'm now the blockchain guru at work and helping to plot our strategy for how we will deliver blockchain solutions to our clients. \n\n>I bet some of you have similar stories. Don't ever let people make you feel like you are crazy because you understand what is coming next. What a difference 6 months can make.\n\nPerspective is a beautiful thing.
