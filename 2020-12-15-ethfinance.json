There are people able to sell their ETH to ETHE share in the past and up until Jan 4th, it's just the waiting period is 12 months. So if someone got ETHE 12/14/2019 they could have sold today on the secondary market.\n\nIt's a 90 day wait not 84 [(Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/i4mebl/daily_general_discussion_august_6_2020/g0k2tev/?context=3)). I mistakenly took the day of announcement as the start of the waiting period but it was really a week before that. That was my bad way back when I just had the news release to go off of and why it would of sounded like 84 days. (Apologies!) That said, its a 90 day wait for ***the 6 month waiting period to take effect.*** It's like a regulation type this... see below:\n\nYou can see the Jan 4th date in Grayscale's FAQ ([Here](https://grayscale.co/faq/)) *\"How will holders of the Product\u2019s private placement shares be affected upon the Form 10 for such Product becoming effective?\"*\n\n>**Holding Period Reduction**: The previous 12 month holding period under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) would be reduced to 6 months. The holding period reduction would become effective after the Product has been a reporting company for at least 90 days and has satisfied the other requirements under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.  \n>  \n>For example, if a Product\u2019s Form 10 goes effective on October 5, 2020, on January 4, 2021 (90 days later), any private placement investors of such Product who have held their shares for at least 6 months (regardless of when they invested) will be able to have the restrictive legend removed from their shares.  \n>  \n>For Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the holding period was reduced to 6 months as of April 20, 2020.\\*\\*\\*  \n>  \n>For Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the holding period will be reduced to 6 months as of January 4, 2021.\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt basically means this (if my math & logic are right) - any ETHE that was issued between 1/4/2020 to 7/4/2020 will be between 6 months to 12 months old. It would be previously held from secondary sale due to the old 12 month rule but now all at once on Jan 4th fall into the \"over 6 month category\".\n\nRight now there are about 5 Million ETHE available for sale on the secondary market ([Unrestricted Shares](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/ETHE/security)) . Between 12/31/2019 (year end report was last data point I had) and 7/6/2020 --- **12,905,300 ETHE** were issued. This will be 2.5x the current supply ***now able to be sold on the secondary market*** by accredited investors that previously wasn't due to the 12 month wait being reduced to 6 months. Again, ***POTENTIALLY -*** its up to each accredited investor. They can also hodl.\n\nIts...... a lot. And that is a group that might be motivated to arb the premium (I guess the arb play is a big reason this is growing so fast). We shall see, ***NO GUARANTEES*** it will drop. Or if it does drop, ***NO GUARANTEES*** the actual USD value falls if the premium goes down while ETH itself goes up. In fact (although circumstances were pretty different) GBTC actually saw a rise when they had gone through this same process!\n\nI am planning to trade this a certain way, but I am not going to tell people how to trade this.
