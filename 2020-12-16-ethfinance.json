I'm going to monetize my airline miles with OmiseGo and bill my employer though Request Network...\n\nThings are really a lot more simple now.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It was kind of a slow onset of reality over the first half of 2018.  Thankfully, I was tax-conscious enough to make sure I could cover my 2017 liabilities before we dropped into 3 digits. I remember thinking &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to sell $700 ETH in April to pay my taxes!&quot; And then it was $400 in April.  Wall street bonuses didn&#39;t help. Chinese New Year didn&#39;t help.  We were adrift on a sea of despair.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s hard to say what I will do differently this time around.  I would say that I will sell more aggressively once it&#39;s obvious the bottom is falling out.  But that previous cycle was based all on hype, I see much more organic growth behind this cycle.  There will be ups and downs, but I don&#39;t see the &quot;real value of ETH is 0&quot; crowd having as much of an effect this time around.   </p>\n\n<p>So really I see this market maturing and going up on a much more stable footing than the last time.  </p>\n\n<p>There was a lot of altcoin noise in 2017/18 as well.  At the peak in Jan 2018, I of course loved ETH, but had so many other irons in the fire.  I thought I was going to be quitting my job and living off my NEO GAS!  ETH was alright, but Raiblocks used a grid lattice for instant transfers!  IOTA is going to connect me to my refrigerator and thermostat!  Oyster Pearl will put everyone back in control of their private data.
