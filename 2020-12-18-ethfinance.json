I got into eth around 2015, I still hold about 30% of my assets in btc, and the rest i moved to eth in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>My point is, i love btc and eth. The eth community is no angel, and has lots of toxic/tribal maxis, which is disappointing. But it absolutely pales in comparison to the theological reverence bitcoiners have for bitcoin. </p>\n\n<p>With all that said, check this out. The cognitive dissonance, the projection, the complete lack of critical thinking. It&#39;s absolutely amazing to me. Not only is the general public mostly unaware of eth still, but many &quot;crypto&quot; people still don&#39;t get it either, or have made it their life&#39;s goal to not understand. For context - this guy is an <a href=\"/r/BitcoinMarkets\">/r/BitcoinMarkets</a> mod, commenting on ETH. \ud83d\ude16</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s a product without a market.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, eth is complex. It breaks in complex ways.</p>\n\n<p>Everything Eth can do Amazon does better... and cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not a store of value, wasn\u2019t built to be one, but it pretends to be and people treat it that way.</p>\n\n<p>Eth is a cult being led by a hack child prodigy who is insulated from the real world by his harem of neck beards and basement dwellers.</p>\n\n<p>Eth has no focus, purpose, or reason to exist aside from feeding the egos of people who have bought into their bull shit.</p>\n\n<p>Eth is worse than a shitcoin because it has graduated into being a cult religion.</p>\n\n<p>All respect to the fantastic engineering they sometimes pull off... but it isn\u2019t enough to just release code; It needs to exist for a reason outside of vanity.</p>\n\n<p>Lines of code != value</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have never seen anyone be this confused about anything. It&#39;s like he just repurposed a buttcoin post, and scratched out btc and wrote eth. Like.... You know these same comments are made about btc.... and you know they&#39;re entirely baseless. But.... You just repackage them for eth? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/kfdpmv/daily_discussion_friday_december_18_2020/gg9b3v6/\">https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/kfdpmv/daily_discussion_friday_december_18_2020/gg9b3v6/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-18 08:40:39","distinguished":null,"edited":"2020-12-18 12:11:46","id":"gg9kg4g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kffgjf","parent_id":"t3_kffgjf","score":36,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"I don't know why anyone tolerates this bizarre maxi rhetoric.
