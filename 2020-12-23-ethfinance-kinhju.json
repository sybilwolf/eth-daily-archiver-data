But Ethereum is the closest yet. Yes, there are other chains that &#39;scale&#39; well. But at the almost complete sacrifice of one other side of the trilemma, usually decentralization.  Its easy to scale when you control all the nodes and each node can 100% trust the data from the others.</p>\n\n<p>Whether the current proposed designs for scalability work well or not, i see no other chain closer to solving the trilemma than Ethereum. But then you read the comments on that video and its all &quot;lol, glad i dumped ETH, buying ADA and ATOM now.&quot; \ud83e\udd14</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-23 16:25:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ggumfla","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kinhju","parent_id":"t3_kinhju","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hblask","body":"You have to remember what these guys are selling: clicks.

The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee they\u2019ll accept. Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a fee, or slower if they don\u2019t. The fee the market would settle on should be minimal. If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with lower fees. It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions as it can.

The down side is that it\u2019s vulnerable at the beginning when it\u2019s small, although the value that could be stolen should always be smaller than the amount of effort required to steal it. If someone has other motives to prove a point, they\u2019ll just be proving a point I already concede.\n\n\n>My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it\u2019s locked in and we\u2019re stuck with it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that\u2019s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it\u2019ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there\u2019s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000. There\u2019s plenty of granularity if typical prices become small. For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it\u2019s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.\n\n\n>Ripple is interesting in that it\u2019s the only other system that does something with trust besides concentrate it into a central server.\n\n\n>Satoshi","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>With all this XRP hate (rightly so), it still is surprising to me that ripple is really old in the cryptocurrency space.

I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that\u2019s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it\u2019ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there\u2019s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000. There\u2019s plenty of granularity if typical prices become small. For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it\u2019s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.</p>\n\n<p>Ripple is interesting in that it\u2019s the only other system that does something with trust besides concentrate it into a central server.</p>\n\n<p>Satoshi</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-23 06:15:43","distinguished":null,"edited":"2020-12-23 06:21:26","id":"ggsqrzr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kinhju","parent_id":"t3_kinhju","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethrevolution","body":"To think, if the laws for hiring aliens were less strict in the USA, they (Ripple Inc) had hired a young Vitalik and Ethereum might have never seen the light of day!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To think, if the laws for hiring aliens were less strict in the USA, they (Ripple Inc) had hired a young Vitalik and Ethereum might have never seen the light of day!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-23 06:17:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ggsqxmn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kinhju","parent_id":"t1_ggsqrzr","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Revanchist1","body":"So many things have had to gone both right and wrong to get to where we are today.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So many things have had to gone both right and wrong to get to where we are today.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-23 06:28:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ggsrywu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kinhju","parent_id":"t1_ggsqxmn","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethrevolution","body":"yeah, it's ... special.
