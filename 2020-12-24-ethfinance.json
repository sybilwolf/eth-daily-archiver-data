If today GBTC is trading at a 30% premium, there is no way for Grayscale / an investor to pump out tons of GBTC to take advantage of the premium same day.

Its an effective long term play, but there is the risk reward there - if I dump 10,000 BTC in today will the premium exist 6 months from now?\n\nETF should change that even without a change to GBTC's structure (I'm thinking at least) because if an effective peg to BTC is achieved, why would you ever buy GBTC at a premium? People would be selling the 30% premium to then buy more BTC through the ETF. Creating a lot of sell pressure to drop the GBTC price. No one would want to buy GBTC because the BTC ETF is cheaper. Getting rid of any buy pressure. Then the market evens it out.\n\nI can't comment to in depth on your post as I don't know much about futures, but as you noted I don't know if many people have access to that type of trading. A lot of the secondary market holders are Joe Schmoes like me just trying to get some exposure in a retirement account. Especially with GBTC. Since ETHE seems to be a premium play at the moment. So it's the traditional Buy/Sell market. I don't even think I have access to short if I wanted to.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think part of the problem will always be the 6 month wait. If today GBTC is trading at a 30% premium, there is no way for Grayscale / an investor to pump out tons of GBTC to take advantage of the premium same day. And the trickle of supply simply is not elastic enough to keep up with spikes in demand. Its an effective long term play, but there is the risk reward there - if I dump 10,000 BTC in today will the premium exist 6 months from now?</p>\n\n<p>ETF should change that even without a change to GBTC&#39;s structure (I&#39;m thinking at least) because if an effective peg to BTC is achieved, why would you ever buy GBTC at a premium? People would be selling the 30% premium to then buy more BTC through the ETF. Creating a lot of sell pressure to drop the GBTC price. No one would want to buy GBTC because the BTC ETF is cheaper. Getting rid of any buy pressure. Then the market evens it out.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t comment to in depth on your post as I don&#39;t know much about futures, but as you noted I don&#39;t know if many people have access to that type of trading.
