To start with here's the yearly volume broken down by month and the implied adoption velocity of Kyber this year.\n\nMonth|2019 Monthly Volume|2020 Monthly Volume|YOY Growth %\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nJan|5|67|1340%\nFeb|12|139|1158%\nMar|18|196|1088%\nApr|24|93|387%\nMay|38|103|271%\nJun|56|155|276%\nAug|29|397|1368%\nSep|28|369|1317%\nOct|34|185|544%\nNov|51|316|620%\nDec|41|383|934%\nTotal|395|2678|678%\n\nNumbers are in millions. Clearly it's been a good year. When I was DCAing this last year the volume was showing this amazing 30% month on month adoption velocity as the price went from about $.24 down to about $.15 at the lowest.\n\nIf you would have been happy to buy KNC in hindsight at $.15, it has shown about 678% adoption growth this year which would give it an equivalent price of about $1 to be at the same point of the adoption curve. It's currently at... $.80... so that may be interesting to you.\n\nThe reason it isn't just an apples to apples comparison though is the tokenomics changed mid year. So, here's the new tokenomics and their current values:\n\nNetwork fee 0.1%. Burn 6.2%. Reward 67.32%. Rebate 26.48%. Basically Katalyst and subsequent votes have reduced the network fee substantially and reduced the rewards to KNC holders by 26.48% which goes to market makers instead. If we just adjust the $1 estimate above that gives us an equivalent price of $.74 which is where it bottomed very recently.\n\nSo what's the PE currently? Well assuming that the volume maintains its average of the last 6 months of 320M for the next year that would give us a projected annual volume of 3.8B.\n\nCurrent KNC staking percent is at 29%. Yeah, it's that low. Don't ask me why, I just act rationally. This implies 3.8M of rewards of which 67% goes to 29% of KNC holders (stakers).\n\nBenefit to KNC stakers are 2.8M(total fees)\\*0.062(burn rate) + 2.8M(total fees)\\*0.6732(staking rewards)\\*3.479(1/KNC staking ratio)=6.73M. Adjusting a PE for the staking percent is... tricky.\n\nMarket Cap: 162M\n\nPE: 24.071. That puts it pretty close to fair value again assuming the volume from the past 6 months holds next year.\n\nIf we get another 678% volume growth next year... well that could be fun right?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For Christmas I give you all a PE calculation for KNC for the year.

Basically Katalyst and subsequent votes have reduced the network fee substantially and reduced the rewards to KNC holders by 26.48% which goes to market makers instead. If we just adjust the $1 estimate above that gives us an equivalent price of $.74 which is where it bottomed very recently.</p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s the PE currently? Well assuming that the volume maintains its average of the last 6 months of 320M for the next year that would give us a projected annual volume of 3.8B.</p>\n\n<p>Current KNC staking percent is at 29%. Yeah, it&#39;s that low. Don&#39;t ask me why, I just act rationally. This implies 3.8M of rewards of which 67% goes to 29% of KNC holders (stakers).</p>\n\n<p>Benefit to KNC stakers are 2.8M(total fees)*0.062(burn rate) + 2.8M(total fees)*0.6732(staking rewards)*3.479(1/KNC staking ratio)=6.73M. Adjusting a PE for the staking percent is... tricky.</p>\n\n<p>Market Cap: 162M</p>\n\n<p>PE: 24.071. That puts it pretty close to fair value again assuming the volume from the past 6 months holds next year.</p>\n\n<p>If we get another 678% volume growth next year... well that could be fun right?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-24 22:03:58","distinguished":null,"edited":"2020-12-24 22:24:05","id":"ggyvcnk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kju63a","parent_id":"t3_kju63a","score":34,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/blackdowney","body":"You always have the best insight Logisthebard","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You always have the best insight Logisthebard</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-24 23:56:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ggz2c0r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kju63a","parent_id":"t1_ggyvcnk","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/jumnhy","body":"Beautiful work, my man, much appreciated!
