Taxes. The tax environment for cryptocurrency is, in technical terms, fucking bullshit. While I understand the need for declaring a cost basis & profit/loss, I think anybody who has participated in crypto shenanigans for long enough would agree that some modernization/simplification is in order here. My personal belief is that all exchanges of cryptocurrency for non-cryptocurrency goods/services for amounts under $500 should be treated as \u201ccash purchases\u201d and should incur no tax obligation whatsoever. Further, cost basis & profit/loss reporting could be simplified (especially within DeFi) by allowing many related transactions to be batched/bundled together and reported as one simple transaction.\n\n2.)  ICOs. Many cryptocurrency projects are (may?) be built on top of illegally issued securities. XRP is a high-profile example, but there are undoubtedly many others. My personal belief is that, instead of asking the question \u201cis this product an illegal security or not?\u201d \u2013 we should be asking the question \u201cis there room in the legitimate investment landscape for a risky/non-traditional asset class?\u201d Securities that are issued as cryptocurrencies with a reasonably small market cap should be reclassified as \u201ccaveat emptor\u201d securities & treated similarly to penny stocks/pink sheet/gray market securities.\n\n3.) Stablecoins. I believe it would be prudent for governments throughout the world to set minimum reasonable standards for stablecoins that intend to interact with their traditional financial systems. The primary regulatory goal should be to ensure that centralized entities within the stablecoin industry aren\u2019t defrauding their customers & investors. While it\u2019d be nice for the industry to coalesce around primarily decentralized offerings, it still doesn\u2019t make sense to wait until a financial calamity happens to introduce reasonable standards.\n\n4.) Deregulate Decentralization. It doesn\u2019t make sense to treat decentralized products and entities the same way you would treat a corporation or organization. In fact, it\u2019s essentially impossible to do so. Innovation & risk-taking of this nature is not bound to a national identity or cultural ideal. Banning or prohibiting citizens from willingly participating in decentralized systems will not effectively prevent any behavior \u2013 it will simply shift that economic & creative energy from one form and location to another.

This might be an entirely different bull market than the ones crypto has experienced before due to several different components that are in place now and that weren't in 2013 or in 2016-2018:  \n\n\n**Liquidity**  \n\n\nIn 2013 there was little to no liquidity in the small crypto markets of then. The result was a very quick and aggressive bull market for BTC -- and in the last couple of weeks of it, on the existing \"altcoins\" of back then. In 2016-2018, despite '16 having had been quite the small rises and lesser retraces, followed by more small rises and retraces, '17 followed up with mania. That mania lasted a whole year, still had their nasty quick retraces and consolidations as follow-up. ETH went from single digits to 4 digits, Bitcoin from 3 digits to 5.  \n\n\nNeither the '13 quick bull nor the '16-'18 one had the amount of liquidity that crypto markets have these days. You have now thousands of day traders, a lot more bots, a lot more long term investors and even some institutions pooling up and exchanging between fiat/crypto, crypto/fiat and crypto/crypto. The result of all of this ? Likely longer timeframes between the same % amount of price increases than they would take in the previous bull markets, as well as stronger supports during retraces, which won't make them as deep as before. It'll feel, for everyone, a blessing and a curse both at different times. Patience is key in this one more than previously.  \n\n\n**Composabilty**  \n\n\nThere was basically no composability effects in '13 or in '16-'18. ETH was ETH, BTC was BTC, fiat was fiat, other thing was other thing. You could leverage up less than you can now. You couldn't take loans nor lock your assets to loan others (well, in '17 you could in some exchanges, but the pools would run out fast). You couldn't use your ETH (nor your WBTC) in most of the ways you can these days. If you ask me how will this effect the price action in this bull market, well, I'm not entirely sure, but given it's all part of our wallets ledgers now it will certainly have an effect. Maybe it will even, at very specific points in time ahead, contribute to high/low liquidity events, likely unlike we've seen before at least in similar circumstances. So, composability, while a liquidity vehicle, but be at some points a liquidity deterrent. We'll see.  \n\n\n**Public awareness and mania**  \n\n\nEveryone's heard about crypto at this point. In fact, most of the people I talk with that have never bought or sold crypto have a fairly ok-ish opinion on what's it about. Most aren't experts on DeFi or NFTs, but they might have read somewhere how it's possible to make money these days in it. A lot of them still know crypto as \"Bitcoin\", which, again, might be a blessing for ETH in specific.  \n\n\nSo, there's some amount of awareness, much of it a product of the '17/'18 mania. DeFi and it's ever-expanding applications, the emergent NFT products and markets and something else that might start existing in the future (or several of the new things to come), will have their awareness and mania cycles. We could see on several NFT-applications something resembling the Cryptokitties congestion in the summer of '17.  \n\n\nAll of those cycles will serve to establish ETH as the reserve currency of these adjacent and composable markets. They will bring billions into the ecosystem in the next couple of years. If this perspective of mine ever comes true, ETH's price will suffer upwards from it.  \n\n\n**\"Crypto is easy money\" vs \"Crypto destroyed my finances\" (Markets Psychology)**  \n\n\nIn all bull markets there's some momemtum in which the public opinion about that market is that it's one in which \"it's easy money\", as opposed to in all bear markets there's some in which it's that \"this market has changed my life for the worse\". We've seen here in r/ethfinance, all across the '18'-'20 bear market, hundreds to thousands of comments and posts at how bad these markets were for its participants. Survived pain eventually memesizes on the Internet, so these posts, at some point, became memes and were written in a light-hearted, borderline fun way.  \n\n\nWhenever you see the exact opposite, when people state that \"crypto is so easy money, how could I have taken so long to find out about these markets\" it's when the market psychology will be hitting it's most optimistic phase. Everyone will write like a genius, everyone will feel blessed and everyone else urging caution will be seen as a \"boomer\" or something like that. If we get there and you see this happening, urge caution once or twice after starting to sell/hedge your crypto assets exposure. I guarantee you that your cautionary words will be taken with laughter and mocking from most of the others. That's the crypto bull top and the downfall will be painful.   \n\n\nThis happens with all markets, crypto or not. It's how they naturally and cyclically work.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Do you guys think this is the end of the bull run or it Is  just starting?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My opinion on this is that it&#39;s just starting.

Everyone will write like a genius, everyone will feel blessed and everyone else urging caution will be seen as a &quot;boomer&quot; or something like that. If we get there and you see this happening, urge caution once or twice after starting to sell/hedge your crypto assets exposure.

That&#39;s the crypto bull top and the downfall will be painful.   </p>\n\n<p>This happens with all markets, crypto or not.
