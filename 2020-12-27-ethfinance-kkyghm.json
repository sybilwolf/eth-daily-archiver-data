One thing I didn't go into is that one of the biggest problems for L2 adoption is moving state/value between L2s. If you have some DAI on an Ethereum side-chain and then want to use it on Loopring's L2, you'd have to first transfer the DAI back to L1 Ethereum, which costs gas and might take a few hours, and then pay the gas to transfer it to Loopring's L2, after which you'd finally be able to use your DAI on Loopring's exchange. However, Connext's new product Vector allows you to instantly transfer stuff between L2s using \"state channels\" and [it has been live on a testnet for a while now](https://medium.com/connext/instant-cross-l2-transfers-are-now-on-testnet-2f1295530c22).

Imagine - you're using Synthetix on Optimism ([demo](https://optimism.io/#Demo)), so all transactions are practically free and instant, and then you instantly transfer your unused SNX to whatever L2 Uniswap v3 uses. Then on Uniswap you swap some SNX for ETH and then put both to work by providing them as liquidity. It's again all practically free and instant.
