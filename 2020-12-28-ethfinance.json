But that paper formally lays out how things are a lot worse -- that as the block reward vanishes, the most profitable mining strategy may no longer be the chain with the most work -- directly undermining Bitcoin&#39;s basic design.</p>\n\n<p>The authors end by concluding that it may just be required for cryptcurrencies to maintain a block reward forever, and damn the inflation.  This is not good for bitcoin, but boy -- it makes me <em>really</em> happy that EIP-1559 was devised and is coming along.

Sorry I just now saw this.  Had some post-holiday family obligations.\n\nI have definitely learned some hard lessons.  I'm really guilty of resorting to platitudes when I talk more generally about investing and portfolio management.  I'll try to avoid that here, but no promises.  I've read a few books that I really like, including:\n\nBenjamin Graham--The Intelligent Investor\n\nBurton Malkiel--A Random Walk Down Wall Street\n\nNassim Talib--Skin in the Game\n\nBut the biggest lesson I learn from ALL of them isn't about the answers you will find.  It's about guiding you to ask the right QUESTIONS.  \n\nMake no mistake about it...when we talk about \"investing\" in crypto assets, what we're really talking about is speculation, not investment.  That is starting to change with shit like yield farming, but it's still highly speculative.  I say this because it's different (mostly) than an investment in a business, in which you are investing in a slice of ownership, and hence a slice of their future cash flows.  \n\nSo the questions are: why are you in it?  What do you think you see that the market is missing?  How sure are you that you're correct?  What if you're NOT correct?\n\nEMH (Efficient Market Hypothesis) states that asset prices reflect all knowable information.  When you see volatility, up or down, it means that the market is still assimilating information.  VERY true of crypto.  Those of us in this sub probably have a LOT more information about ETH than most people do.  We see more, read more, and have some expectations about the future of ETH.  When people say ETH will be $10,000, they are saying that markets don't fully understand ETH and that they are missing important knowledge.  Are they right?  I'm not sure.  \n\nWhat I would say is...have a plan.  And have a plan for if you're wrong.  Always ask that question.  What if I'm right?  What if I'm wrong?  \n\nPlatitude: markets can be irrational longer than you can remain solvent.  You might be right, but it might not matter unless you can hang on long enough to figure it out.  \n\nPlatitude: capital preservation is paramount.  Gotta have money to make money.  What this means to me is pretty simple.  Don't quit your day job.  When ETH went from $1400 to $100, I didn't sell.  I didn't quit my day job.  My cost basis was probably around $200 at that time, so it sucked, but I could afford to wait...and even to buy more.  \n\nCorollary: live BELOW your means.  The money I use for investing is LONG horizon money.  I don't need it to make a house payment, pay down loans, or buy a car.  This allows a certain amount of freedom for high-risk, high-reward speculation, like crypto.  If crypto goes to zero, that sucks, but it just means I need to keep working (which I planned to do anyway).  If crypto goes 10x from here, I've got enough invested that it DOES change my life for the better...much better.  \n\nHere is something I DON'T really like.  FIRE.  If you've read all the Financial Independence Retire Early stuff, well, it's good to read about, but I see two things in almost EVERYTHING I read: 1) Smug, holier-than-tho bullshit.  It's SO EASY to make $x million!  ANYBODY can do it! 2) Big missing holes in the narrative.  I always wonder....that person doesn't make any more than me, so do they live on dry ramen, or did grandma pass away gifting them a $500,000 head start that I didn't have?   99% of FIRE literature doesn't add up.  It's mostly garbage.  \n\nAs somebody said above, it's not just about a number going up.  You have to live your life, as well.  I don't deprive myself of good meals, travel, etc...  I'll say it because this is a nested comment that most won't see, but I drive a Tesla.  It was not inexpensive.  I have a wife and a child.  I never want them to feel deprived so Daddy can buy ETH.  \n\nSome of this, then, also requires a certain amount of career management.  I've been REALLY lucky in my mid-career and hit on a side hustle that turned into a business...and a good one, at that. Having income is reallllly helpful and really important.   You don't have to raise your standard of living to MATCH that income (I'd recommend that you not do that!), but don't neglect your earning power in order to stare at your navel on Defi, either.  It's a balance. \n\nBut having income gives you WAY more choices.  You just gotta make 'em.  And you have got to forgive yourself when you screw them up.  \n\nQuick one, here, crypto related:   \n\nIn 2016, I sold 4000 XMR for about a dollar each. I'd been in crypto for about 2 years, average cost maybe $0.60-0.70. But I was killing it with leveraged QQQ's in the stock market. Crypto was mostly sideways for TWO YEARS.  You can look at the charts.\n\nIn January of 2018, I remember multiplying 4000 XMR by the going price of $440 and I about shit myself.\n\nThe lessons...1) don't underestimate crypto, 2) definitely don't listen to me! and 3) you really have to learn how to live with the mistakes you make.

I&#39;m just eyeballing the Bitfinex charts, but it looks like until this run, the longest period BTC had spent above $17k was 3 days (Dec 16-18 2017).</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s now been like, 30? The market has changed now. We have new data points. It just seems false that the previous BTC ATH was a &quot;flash in the pan&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Turning to ETH.. I can accept that 0.15 on the ratio <em>could</em> be an overhyped bit of mania, never to be repeated. It&#39;s certainly an unreasonable benchmark for good performance on ETH/BTC. But 0.0272 is crazy low. Everyone knows that. We were managing 0.04 easily back in Sept, before 20k hype.</p>\n\n<p>So your hypothesis is that ETH over 1k was a freak occurrence, but BTC over 17k (or 20k) was not?
