We seemed to have been looking forward for so long to the launch of the beacon chain, when it finally arrived it felt to me like the next things up on the roadmap were not as clearly signposted to the community - potentially because there are just so many things to get excited about and its really difficult to have a view of everything. Things are moving so quickly. In the end I decided to do some legwork myself and get updates from as close to the sources as possible. Here\u2019s what I found.\n\nHigh level view of some of the big things happening that we should be getting excited about in the Ethereum ecosystem in 2021. Dates are GUESSES by me, and should not be viewed as commitments from the  respective teams.\n\n**Q1 (Jan-Mar) 2021**\n\n* Berlin hard fork\n\n* RocketPool live launch\n\n* Optimistic Rollups\n\n* Uniswap v3\n\n* Edit: the Ethfinance [haiku book](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kkkzbh/the_haiku_book_an_origin_story/)\n\n* Edit: [Coinbase staking](https://blog.coinbase.com/ethereum-2-0-staking-rewards-are-coming-soon-to-coinbase-a25d8ac622d5?gi=9355cb554e22)\n\n**Q2 (Apr-Mar) 2021**\nNothing that I know about yet! Although I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of the Q1 items slipped into Q2\n\n**Q3 (Jul-Sep) 2021**\n\n* The as-yet-unnamed Eth1 hard fork to include EIP-1559\n\n**Berlin hard fork**\n\nThis is the next hard fork of the Eth1 chain. I haven't listed the technical scope of the fork as the changes proposed seem maintenence/health-related, but Berlin is a dependency for EIP-1559. Berlin is planned to go live in early 2021. I believe the teams will be working on finalising the scope and dates for Berlin after the holidays end in January.\n\nFor EIP-1559, the EIP is intended currently to go live in the hard fork after Berlin, so if Berlin is delayed, this may have impacts downstream on EIP-1559.\n\n**RocketPool Live Launch**\n\nRocketPool is a, perhaps THE, decentralised staking solution for Ethereum that will offer the ability for users to stake amounts of Eth lower than the 32 ETH currently required to run a staking node. Stakers will also be able to effectively trade their ETH during the Phase 0 staking lockup period by way of RocketPool\u2019s native rETH token. **RocketPool\u2019s aim is to go live in Q1 2021.** This will be dependant on:\n\n1- the successful completion of the beta currently underway, and updating the beta to include the tokenomics proposal.\n\n2- the completion of code audits and actioning any major vulnerabilities highlighted in those audits, \n\n3- the inclusion of trustless beacon-chain withdrawals in the spec for the next eth2 hard fork.\n\nMore info: the best source of info for RocketPool is the [RP Discord server.](https://discord.com/channels/405159462932971535/405163713063288832)\n\n**Optimistic Rollups and Uniswap v3**\n\nOptimistic rollups is one of the more promising of the various L2 scaling solutions that have been proposed. ORs are currently being tested with the support of various parties including Synthetix, Uniswap, Chainlink, and Coinbase Wallet.\n\nI believe the ambition is to go live with Optimistic Rollups in Q1 2021. This would be followed by (or potentially coincide with) the release of Uniswap V3, which is planned to implement rollups on the Uniswap DEX. This will have massive benefits for the ecosystem as Uniswap is one of the top gas users right now. If the bulk of Uniswap activity can be resolved off-chain, this should reduce congestion on the main Eth1 chain significantly and result in lower gas fees for everyone.\n\nThe best source of info on this is, unfortunately, following the individual twitter feeds for random snippets and rumours. Blargh. Hopefully this will change sometime soon. \n\nEdit: there's also the [Optimism Discord](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/667044844366987296).\n\n**EIP-1559**\n\nThis is the much anticipated proposal to make several changes to Ethereum\u2019s transaction\nfee mechanism, including variable-size blocks, a base fee that rises and falls with\ndemand, and tips for miners. This will lead to more easily predictable gas prices, and should prevent users from overpaying gas fees as much. EIP-1559 should also place deflationary pressure on Eth due to base fees being burnt. Miner tips, albeit hopefully small, are not burnt however, so that aspect is not deflationary.\n\nNote EIP-1559 on its own shouldn\u2019t have much of an impact on lowering gas fees. Gas fees are still going to be high until Ethereum eventually scales, whether that be through L2s or sharding or both.\n\nThe current ambition is to launch EIP-1559 with the Eth1 hard fork following the Berlin fork. Assuming Berlin happens in Q1, this would imply a Q3 date at the earliest for the next one, given the testing that is required for EIP-1559. 1559 has deep impacts across a wide variety of Eth ecosystem processes, so the testing is involved and ongoing.\n\nIf you want to understand the detail behind EIP-1559 the best source is probably the recent Tim Roughgarden report and the associated presentation/Q&A with Vitalik:\n\n* Presentation and Q&A with VB, particularly the first 30 mins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndNyx-Oj9Wk&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=SiliconValleyEthereumMeetup\n\n* Full report text - warning, gets maths-y: http://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf\n\n* Tim Beiko, the project lead, is providing project updates here: https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko\n\nHope some of you found that useful. In terms of other big things happening, I still don\u2019t have a firm grasp of when sharding or \u2018the merge\u2019 are shaping up to be launching, or how Tether\u2019s L2 efforts are progressing, but am endeavouring to get closer to these. I may update and re-post as I learn more.

But then again, from the moment you decide you want to invest in something in order for it to yield you some sort of returns, you must understand that there's no free lunch. There are risks in all types of investments. The key is to identify them and to protect yourself the best you can against them or, if you can't do that due to lack of mechanisms to do so, to weigh the risk you're taking vs the potential return you're expecting.
