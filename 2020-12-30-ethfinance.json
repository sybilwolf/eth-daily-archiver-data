Bitcoin returned to its late 2013 ATH of $1000ish, and went close to 20k by the end of the 2017.</p>\n\n<p>We have made good gains, but we&#39;re not yet knocking ATH&#39;s out of the park and doing 20x on previous ones. BTC hasn&#39;t even done 1.5x yet. If history is repeating, we&#39;re barely starting the run. There is also the possibility that we&#39;re not <em>in</em> another cycle yet, or we&#39;re not <em>getting</em> a repeat.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I think that we are going to see much higher, and I think that the mania is ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Today I was thinking about how so many people who have been through multiple BTC cycles keep expecting large short-term pullbacks and corrections, and they just keep getting bought up.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re in a manic phase when people are just throwing money blindly in and making returns, to cries of &quot;the best time to buy was yesterday&quot;. When the old heads have given up on their sensible short-term bearish pullbacks and are holding up their hands and saying &quot;it&#39;s all gone crazy&quot;. When we have trolls in the daily and comments like &quot;he&#39;s just salty because he sold at $40k BTC / $4K ETH lol&quot;.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-30 13:25:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ghjek0n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kmwen5","parent_id":"t1_ghjccow","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/joshuawakefield","body":"I've been thinking about this too, as I am sure we all have.

I don't know, really, What I know is that when people predict stuff to the upside, they generally underestimate and when they do it to the downside they generally overestimate.\n\nA little historic perspective on how predictions called 'insane' and 'impossible' get their perspective changed a few months later: in November 2016 ETH corrected from $13 to about $6. In the weeks after that, a slow recovery back closer to $10 happened. At that point, people on the Daily of back in the day started making predictions on, if we were finally headed to a bull market, how high would it go. The highest someone stated was $150 per ETH and that was seen as absolute moon, extremely unlikely to happen in the next 5 years of then. That price was hit 5 months later and would correspond to about 1/3 of the local top of that first semester of 2017.\n\nNow, one could argue that the environment in 2017 is different than today. Sure, maybe if we're on a 4 year bull cycle this time we won't have a 70x from our previous ATH, but $10k might look like a bullshit low price at some point during this cycle. My main point is that we have no way to know that accurately and that price perspectives change with time.

I don&#39;t know, really, What I know is that when people predict stuff to the upside, they generally underestimate and when they do it to the downside they generally overestimate.</p>\n\n<p>A little historic perspective on how predictions called &#39;insane&#39; and &#39;impossible&#39; get their perspective changed a few months later: in November 2016 ETH corrected from $13 to about $6. In the weeks after that, a slow recovery back closer to $10 happened. At that point, people on the Daily of back in the day started making predictions on, if we were finally headed to a bull market, how high would it go. The highest someone stated was $150 per ETH and that was seen as absolute moon, extremely unlikely to happen in the next 5 years of then. That price was hit 5 months later and would correspond to about 1/3 of the local top of that first semester of 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Now, one could argue that the environment in 2017 is different than today.

FIFO (First In First Out) that means you are selling 1\u039e from your $100 buy that you first did. You need to pay cap gains on that. So you have made a gain of $900. Depending on your tax laws you need to pay a portion of that in tax. Additionally short term vs long term gains. Where I\u2019m from if I hold that for over 1 year I get a 50% discount on the tax. </p>\n\n<p>So if I\u2019m in the 45% tax bracket (maximum tax rate where I live) and Ive held for under 1 year I need to pay short term cap gains which is 900 * 0.45 = $405</p>\n\n<p>If I\u2019ve held for over 1 year then the tax rate is halved to 22.5% so it would be $202.5</p>\n\n<p>If I go LIFO (Last in first out) I\u2019m selling my buy at $200 so the taxable amount is $800 * 0.45 etc...</p>\n\n<p>If I go for a specific selection then I can pick whatever one I want to sell. So to best lower my taxes I might want to sell the highest first such as my $400 buy so I only have a $600 cap gain.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-30 13:32:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ghjfd42","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kmwen5","parent_id":"t1_ghhmj07","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-30 04:15:38","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-01-30 02:04:04","id":"ghhrbbp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kmwen5","parent_id":"t1_ghhmj07","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":">In your particular case, you won't pay tax since you made a loss.\n\nThere is no way to know this from the information he provided","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>In your particular case, you won&#39;t pay tax since you made a loss.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no way to know this from the information he provided</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-30 07:41:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ghi95ii","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kmwen5","parent_id":"t1_ghhrbbp","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/gamblehejah","body":"To clarify, what is my ETH value is $100K, but I only withdraw $14K?\n\nWouldn\u2019t my gain only be $14K realized, cu that\u2019s the amount I\u2019m withdrawing, and still not a profit over $15K investment?\n\nThe remaining $86K could potentially go to zero tomorrow and not be an actualized gain?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To clarify, what is my ETH value is $100K, but I only withdraw $14K?</p>\n\n<p>Wouldn\u2019t my gain only be $14K realized, cu that\u2019s the amount I\u2019m withdrawing, and still not a profit over $15K investment?</p>\n\n<p>The remaining $86K could potentially go to zero tomorrow and not be an actualized gain?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-30 06:03:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ghhzf4g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kmwen5","parent_id":"t1_ghhrbbp","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"This isn't the way to calculate it.

I was 7x up on my portfolio as a whole in Jan 2018 and was waiting for 10x to cash out even my initial investment!</p>\n\n<p>Similar story with Defi summer. Plus the regret at not buying YFI at 1k after reading Andre\u2019s statement that it \u201chas no value\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>Never again. I\u2019ve sold my all my big airdrops except 1INCH (UNI I just sold today after it crossed 4 again). </p>\n\n<p>Actually I started taking profits at the end of Defi summer - sold a little ETH to buy my wife a long promised engagement ring when it hit 400 in August (we had to return the original before the wedding because the jeweller messed it up and I never got her another till now, two kids and ten years later) and that was a great investment - I don\u2019t regret it. </p>\n\n<p>Actually it\u2019s funny - I have regrets about stuff like not buying YFI early etc but I have absolutely zero regrets about any of the times I have cashed in profits. Literally none. Almost all of my crypto regrets are \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I take my profits then\u201d.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-30 16:48:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ghk2536","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kmwen5","parent_id":"t1_ghjyy2l","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"I'm in Asia so this is a good sight to wake up to.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m in Asia so this is a good sight to wake up to.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-30 17:10:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ghk4mam","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kmwen5","parent_id":"t3_kmwen5","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-30 18:41:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ghkf7q5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kmwen5","parent_id":"t1_ghk4mam","score":-2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Rapidlysequencing","body":"He said Asia.
