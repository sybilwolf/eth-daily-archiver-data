Rarely do a long post but want to share security tips for anyone that is new or needs a refresher, please consider the following security tips to help better secure your crypto funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Have separate emails for your personal activity. For example, have a Gmail (as an example) for purchases, social media, newsletter. Have another one (better services than Gmail are out there) for your financials which should only be used for banking, exchanges, etc. This sensitive email should NOT be used anywhere else whatsoever.\n2. HASH your passwords. Apple is good in providing suggested passwords. But learn how to HASH passwords and have a different HASH per account.\n3. 2FA everything. Remove SMS text messaging verification. Call your mobile provider and enable sim lock. Consider having Google-voice like service for your banking/exchanges separate from your day to day.\n4. Level up your security by purchasing a YUBIKEY.\n5. Purchase a hardware wallet. Yes, ledger's e-commerce database got hacked for a period of orders, but it's still secure. DO NOT SHARE your pass-phrase with anyone or any company at all. I don't give a damn.\n6. PHYSICALLY write down your passphrase on a PIECE OF PAPER, yes like old school times. Store this pass phrase somewhere securely like a safe in your house (purchase one if you dont have one). Do NOT PRINT, SCREEN SHOT, STORE ON CLOUD, or anything digitally close. Consider buying metal plates to stamp your pass phrase so it's fire proof. Store the pass-phrase in different location from you actual ledger for advanced security, but a safe is fine.\n7. Consider using METAMASK WITH HARDWARE WALLET for additional security. This acts has a two phase approach. 1) Have to login into MetaMask, which will allow you to connect to different DEFI protocols. Then you can have the ledger confirm and commit to transaction.\n8. Always double check your ledger when doing a transaction. Read the address, amount being spent, gas, etc.\n9. Of the dedicated address that your hardware wallet generates , COPY the address on your mobile notes application on phone OR a notepad. Why? Because it will avoid you logging into wallet every time you want to check balance. If you are curious, pop in the address on ETHSCAN. LESS hardware usage, the better. Also download any dedicated app that supports your hardware wallet, like ledger live.\n10. Always send a TEST amount first to any address, period. (This is different from interacting with a protocol).. So if you are sending 1ETH from one address to another, send a test amount first, confirm, and then send the rest. It's just a good habit.\n11. IF YOU ARE HODLING (HOLDING long time frame) then remove your crypto from exchanges. STORE THEM on the hardware ledger. Case closed.\n12. If you need a burner wallet, considering creating another account under the same METAMASK parent account (point 5). Metamask mobile is great, and you can have more than 1 account which all links to the same parent account. REMEMBER TO SECURE THE RECOVERY PASS PHRASE somewhere SAFE (see point 4).\n13. LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS to your partner, friends, lover, children, whomever in-case you are OUT OF TOWN, SOMETHING UNFORTUANTE HAPPENS, etc. All of this is NOT straight forward, so leave instructions and secure it accordingly.\n14. Desktop/laptop Users\n   1. Download BRAVE/FIREFOX BROWSER, download METAMASK from official website ( DO NOT GOOGLE and click on Ads). Use dedicated browser with BOOKMARKED sites to interact with DEFI protocols, exchanges, etc. NOTHING ELSE.\n   2. Use separate browser (of the one not used above as an example) and set security settings to erase all history/cookies/personal activity upon EXIT. This browser can be your roaming if NEED TO BE.\n   3. The above 2 points are if you only have access to 1 computer/laptop, but a better practice it to have a dedicated hard-drive with an operating system like Linux or Windows where your crypto activity is done. This will separate and not comprise one from the other. VM is fine but still can be comprised through root access. You will have to choose boot option to login in one or the other OS.\n   4. For windows, use CCLEANER/Windows Defender.\n15. Clean up your digital footprint. Your email can be comprised from a series of positions such as newsletters, retail stores where you are subscribed to updates, etc. Social media accounts not being used? Delete. Accounts that are old? Delete. Remove your personal information where possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is NOT to scare anyone by any means, but let's be honest.. We are in and advancing/racing towards a more digital world. With the latest SolarWinds hack, MSFT source code was exposed (to what application is TBD). But this is becoming normal and will increase. Crypto is NOT AT FAULT, it's the intent of those that want to hack be that it's physically or digitally.\n\nTake the necessary steps, protect yourself, live a low-key life both physically and digitally, and take caution of every step. Create a maze to make it difficult to get comprised. If ONE AREA is comprised, you have SAFE-GUARDED another which is how you win.\n\nHope for the best, prep for the worst. Cheers everyone! May this bull-run be in our favor!\n\nWould love for this to be a sticky if something doesn't exist already.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Happy New Year to everyone!

Because it will avoid you logging into wallet every time you want to check balance. If you are curious, pop in the address on ETHSCAN. LESS hardware usage, the better. Also download any dedicated app that supports your hardware wallet, like ledger live.</li>\n<li>Always send a TEST amount first to any address, period. (This is different from interacting with a protocol).. So if you are sending 1ETH from one address to another, send a test amount first, confirm, and then send the rest. It&#39;s just a good habit.</li>\n<li>IF YOU ARE HODLING (HOLDING long time frame) then remove your crypto from exchanges. STORE THEM on the hardware ledger. Case closed.</li>\n<li>If you need a burner wallet, considering creating another account under the same METAMASK parent account (point 5). Metamask mobile is great, and you can have more than 1 account which all links to the same parent account. REMEMBER TO SECURE THE RECOVERY PASS PHRASE somewhere SAFE (see point 4).</li>\n<li>LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS to your partner, friends, lover, children, whomever in-case you are OUT OF TOWN, SOMETHING UNFORTUANTE HAPPENS, etc. All of this is NOT straight forward, so leave instructions and secure it accordingly.</li>\n<li>Desktop/laptop Users\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download BRAVE/FIREFOX BROWSER, download METAMASK from official website ( DO NOT GOOGLE and click on Ads). Use dedicated browser with BOOKMARKED sites to interact with DEFI protocols, exchanges, etc. NOTHING ELSE.</li>\n<li>Use separate browser (of the one not used above as an example) and set security settings to erase all history/cookies/personal activity upon EXIT. This browser can be your roaming if NEED TO BE.</li>\n<li>The above 2 points are if you only have access to 1 computer/laptop, but a better practice it to have a dedicated hard-drive with an operating system like Linux or Windows where your crypto activity is done. This will separate and not comprise one from the other. VM is fine but still can be comprised through root access. You will have to choose boot option to login in one or the other OS.</li>\n<li>For windows, use CCLEANER/Windows Defender.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Clean up your digital footprint. Your email can be comprised from a series of positions such as newsletters, retail stores where you are subscribed to updates, etc. Social media accounts not being used? Delete. Accounts that are old? Delete. Remove your personal information where possible.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This is NOT to scare anyone by any means, but let&#39;s be honest.. We are in and advancing/racing towards a more digital world. With the latest SolarWinds hack, MSFT source code was exposed (to what application is TBD). But this is becoming normal and will increase. Crypto is NOT AT FAULT, it&#39;s the intent of those that want to hack be that it&#39;s physically or digitally.</p>\n\n<p>Take the necessary steps, protect yourself, live a low-key life both physically and digitally, and take caution of every step. Create a maze to make it difficult to get comprised. If ONE AREA is comprised, you have SAFE-GUARDED another which is how you win.</p>\n\n<p>Hope for the best, prep for the worst. Cheers everyone! May this bull-run be in our favor!</p>\n\n<p>Would love for this to be a sticky if something doesn&#39;t exist already.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-01 13:45:20","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-01-01 13:49:32","id":"ghrhn5u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ko67py","parent_id":"t3_ko67py","score":61,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Mhotdemnot","body":"Excellent post","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Excellent post</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-01 14:10:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ghrki74","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ko67py","parent_id":"t1_ghrhn5u","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/INTMMTSIR","body":"Thank you!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-01 14:13:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ghrktma","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ko67py","parent_id":"t1_ghrki74","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"1.

To determine how often you can expect to propose a block, divide total number of validators by 7200. `67791/7200 = 9.4`, so you can expect to propose a new block **on average** every 9.4 days right now. Based on the design of the beacon chain, this number will only increase as more funds are locked as we wait for the Eth1 -> Eth2 merge to enable transactions on Eth2.\n\nThe reward for a block proposal is about 0.00250 Ether, or about $1.85 at current exchange rates. These proposals are a little bit like mined blocks - if you were a solo miner this would be your only reward and it definitely wouldn't be worth the effort, but...\n\nThe current reward for attestations, which are submitted by a validator every 6.4 minutes (1 epoch is 32 slots, a slot is every 12 seconds) is about 0.00005 Ether, or about 3.7 US cents. This kind of adds up - a validator who has been attesting since genesis now has about 0.42 Ether in attestor rewards. These rewards are much more like pooled mining rewards that come consistently no matter what.\n\nThere are currently about 19,100 validators in the queue waiting to be activated on the beacon chain, this means that anyone who deposits today can expect to wait about 21 days before being able to earn rewards, the network is designed to add 900 new validators every day to prevent dramatic swings in participation.\n\nThe beacon chain will be most successful when lots of people turn on solo miners at home - due to the low power usage and low maintenance of the system solo mining at home is much less impactful than GPU mining. Learning to set up a solo miner does have  a learning curve, but persons who are familiar with linux can set up a validator on prysm, lighthouse, teku, or nimbus in about 90 minutes.\n\nSolo mining is important because it will help the chain maintain long-term decentralization. Right now, the biggest single validator depositor is Kraken with [8024 validators](https://beaconcha.in/validators/eth1leaderboard). This isn't wrong - but it does mean that Kraken and other large validators may have a greater impact on the network if they experience problems.

I'm personally quite opposite of a libertarian. I believe in effective nimble government at a federal level; and that includes knowing who has how much. It seems to me that that transparency is what makes a ledger based financial system so powerful; not privacy. \n\nThe reason Bitcoin has any value at all is because we can see where each Bitcoin is transacted; and we can verify there aren't double spending/check chasing/unfair interest rates, etc. \n\nEthereum takes that security and the inefficient computation and adds the ability to program in top of it. Ethereum is like when they figured out recirculation and multiple pistons on a steam engine. \n\nFrom a wasteful but revolutionary engine; to what is still one of the most efficient engine designs there is. \n\nFor me, one of the greatest things blockchain can (will) do is eliminating our current accounting model. Too much arbitration but decades of power has allowed them to codify their necessity in business.
