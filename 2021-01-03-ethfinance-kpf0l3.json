(well, for now it's just OVER $1000!)  But I'll try.  Paging u/DCinvestor.\n\nI played some shitcoin roulette in 2014 and 2015, but I gave it up for hodl.  I still have XMR I bought in 2014, but other than that I've been all in on ETH and BTC.  I never sodled anything during the bear market...in fact bought more, though not a ton.  I hibernated.\n\nIn my mind there are some IMPORTANT things that I really missed out on during my hibernation.  I missed the dawn of the DeFi era.  Related to this, I missed out on the creation of synthetic assets.  In my mind, these developments are HUGE.\n\n* Total market cap for US stocks is maybe $36-38 trillion.\n* Global M2 Money supply is probably $85-100 trillion.\n* Total market cap for all derivatives is something like $650 trillion (and I've seen much higher estimates).\n\nIn my mind, BTC really is digital gold (total supply $10 trillion).  You can like it or not, but the finite supply MATTERS and EIP-1559 doesn't solve that for (at least) 2 years.\n\nBUT....and this is a big BUT...DeFi and synthetics takes ETH from being a player in global M2 to being a player in the global derivatives market.  I think that a beautifully functioning, mature DeFi system with synthetic assets makes the top end of the possible market cap of ETH worth about 6x what I had previously thought.\n\nSo in the last two weeks, I have burned up some ETH in gas fees and I've put in some new money in order to learn more about this ecosystem.   Here is an incomplete list of what I've done:\n\n* Bought and staked $AAVE.\n* Bought and staked $SNX.\n* In order to kill two birds with one stone (learn while also getting exposure to DeFi assets), I put the sUSD into synthetics: sBTC and sDEFI.\n* Bought more sUSD than what I received staking so I could 1) get the return on Aave, and 2) buy more synths.\n* Also bought some PieDao Defi+L and YPIE.\n* Because I think South Korea is a player, I also bought and staked $MIR (Mirror Protocol has way more equity-related synths) and I bought but didn't stake $LUNA.\n* Bought but didn't stake $HEGIC.\n\n(ALL new money.  Didn't sell ANY precious ETH!  In fact, I actually have more ETH because I bought some for gas for all these flippin' transactions.)\n\nThe one that I'm most puzzled by is $SNX.  In theory, I love the notion of synths.  It's really important in the long run.  But what I don't like is that once I've staked and created the debt, I am really competing against other traders for return.  The staked SNX guarantees it.  Because I'm in sBTC and sDEFI, I'm doing fine.  But you really CAN'T buy sNIKKEI or sOIL because you'll get KILLED by the traders who are in high-returning assets.\n\nSome questions:\n\n* Is there really any reason to stake $SNX?  The rewards are damn good, but if you stake and you DON'T generate a return on the sUSD, the rewards don't (CAN'T) compensate for the debt escalation.  I'm not a good enough trader in the long run to make it work.  I've been lucky because I happened to be in the right assets over the last ten days.\n* Couldn't one just as easily hodl $SNX and then trade synths with sUSD acquired from a DEX?  How is that NOT a better play?  $SNX seems like a good hodl right now.  Some of the synths are also VERY interesting.  I'm not going to do this, but I could imagine dumping all my XMR for sXMR, especially if it gets de-listed from other exchanges.\n* So far, I absolutely loathe the Luna/Mir ecosystem.  I like the synths much BETTER on Mirror, but it's really not at all user-friendly.  The transactions go through ETH, but you have to use a separate (Terra) wallet.  You can't easily flip either the synths or even the $MIR or $LUNA on a DEX.   Is there any reason I shouldn't just exit those positions?  Will L2 solve this issue?  Mirror Protocol just seems really separate from the rest of the ETH ecosystem.\n* What else am I missing?  What is important that I'm not asking about?\n\nThank you to anybody willing to engage in this during a massive bull.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This may not be the right discussion for a crowded daily, especially as we go back and forth over and under $1000.

As we all feel and know, ETH is still severely undervalued, particularly vs BTC on this recent run. Today's cuecomber helps, but really only brought us back to .028 on the ratio, not even to the .03 levels prior to BTC breaking ATH. So: what's next?\n\nWell, in USD we rejected pretty much right off 980, which was a pseudo resistance level from the prior ATH. 980 was a short consolidation on the way up, and a double top on the way down. Past that, there's a range of resistance between 1150 - 1200, and then it's on to the final boss. As long as we stay above ~830 support for now, I'm not too worried. Although given the way we blasted through that level this morning, it may not mean much. Was just a rough level I had noted from 2017. Below that, 760 since we just spent a few days there.\n\nLooking at the ratio, still a ways to go. We need to reclaim the .03 range (should happen soon?), but the real resistance is around .04, which at current BTC prices would be right around ATH (~1360). From there the next big level is probably .06, then .07, then .085... you get the idea, it's all resistance. Let's reclaim .04 and .06 first, and then I'll try to make sense of what's next.\n\nLooking at the ~~tea leaves~~ oscillators for ETH... well, they're all overcooked, on every timeframe. But I don't think they're that useful in a true bull market, because they'll stay overbought for much longer than seems reasonable in normal market conditions. I just look at them because other traders do too. Which, the good news: BTC having a minor correction while ETH ran was a literal best case scenario. The overbought indicators there all came back to slightly more reasonable levels, and relieves some of the pressure in the short term. \n\nAnd honestly, since breaking ATH, BTC hasn't really seen a single real (30-40%) correction. It's going to happen eventually, but this time really does feel a bit different in that the presence of institutional buyers really is making it feel like \"number only go up.\" How many whales have iceberg orders and are steadily buying up any and every dip that happens? BTC hasn't had a single 10+% correction since breaking ATH, and only one 15% correction since 10k. \n\nThat's *fucking crazy.*\n\nBTC will correct, but how high will it go before then? It already feels like peak euphoria in the general sentiment, which is usually a bad sign, but I could also see  running into the 40ks before any real correction. Or maybe it's right around the corner, based on today's PA. I had a bunch of pre-set sell levels set. But based on how this has gone and depending on when and how much BTC really corrects, I may get greedy and set the levels higher based on how bullish this market feels.\n\nLastly... the ETHE investor unlocking this week. ETHE usually doesn't affect ETH price, but given the volume that might be dumped and the fact that we just had this big run up... might provide a catalyst for a correction. Probably won't, just something I've been thinking about and will be watching closely this week.\n\nSo that's a ton of words to say \"who the fuck knows.\" I'm just going to keep buying until ETH gets well into the 4-digits, and keep looking out for DeFi blue chips that lag behind the pumps.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some (not so) quick TA amidst the euphoria.

From there the next big level is probably .06, then .07, then .085... you get the idea, it&#39;s all resistance. Let&#39;s reclaim .04 and .06 first, and then I&#39;ll try to make sense of what&#39;s next.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the <del>tea leaves</del> oscillators for ETH... well, they&#39;re all overcooked, on every timeframe. But I don&#39;t think they&#39;re that useful in a true bull market, because they&#39;ll stay overbought for much longer than seems reasonable in normal market conditions. I just look at them because other traders do too. Which, the good news: BTC having a minor correction while ETH ran was a literal best case scenario. The overbought indicators there all came back to slightly more reasonable levels, and relieves some of the pressure in the short term. </p>\n\n<p>And honestly, since breaking ATH, BTC hasn&#39;t really seen a single real (30-40%) correction. It&#39;s going to happen eventually, but this time really does feel a bit different in that the presence of institutional buyers really is making it feel like &quot;number only go up.&quot; How many whales have iceberg orders and are steadily buying up any and every dip that happens? BTC hasn&#39;t had a single 10+% correction since breaking ATH, and only one 15% correction since 10k. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s <em>fucking crazy.</em></p>\n\n<p>BTC will correct, but how high will it go before then? It already feels like peak euphoria in the general sentiment, which is usually a bad sign, but I could also see  running into the 40ks before any real correction. Or maybe it&#39;s right around the corner, based on today&#39;s PA. I had a bunch of pre-set sell levels set. But based on how this has gone and depending on when and how much BTC really corrects, I may get greedy and set the levels higher based on how bullish this market feels.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly... the ETHE investor unlocking this week. ETHE usually doesn&#39;t affect ETH price, but given the volume that might be dumped and the fact that we just had this big run up... might provide a catalyst for a correction. Probably won&#39;t, just something I&#39;ve been thinking about and will be watching closely this week.</p>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s a ton of words to say &quot;who the fuck knows.&quot; I&#39;m just going to keep buying until ETH gets well into the 4-digits, and keep looking out for DeFi blue chips that lag behind the pumps.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-03 10:27:54","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-01-03 10:35:23","id":"ghz897g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kpf0l3","parent_id":"t3_kpf0l3","score":25,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BestFill","body":"Thanks sir.
