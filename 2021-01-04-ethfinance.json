The disbursal will be spread out for at least three days\" \n\nMeaning this - the sell pressure will be there at least a few more days as not every share was issued and available for sale today. And while the premium fell hard (and I'm not sure how much more blood can be taken from this stone), I ran the math before and a lot of these folks bought in at the equivalent of $1.50 to $2.50 and are still staring a nice gain / some premium to arb right in the face. \n\nAnd as an aside - it should be said that dashby1 is a true OG when it comes to ETHE. He was the ballsy one who rode that ridiculous premium on the first go around at launch and is very knowledgeable. Thanks for posting this!\n\nAlso, the r/ethereum sub had a post about why ETHE crashed - [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kqaoev/why_is_grayscale_ethe_stock_crashing/).

The premium imploded due to the MASSIVE influx of shares (12 month to 6 month wait time change) so cheap ETHE for everyone! Take a scroll through the daily and you find some good discussion. That said, two links worth a share:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/dashby1\">u/dashby1</a> posted something I think everyone trading this should read - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kq2mi0/daily_general_discussion_january_4_2021/gi3ap5q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">HERE</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>From my source (crypto hedge fund manager):<br/>\n&quot;The lockup period ended today, but a significant number of share holders still don&#39;t have access to sell. The disbursal will be spread out for at least three days&quot; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meaning this - the sell pressure will be there at least a few more days as not every share was issued and available for sale today. And while the premium fell hard (and I&#39;m not sure how much more blood can be taken from this stone), I ran the math before and a lot of these folks bought in at the equivalent of $1.50 to $2.50 and are still staring a nice gain / some premium to arb right in the face. </p>\n\n<p>And as an aside - it should be said that dashby1 is a true OG when it comes to ETHE. He was the ballsy one who rode that ridiculous premium on the first go around at launch and is very knowledgeable. Thanks for posting this!</p>\n\n<p>Also, the <a href=\"/r/ethereum\">r/ethereum</a> sub had a post about why ETHE crashed - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kqaoev/why_is_grayscale_ethe_stock_crashing/\">HERE</a>. And while questions are always welcome in our daily, I figured I&#39;d throw that link out before it gets asked again in response to this post. A lot more in-depth discussion there.</p>\n\n<p>Note - Issuance closed due to end of quarter reporting so just posting the price. Usually lasts about 3 weeks (1/15 ish).

That said, I&#39;ll continue buying each week, as I&#39;ve been doing, but I do get a bit hesitant and second-guess my purchase decisions and timing after major jumps in price. Being in crypto this long has made me... basically emotionless and not much phases me (crashes, major jumps in price, etc), but the one flaw that remains is a kind of fear of buying at the top (I bought some around $1300 a few years ago and I think I have ptsd from it lol) </p>\n\n<p>Sorry, I know this comment wasn&#39;t all that helpful, but I&#39;d rather admit that I really just don&#39;t know, then give advice that comes across as if I do know. The only thing I <em>do</em> know is that I have faith in ETH which is why I continue to buy regularly. Now I just need to start figuring out how to cash out (or find a method of using ETH for a downpayment on a house) without having roughly half my profits vanish (between taxes, and the profit&#39;s effect on my income-based student debt payments)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-04 08:40:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gi2xuwn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kq2mi0","parent_id":"t1_gi2sxw8","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Jacobiangod","body":"Fly to Cayman Islands, open account, transfer money, charter plane back home?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Fly to Cayman Islands, open account, transfer money, charter plane back home?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-04 08:55:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gi2zsqh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kq2mi0","parent_id":"t1_gi2xuwn","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pfloyd2357","body":"Sounds... sketchy lol.

Everyone uses $10k ETH as a meme around here but if you were to take all the fundamentals into consideration, would you REALLY say that $10k ETH is overpriced? I personally wouldn&#39;t. The bubble starts when dumb money gets in - people who don&#39;t know anything and believe any stupid thing. I know that because that was me in 2017. I&#39;m basing my estimate on a $200k-$300k BTC with a BTC/ETH ratio at a new ATH (&gt;0.16). I&#39;m 60% sure $40k is not impossible and 90% sure $10k will be left away in dust. Right now on this sub you&#39;re seeing 3 types of people: old investors who know what&#39;s up but are being super conservative, newer ones who got in during the Winter and the investors fueling the first wave of this new cycle (for example acquaintances of the first two categories). The pump we had a couple of days ago felt like it had 0 resistance, even though we&#39;ve been there historically. The more we go into uncharted territory, the less resistance there is. </p>\n\n<p>This comment is more like a brainstorm of ideas but I hope you get my point.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-04 21:59:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gi5kg5m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kq2mi0","parent_id":"t1_gi3ldox","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"Fair enough, I get it.
