Accumulate a stack you're happy with, before the bull market starts (the hardest part!).  I had this done a year ago ;).  \n2.  Choose a \"gotta sell some\" price.  We may already have reached that level for many in the current cycle; personally, my first long-planned sell went through two days ago at $982.  \n3.  Choose a \"we won't get there, but I can dream\" price.  For me, that's $20,000 over the next 1-3 years.  \n4.  Decide how much of your pre-bull stack you're willing to sell.  I'm staking 50% for life (already deposited), with 40% to be sold for USD and 10% earmarked for BTC.  \n5.  Split your sales into a decent number of lots.  How many is up to you, but I think it should be at least 4; I went with 16 chunks of 2.5% each for USD, and 4 chunks for 2.5% each for BTC.  \n6.  Spread your sales evenly in log space, because crypto markets don't scale linearly.  The only reason you should ever be looking at linear charts is to remind yourself what noobs are seeing.  Practically speaking, take the ratio of your dream price to your minimum price, and raise it to the reciprocal of the number of lots minus one power.  In my case, that ratio is $20,000/$982 = 20.4.  20.4^(1/15) = 1.22.  This means setting each subsequent sell price 22% higher than the last will space 16 sells evenly over the interval between $982 and $20,000, in log space.  I'll never have to see the price go up 25% over that interval without feeling rewarded.  \n7. Stick to your planned sell prices without fail.  Don't second-guess.  Don't overthink it.  Just stick to the plan.  If you have an exchange you trust, park at least some of your sell stack there, set limit orders, and forget about them.  Enjoy getting rich without stress.  \n\nShould you listen to a stranger on the internet?  That's entirely up to you.  I did the manic trading thing, and I was spectacularly good at it.

LTC is worth $150.88 which means the LTCN being <strong>traded</strong> is backed by $1,552,555 of value.</p>\n\n<p>Think about how small a market that is in terms of trading.

Staking with Lido is now live. \n>https://twitter.com/lidofinance/status/1340105993020198920\n>Some of the distributed key holders and investors are Rune (MakerDAO), Michael (curve), Banteg (yearn finance), Kain (Synthetix) and Stani (Aave). \n>https://twitter.com/lidofinance/status/1338813683561082880\n>Looks like a solid project and it seems that the team has been able to assemble some of the big hitters in the defi space, which is promising for stETH (Lido's eth2.0 derivative) integration in the various defi protocols. I am not so happy about the economics and distribution of the corresponding LDO governance token, as only 36% are allocated to the DAO-controlled treasury. That being said, there is no need to hold the LDO token in order to stake.\n\n>Just a heads-up, there is chatter about a Badger-style targeted airdrop for early adopters. Still early days but might be worth interacting with the protocol in case there is a successful governance vote.\n\nThe airdrop is currently being voted on \n\nhttps://mainnet.lido.fi/#/lido-dao/0x2e59a20f205bb85a89c53f1936454680651e618e/vote/20/\n\nAnd you can check if your address is eligible here \n\nhttps://github.com/vshvsh/ldo-airdrop/blob/master/snapshot/lido-07a-human-readable-balances.json \n\nIt looks like this first airdrop really only rewards stakers who have taken on additional risk by depositing ETH early on. The cutoff block was around 10 days after genesis. There are however ideas discussed in the governance forum to have a second airdrop with a future cutoff block.
