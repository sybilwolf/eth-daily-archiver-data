So I just walked in one day, arranged for like an 11am meeting, and announced quitting. Boss was mega pissed, at one point throwing a stapler about 8 inches to the left of my head. Cursing, saying nonsense of knowing everyone in the city so I\u2019d never get a job again (clearly, he was not grasping the idea that I was quitting forever and that doublewordscore_resume.pdf was never needed ever again)</p>\n\n<p>Security then was called to escort me out bc they didn\u2019t want me to access files which is dumb on their part bc if I wanted to, I\u2019d have backed up everything <em>before</em> quitting. Had to get coworkers get my jacket + headphones + other belongings</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-06 10:23:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gibuk4t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_krhqzc","parent_id":"t1_gibso11","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethrevolution","body":"Wow. \nSounds like your boss was quite liquid in insecurities!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wow. \nSounds like your boss was quite liquid in insecurities!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-06 10:32:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gibvnj5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_krhqzc","parent_id":"t1_gibuk4t","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"Fucking Legend, congrats DC!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Fucking Legend, congrats DC!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-06 09:09:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gibkfg7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_krhqzc","parent_id":"t1_gibjh59","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Chapo_Rouge","body":"Endgame stuff right there !
