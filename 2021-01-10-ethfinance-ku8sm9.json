wanted to give a success story from an older (late late 40s) user. Back in 2016 I was worried about having all of my retirement savings in standard mutual funds and such. I felt that I wasn't really diversified. My wife and I are self employed and live within our means but retirement will always be up to us and after the 2007 housing bust it was hard to see hundreds of thousands we had saved and earned in accounts go poof. I know things bounce back but still it felt awful.\n\nSo in 2016 I bought some BTC. I went to coinbase and eventually bought around 20 with some money we had gotten out of our mortgage when refinancing. Then something else came along. ETH was offered on CB. So I bought 200 and then some more and more. My first buys were at $14 or so and some a little lower and then a few when things went crazy at $350 or so (i know that is a repeating event in this space).\n\nLike a used 15 of the BTC for shitcoins in the ICO craze. (Anyone need some IGNT?) but I kept all my eth. Over 1000 of them. Then in January  of 2018 when I should have been selling some I was caught up in the euphoria of ethtrader and set my first target of $1600.\n\nUgh.\n\nAnyway I HODLed all the way down and rode it back up to yesterday. My new target was set roughly around$1350 but after watching things unfold last night I decided to sell some at $1325-$1330.\n\nWell I sold about $300k and am going to pay off my house. I firmly believe that things will go up and an in this for the staking but I wanted to enjoy some sort of win financially. My mortgage rate is fine but I am old and just want to have that bill gone as I have been paying it for 20 years already through 3 mortgages.\n\nMy new strategy is to sell another 200 or so at some mind melting new ATH to buy junk and then try to sell another 400 on the way down as things look like they are becoming bearish. I will keep 20% untouched and attempt to buy back with the 400 sold at a considerably lower price if that happens. If not I will be fine with poor timing and new liquidity. Seeing $90 ETH after not selling any of the way down last run was rough. When I say sold I mean something like DAI. When I buy back I will try to get a few BTC mixed back in.\n\nI never wanted to be rich so I have some issues to sort through if the staking goes bananas. Charity and keeping off the hedonistic treadmill are my main goals. I will still travel a bunch while trying to reduce my carbon footprint.\n\nI have a love hate relationship with this place and reddit in general. I finally deleted my 13 year old reddit account last year as the signal to noise ratio is ever worsening  and addiction to this stuff is higher than ever. I do however really appreciate all of you in here that tell newer investors to have a plan and stick to it. Watching the numbers go up and the memes come out makes it a rough battle to fight.\n\nHave a great run!  (Written in Brave running TOR on a VPN with a trash email.

To me, investing is as much about predicting the future as making a return on capital, particularly when my bet is contrarian / held by a minority of people. We're not done yet, but it feels great to have my conviction in ETH be validated (no pun intended) by the market. But this also means that I live in the future. I frequently obsess about Ethereum's progress, different ongoing developments, and what all the implications are for the future. I found that being so future-centric takes away from living in the moment.\n\n(2) It's difficult to mute the what ifs. What if I bought more at $200, what if I borrowed some money to buy more, what if I used leverage... Relatedly, I find myself comparing myself to other folks that made a killing in crypto / equities in the past year. While I haven't done poorly myself, the envy is real. I can relate to why people say money doesn't make you happy. \n\nFrom (1) and (2), I decided I need to work on my internal state and better controlling my monkey mind.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The hockey stick run in ETH&#39;s price in the past year (~9x from a year ago of $145) helped me better understand a couple things about myself:</p>\n\n<p>(1) Being right brings me almost as much satisfaction as making money.
