Because historically we&#39;ve had 5+ dips in every bull cycle, which is health y for PA (Price Action). The point of these dips is two fold, to serve as opportunities and to test those who can ride it out. Trading is nothing more than exchange of wealth from one to another. We may dip tomorrow, but maybe 5-10% dip, but these massive 30%+ dips support healthy growth, or a reset to a new support level. Then we build again, euphoria comes and goes, then reset. Then continue it again until party is over. And sadly, people will come back.. why? It&#39;s an addiction once you get a hang of it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 17:01:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"giy6756","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t1_giy5t38","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/HelpOnAdMe1","body":"Just want to share what the sentiment was like back in April.

It wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing to drop down to 800s, 900s. But there is a lot of buying stacked from 900-950. I don&#39;t expect much of that to go lower, those are buys in waiting rather than walls to be moved.</p>\n\n<p>I saw a comment in an <a href=\"/r/cc\">/r/cc</a> thread &quot;why <em>can&#39;t</em> it just go up? what&#39;s healthy about a retrace?&quot;. But I think that the intuitive answer is correct. When things go parabolic and then vertical, even the OG big holders say to themselves &quot;OK, this is ridiculous&quot;. That is what triggers a blow off top and big sell-off. Moves like this delay that situation (although it is more or less inevitable). And I haven&#39;t seen the manic vertical peak yet, nor the old heads saying &quot;time to exit&quot;.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 04:18:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"givekyu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t1_givdska","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"So, bitfinex longed themselves with some tether printing and sold the absolute top for 1.8 million ETH.... impressive. > $2.000.000.000\n\nThe books are back in balance \ud83d\ude0a\nAnd its crazy that this actually works \ud83d\ude01 its like banks, they are also allowed to lend out money they dont have and ask the double back \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a #cryptoadoption","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So, bitfinex longed themselves with some tether printing and sold the absolute top for 1.8 million ETH.... impressive. &gt; $2.000.000.000</p>\n\n<p>The books are back in balance \ud83d\ude0a\nAnd its crazy that this actually works \ud83d\ude01 its like banks, they are also allowed to lend out money they dont have and ask the double back \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a #cryptoadoption</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 10:59:16","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-01-11 14:10:23","id":"giwwn5f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t3_kuwmeo","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/itcouldvebeensogood","body":"source?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>source?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 11:12:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"giwyfw0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t1_giwwn5f","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"His/her ass, but its probably true","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>His/her ass, but its probably true</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 11:21:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"giwzlia","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t1_giwyfw0","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"This","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 11:23:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"giwzwmp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t1_giwzlia","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/ec265","body":"It\u2019s not *what* you know...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s not <em>what</em> you know...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 11:01:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"giwx03d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t1_giwwn5f","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Its pretty obvious if you ask me...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Its pretty obvious if you ask me...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 11:07:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"giwxr34","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t1_giwx03d","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"If it drops further\n\nBuy more\n\nIf it stays the same \n\nBuy more","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If it drops further</p>\n\n<p>Buy more</p>\n\n<p>If it stays the same </p>\n\n<p>Buy more</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 11:46:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gix2yyd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t3_kuwmeo","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"Cool decision tree.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Cool decision tree.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 11:57:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gix4esu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t1_gix2yyd","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/onguito","body":"If it goes up\n\nBuy more","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If it goes up</p>\n\n<p>Buy more</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-11 12:06:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gix5isx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kuwmeo","parent_id":"t1_gix2yyd","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Mrs_Willy","body":"If you wanted a strong chart, Its this.

There's still gonna be selling pressure, but it'd be pointless to sell below NAV (currently 0.0103 ETH / share), so I'm hoping that'll just keep the premium low, and make it track ETH better for a while.  So the only reason those unlocked shares should get sold below NAV is the same reason the rest of us would sell -- cause we think ETH itself is going lower.\n\nIf GBTC is anything to go by, a target premium of 10-20% is probably sustainable -- which makes sense to me, that's about the savings you'd get for not having to pay taxes by trading ETHE within a Roth.   I mostly stop buying when the premium gets too far up (30% or more), even if ETH is on a run -- though I'm not sure about that strategy.\n\nGiven all those factors, I'm gambling that $900-$950 ETH will remain support for a little while, meaning any ETHE around $11.xx is a buy for me ($900 * 1.2 * 0.0103 = $11.12).
