And it's the reason I kind of like the comparison. Digital yield is hard to sell to the average person. Talking about interest rates already causes a glazed over look in people eyes. Digital Gold makes sense and Digital Oil also makes sense. I'll copy and paste some of my responses from yesterday's thread concerning my thought process.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kuwmeo/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2021/giy5laf/\n\n\n>I was more thinking along the lines that almost everything in the world needs oil. Oil to heat homes, travel, electricity, manufacturing, etc. It is crucial in the most basic operations and functions of the economy. Where as Gold, while still has its manufacturing purposes, is less important.\n\n>If Ethereum tokenized the world, it will be as crucial to the economic operations of the world as much as oil is.\n\nI think you might be taking the digital oil comparison a little too literal. It's just an attempt to compare something digital to a physical commodity. Eth is also a lot more than digital yield. It's one aspect of what ETH offers. Bankless hosts likes to call it a triple point asset and the best evolution of money, I like that narrative a lot. \n\nEthereum is the Internet of Money (IoM) :)\n\n\nI agree with you that digital oil might carry a lot of negative connotations but I think it also reinforces the idea of how crucial it is in the operation of open finance and the ethereum network.\n\n\nYou also mention coexistence with bitcoin. Maybe for now. But In the extreme long term I don't see a reason why bitcoin needs to exist. I'm certain it will still exist. It just becomes really, really, hard to justify bitcoins existence. You can say it's the longest running, most secure, crypto but there will come a point where ethereum earns that badge of long running and secure. And then what does bitcoin offer.l besides that. Let's travel to the most ideal future where Bitcoin and Ethereum fulfill their narrative. Bitcoin is a \"store of value\" and Ethereum is the backbone of most financial activities (\"tokenize the world\").\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kuwmeo/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2021/giyrc89/\n\n>Let's say 40 years from now. Ethereum has successfully tokenized the world. Everything that can be traded and it's derivatives are all able to be traded on Ethereum. EIP-1559 and proof of stake has resulted in a deflationary asset sought after to settle on layer 1. Everything links back to the backbone of the financial network, Ethereum. Meaning security will be a number 1 priority for every large scale party involved with the ethereum network. Large financial institutions, nation states, and companies, will need to hold Ethereum (either through custodians or personal wallets) on reserve to complete layer 1 transactions. \n\n\n>Bitcoin would have had 99+% of it supply mined by then, and would be relying on mining fees to pay for security. Only the largest of large transaction can be processed on layer 1. *Sidenote: relying only on mining fees is something that some researchers believe is not sustainable and will need to be debated due to it possibly affecting security.* \n\n>In this world what would bitcoin be offering that Ethereum couldn't do much better? The security of bitcoin would be an after thought in the tokenized world. Eth will be hoarded by nation states and corporations, so they can run validators and nodes i.e. have a say in the network.

And it&#39;s the reason I kind of like the comparison. Digital yield is hard to sell to the average person. Talking about interest rates already causes a glazed over look in people eyes. Digital Gold makes sense and Digital Oil also makes sense. I&#39;ll copy and paste some of my responses from yesterday&#39;s thread concerning my thought process.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kuwmeo/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2021/giy5laf/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kuwmeo/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2021/giy5laf/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was more thinking along the lines that almost everything in the world needs oil. Oil to heat homes, travel, electricity, manufacturing, etc. It is crucial in the most basic operations and functions of the economy. Where as Gold, while still has its manufacturing purposes, is less important.</p>\n\n<p>If Ethereum tokenized the world, it will be as crucial to the economic operations of the world as much as oil is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think you might be taking the digital oil comparison a little too literal. It&#39;s just an attempt to compare something digital to a physical commodity. Eth is also a lot more than digital yield. It&#39;s one aspect of what ETH offers. Bankless hosts likes to call it a triple point asset and the best evolution of money, I like that narrative a lot. </p>\n\n<p>Ethereum is the Internet of Money (IoM) :)</p>\n\n<p>I agree with you that digital oil might carry a lot of negative connotations but I think it also reinforces the idea of how crucial it is in the operation of open finance and the ethereum network.</p>\n\n<p>You also mention coexistence with bitcoin. Maybe for now. But In the extreme long term I don&#39;t see a reason why bitcoin needs to exist. I&#39;m certain it will still exist. It just becomes really, really, hard to justify bitcoins existence. You can say it&#39;s the longest running, most secure, crypto but there will come a point where ethereum earns that badge of long running and secure. And then what does bitcoin offer.l besides that. Let&#39;s travel to the most ideal future where Bitcoin and Ethereum fulfill their narrative. Bitcoin is a &quot;store of value&quot; and Ethereum is the backbone of most financial activities (&quot;tokenize the world&quot;).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kuwmeo/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2021/giyrc89/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kuwmeo/daily_general_discussion_january_11_2021/giyrc89/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let&#39;s say 40 years from now. Ethereum has successfully tokenized the world. Everything that can be traded and it&#39;s derivatives are all able to be traded on Ethereum. EIP-1559 and proof of stake has resulted in a deflationary asset sought after to settle on layer 1. Everything links back to the backbone of the financial network, Ethereum. Meaning security will be a number 1 priority for every large scale party involved with the ethereum network. Large financial institutions, nation states, and companies, will need to hold Ethereum (either through custodians or personal wallets) on reserve to complete layer 1 transactions. </p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin would have had 99+% of it supply mined by then, and would be relying on mining fees to pay for security. Only the largest of large transaction can be processed on layer 1. <em>Sidenote: relying only on mining fees is something that some researchers believe is not sustainable and will need to be debated due to it possibly affecting security.</em> </p>\n\n<p>In this world what would bitcoin be offering that Ethereum couldn&#39;t do much better? The security of bitcoin would be an after thought in the tokenized world. Eth will be hoarded by nation states and corporations, so they can run validators and nodes i.e. have a say in the network. Bitcoin will just be a Proof of Work chain that doesn&#39;t really need to be bought or held for any reason other than a store of value. But at this point it becomes clear that the world sees eth as the the store of value.</p>\n\n<p>We are already seeing Bitcoin being wrapped into wBTC, to leverage it in Open Finance transactions (DeFi) on ETH. If the world continues to tokenize assets on Ethereum, I can only assume a majority of bitcoin will be a tokenized asset, as it will be the pathway to the rest of the finance world. </p>\n\n<p>If ethereum acheives its vision, It just doesn&#39;t make sense in the long term for why bitcoin needs to exist as a separate proof of work network.

Here are some of the key points that stood out to me:\n\n>*Synthetix V3*  \nThis represents a complete re-architecture of the Synthetix contracts (the first time since late 2018) and provides an opportunity to rethink what's possible.\n\nThe significance of v3 can't be overstated. It will be a total overhaul of the architecture left over from the Havven days that will massively expand the scope of what's possible with the Synthetix protocol (everything below is part of v3)\n\n>*Siloed debt pools*  \nThe current debt pool is undifferentiated, which makes it hard to hedge across various asset classes.

Here are some of the key points that stood out to me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Synthetix V3</em><br/>\nThis represents a complete re-architecture of the Synthetix contracts (the first time since late 2018) and provides an opportunity to rethink what&#39;s possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The significance of v3 can&#39;t be overstated. It will be a total overhaul of the architecture left over from the Havven days that will massively expand the scope of what&#39;s possible with the Synthetix protocol (everything below is part of v3)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Siloed debt pools</em><br/>\nThe current debt pool is undifferentiated, which makes it hard to hedge across various asset classes. By splitting the debt pools into discrete asset classes stakers would be able to choose which pool to participate in and the market would adjust the yield within each pool accordingly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been talking about this possibility for a while, seeing Kain say it is extremely exciting.
