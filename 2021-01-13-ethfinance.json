EIP-1559 <-- obviously mega bullish, negative issuance meme, world's best SOV and programmable asset also reducing supply. We cannot fathom how these factors will come together\n2. Layer 2 implementation, specifically Synthetix on Optimism. Stani from AAVE responded to Mark Cuban today on Twitter (new paradigm or what?) confirming L2 shortly. One of Aave's best twitter follows Lemiscate hinted at Optimism as well. It also looks possible that Uniswap V3 will be on Optimism. This could create some juicy layer 2 cross-compatibility of our already composable money legos. It's really happening ladies & gents, and soon us small time investors will be able to stake affordably thanks to reduced gas costs!\n3. Aave inevitably going to bust a nut on the crypto community by dropping some big integration with a financial institution somewhere in EU. Just speculation on my part but I think this is sooner than most realise and on the horizon in 2021\n4. ETH All time high. It's an inevitability. ETH will melt faces (thanks Kaiynne). We got a taste of what it can do when it moves just recently. We have just begun. Where to from ATH? Fuck knows. I don't know when or if to sell as it goes up. Thinking if I get to a place of having 4-5x a house deposit I will cash out enough to get my first place.\n5. NFTs taking off. Feels like this movement is just beginning. Right now there are probably some *insane* aysmmetric upside opporunities if you can do some deep fundamental research and pick the AAVE/SNX/COMP/MKR of NFTs. I don't really have an opinion on this space other than that I should probably get an opinion\n6. Building more relationships with fellow ethereans and Defi dudes and dudettes. I am keen to meet and speak with you all. If any of you people reading this are looking for more people to share your passion with, feeling lonely at all, or just wanting to expand your network online with like-minded people, reach out to me!\n\nLove to all my ETHFinance friends and family.

The context for this is Optimism going live with rollups on Synthetix this week and Connext now live as well.

But that is going to take quite a long time. Expect some of the ZK rollups teams to come up with impressive demos in the first half of the year where they say \"look, we compiled a big solidity contract into our ZK language and it's fast!\". However, this is still quite far from any kind of mainnet release of an EVM-capable ZK rollup. EVM optimistic rollups have the massive advantage that they can largely just piggyback off of the EVM for fraud proof execution, whereas in a ZK rollup you need to write up the prover and verifier in a complicated circuit language, do a whole bunch of custom optimizations, verify that your custom optimizations work, etc etc. I personally would not feel comfortable putting my life savings into an EVM-capable ZK rollup for years, whereas an optimistic EVM rollup is a much easier sell, because the code needed to execute fraud proofs is not that complicated.\n\nThat said, I have been strongly recommending the Optimism team to be proactive and start coming up with a strategy today toward eventually becoming a ZK EVM rollup. They have lots of time, and lots of resources, but it's still worth getting started on this early.\"","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Vitalik posted this to the Optimism discord today which I found interesting.

But if the scaling ability that seems to be spoken about is true, even a huge migration of users might not be able to offset just how impressive the fee drop really is.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t used Loopring personally, but everyone here makes it sound like trades are in the realm of like a penny a trade. Or even less. So hypothetically speaking if we can turn a $10 trade without rollups to a $.01 trade with rollups, volume / userbase  would need to increase 1000x to get back to that fee level. Which I know crypto booms but I don&#39;t see that happening even in the next year.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, I think we can see the potential for a feed-back loop occurring in the global system. Say UNI, Tether, and others all start to use L2 solutions and the gas price goes down. Maybe instead of the 50 to 200 range, it drops to the 25 to 100 range. So not only is Synthetix&#39;s fee cheaper due to the mechanics of an OR, but the times the OR actually needs to communicate with the main chain its cheaper too. Which I assume(?) will pass the savings down to the user - i.e. maybe now its $.005 a trade?</p>\n\n<p>Again, that&#39;s my na\u00efve understanding of it all. Happy to be corrected.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-13 06:29:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gj452fs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kwaesu","parent_id":"t1_gj42fdw","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Coldsnap","body":"I'm sure Synthetix themselves will be posting on any and all fee improvements as well :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m sure Synthetix themselves will be posting on any and all fee improvements as well :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-13 06:36:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gj45t9p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kwaesu","parent_id":"t1_gj452fs","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"I hope.
