It was my understanding that $basefee would rebalance to more-or-less the slowest still included transactions and everything above is the miner tip?\n\nSorry I don't have a source, just my own independent research. You are correct in that base fee dynamically adjusts to the slowest txn included in the previous block. But if you inspect transactions in some of the most congested blocks, you see that the top few transactions (in gas price) are paying the bulk of the fees. \n\nFor instance, when volatility is high like we saw earlier today, you can expect blocks with an average gas price of 500-600 Gwei. This figure is significantly skewed by expensive arbitrage transactions that will go as high as they have to as long as the txn is still profitable, but with a handfull of 90-100 Gwei txns the average comes to ~500 Gwei. In a block like that, only ~5-10% of the fees paid would actually be burned in the current proposed mechanism. And that's assuming miners don't play games with the txns they choose to include to maximize revenue. At the end of the day, we can only reasonably expect miners to do what is most profitable for them. So if they have to include a few cheap txns in a block so that less of the net fees are burned, I would expect them to do it. Then we are essentially wasting time and resources playing a game of whack-a-mole with miners. \n\nAlso sorry, I misspoke before. It's not 5% of the fees being burned. It's that introducing the fee burn mechanism would only amount to a ~5% (or 10% perhaps) reduction in issuance. So reducing inflation from 4.4% to 4% at best. \n\nTL;DR - PoS is the only thing that will bring down inflation.
