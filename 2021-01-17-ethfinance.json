People want to put their capital to work so as long as they trust WBTC mechanism, this number is expeceted to go up (assuming Ethereum usage keeps growing).\n\nIt could get to a point where a huge % of BTC supply is locked in Ethereum. In addition, the new gold 2.0 narrative makes people treat BTC as it, not using it for transactions. As long as issuance rate for block production is relatively high + BTC price is high, miners in PoW are happy to work in order to get the issued BTCs even if (hypothetically) there are close to 0 fees.\n\nWhat happens when issuance rate decreases? BTC is forced to keep appreciating ad eternum in order for the miners to keep working for the new tiny amount of BTC. So basically in this scenario BTC PoW current model will only be stable as BTC keeps appreciating. So it is like a circular argument \"BTC keeps appreciating respect to FIAT (or the currency you use to pay for electricity) because if it does not, BTC PoW mechanism will not work anymore\". (Even if FED starts making FIAT money harder, the circular argument must apply to maintain the BTC model). The problem with these circular arguments is that they work until they don't and the spiral of death begins.

People want to put their capital to work so as long as they trust WBTC mechanism, this number is expeceted to go up (assuming Ethereum usage keeps growing).</p>\n\n<p>It could get to a point where a huge % of BTC supply is locked in Ethereum. In addition, the new gold 2.0 narrative makes people treat BTC as it, not using it for transactions. As long as issuance rate for block production is relatively high + BTC price is high, miners in PoW are happy to work in order to get the issued BTCs even if (hypothetically) there are close to 0 fees.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when issuance rate decreases? BTC is forced to keep appreciating ad eternum in order for the miners to keep working for the new tiny amount of BTC. So basically in this scenario BTC PoW current model will only be stable as BTC keeps appreciating. So it is like a circular argument &quot;BTC keeps appreciating respect to FIAT (or the currency you use to pay for electricity) because if it does not, BTC PoW mechanism will not work anymore&quot;.

Both of these indexes have PowerPool's native CVP token in them which may be a turnoff for some. Soon they will be launching the ASSY index (Aave, Syntheix, Sushi, and YFI), which will allow you to earn additional yield without holding CVP.\n\nDPI is a solid index, but currently the best staking yield is only ~40% APY through SushiSwap.

My cost basis for the recent MKR purchases I made was about 506. At the time it was set to outperform ETH. Now up at $1500 I&#39;m less confident of that.</p>\n\n<p>RPL still looks reasonably valid if you buy into the speculative assumptions I made.</p>\n\n<p>KNC isn&#39;t that bad from a PE perspective yet but I don&#39;t see it having momentum that ETH does at the moment so it&#39;ll probably lose on the ratio in the short term.</p>\n\n<p>REN isn&#39;t bad on a PE front and has a bit more momentum. My position in that is small. I should probably take another look at it soon.</p>\n\n<p>NEXO is below it&#39;s rational value at the moment. With an AUM of 4B it should have a market cap of at least 400M. Probably closer to 500M.</p>\n\n<p>Bancor has a decent PE. It&#39;s an underappreciated/undiscussed coin around here.</p>\n\n<p>For all of these make sure you understand what you are buying and why it should appreciate in value.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-17 14:28:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gjnnxld","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kz0s7a","parent_id":"t1_gjnk3sh","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProfessionalNoiseX","body":"Thanks for your insight!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for your insight!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-17 14:35:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gjnowaa","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kz0s7a","parent_id":"t1_gjnnxld","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/diggler__d","body":"What do you guys think about Navcoin?
