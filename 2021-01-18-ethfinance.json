But I'm a postdoc with a maths background who has ended up working in formal semantics of natural language. This has connections with the semantics of functional programming languages -- type theory and category theory. So I am well-acquainted with the academic work of some people working on aspects of Cardano, especially ones who contribute(d) a lot to the development of Haskell (Philip Wadler, for one).\n\nWhether or not Haskell has set the world of programming alight is debatable -- certainly, aspects of functional programming methods have filtered into the mainstream via Haskell. But certainly, the language is not widely used.\n\nRelated ideas -- dependent types and correct-by-construction programs -- remain very much at the academic level. \n\nThat's kind of my feeling about the Cardano research. It's dealing with interesting formal, mathematical questions and problems. But when it comes to say, making sure that smart contracts are bug-free, the formal tools are not a silver bullet.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that topics like formal verification have been discussed in the Ethereum space for *years*.

But I&#39;m a postdoc with a maths background who has ended up working in formal semantics of natural language. This has connections with the semantics of functional programming languages -- type theory and category theory. So I am well-acquainted with the academic work of some people working on aspects of Cardano, especially ones who contribute(d) a lot to the development of Haskell (Philip Wadler, for one).</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not Haskell has set the world of programming alight is debatable -- certainly, aspects of functional programming methods have filtered into the mainstream via Haskell. But certainly, the language is not widely used.</p>\n\n<p>Related ideas -- dependent types and correct-by-construction programs -- remain very much at the academic level. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s kind of my feeling about the Cardano research.
