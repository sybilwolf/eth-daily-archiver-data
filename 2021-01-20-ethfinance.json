I somehow picked the 20th of every month, cause ETH will go to... 10k :)\n\n1. I / we all should get in touch with different defi projects even if you dont really use them. i have a business, but not a finance background. i have some stocks (apart from crypto obv) but I never shorted, leveraged, borrowed, lend etc. because why would I? and why would i borrow to then use this to put it somewhere else... you know the strategies. i have spend some money to use defi protocols and think this is a great investment, even if there was no financial gain. this last month I checked loopring and how it works. to understand layer 2 is crucial imo. \n2. a second project I thought about giving a try is curve (because I do have some stETH from trying liquid staking). curve is a great example why crypto UX still needs to improve to gain mainstream attention and later on usage. curve looks like 90s. compared to e.g. uni... OMG. and curve is rather successful. good thing is, I think they actually do wanna improve the page. best choice imo.  \n3. we live in a crypto bubble. we are really early. always remember that. one example: there is always this argument that owning crypto (by e.g. taking it off exchanges) is so hard. whenever I hear this,  think thats bull. but this week I remembered how scared I was when I created my first wallet with metamask. I had no idea how all this works and only moved like 0.3 ETH to the wallet in case I fucked up. \n4. defi tokens will be the big winners of this cycle. alt coins from the previous cycle will have its time and gains, some new projects will also blow up, but I dont think those will perform as good as defi protocols. since ETH = defi right now I think that this will also be ETH cycle. but: i am not a ETH maxi. there will be more chains and other use cases that wont perfectly fit into ETH. \n5. i believe we wont see 5+ 30% crashes during this bull market. i made this prediction several times before and it seems to be right. there will be consolidation, but the market and its investors have matured. a \"huge\" crash will more likely be 20-25%. the first crash we saw fits this pattern. thus if you wanna sell to buy in at a lower stage (and I never did this nor will I do this in the future), just to wait too long. I also believe the bear market wont be a 80-90% correction this time. \n6. take profits. make a plan now and stick to it. I have a stack I plan to hodl, but have made a plan to exit a %. the first sell will be to recover my investment, the second sell is pure profits and ill use this stack to rebuy in case of a bear market. I still dont believe we will necessarily repeat the 4 year cycle and that selling in DEC 21 and rebuying automatically in summer 2023 will be a great decision. but if history rhymes, ill be there. if it doesnt, i took profits. \n\nlooking forward to your comments. or see you on feb 20th :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To clarify my own thoughts (and later on act based on that...)

But really though, take a look at the used market for 5 year old Teslas, or worse, some other brands that were considered very cool at the time (cough, Fisker), and it&#39;s really sad how dated they look and how much they underperform compared to current gen models. Or just how straight up imcomtaible they are with current OS updates or self-driving features. They just can&#39;t be retrofitted. They&#39;re defunct in less than a decade. It will become less and less of a problem as the evolution slows, but right now they are stuck strictly within the realm of expensive luxuries in my mind.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-20 10:52:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gjz24gx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l1340q","parent_id":"t1_gjz0abn","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/communist_mini_pesto","body":"https://www.google.com/amp/s/thedriven.io/2020/02/10/tesla-model-3-top-list-of-cars-that-hold-their-value/amp/\n\nBut so far Teslas have had better resale value than any other car on the market","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/thedriven.io/2020/02/10/tesla-model-3-top-list-of-cars-that-hold-their-value/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/thedriven.io/2020/02/10/tesla-model-3-top-list-of-cars-that-hold-their-value/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p>But so far Teslas have had better resale value than any other car on the market</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-20 13:37:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gjzon6m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l1340q","parent_id":"t1_gjyyc9y","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/DoctorNoisewaterr","body":"Fair point!

My guess is that this cycle will end with a blow off top above $10k that will take us somewhere into the $15-20k range. I&#39;m currently looking at selling 40% around $17k and saving the rest to earn interest via staking/DeFi/BlockFi or whatever. If that target doesn&#39;t hit, I will probably just accept &quot;defeat&quot; and sell 20-40% hopefully between $8-10k.</p>\n\n<p>inb4: </p>\n\n<p>&quot;You should DCA your sells. What if $17k doesn&#39;t hit?&quot; - Yes, I know. Everyone has their own risk appetite and people should make their own decisions.
