My body was aching, slight fever, and runny nose on the plane. In addition, I suspect the warm weather, mosquitos, and staying on the beach drinking too much that caused it, especially a change from cold winter I was coming from. It felt like a normal cold/flu and I slept for like 12 hours for a couple days upon arriving back in the states. Furthermore, I healed up and felt amazing then I got sick again later during a polar vortex in late January/early February of 2019. \n\nThis is where I started to panic and was in & out of urgent care on a weekly basis getting antibiotics. The fever, coughing mucus/phlegm out, and difficulty breathing was back. I eventually went to my primary health care provider to see what was wrong (before my trip I took the usual anti malaria drugs and other stuff before traveling to a third world country as my doctor recommended). Moreover, they ran so many tests to see if I contracted anything in Thailand. For example, blood tests and x-rays of my lungs. Everything check out my lungs were fine just a mild lung infection and blood work came back normal. My doctor just gave anitbitiotcs and a steroid inhaler to bring inflammation down in my lungs. In addition, my doctor suspected it was not from traveling overseas as the symptoms/problems would have persisted still upon arriving back from my trip instead of happening a month later. \n\nThe symptoms subside a little with fever gone and no coughing unless to drain the mucus/phlegm from my lungs. Everyday I would wake up in the morning and go straight to the bathroom to cough up blotched, yellow, and thick mucus from my lungs. This happened for weeks still. Therefore, I went back to my doctor to see if this will ever go away and they said yeah... ok great more antibiotics and oral antiinflammation drugs (Predisone). The symptoms persisted and lasted for months and now blood is mixing in with the mucus in the morning. Now I'm at full panic mode and end up in the ER telling the doc that there is blood in my mucus that I have had a lung infection for a month now. Furthermore, I get a CAT scan of my lungs/upper respiratory area to see if anything major is wrong. The results come out fine and the tiny amount of blood mixed in my mucus was from my throat being so irritated from cough out the phlegm every day/morning. At this point I'm having so much stress and anxiety from not being able to recover from this and honestly think I'm dying. The amount of sleep I'm getting is 3-4 hours a day at best and waking up drenched in sweat from nightmares. I was in hell for months. It did not help I lost my appetite a lot from the antibiotics and lost a solid 15-20lbs.  \n\nMy primary health care provider was at a loss to what was going on. For the most part I was healthy and perfectly fine except for the difficulty breathing and lungs having filled with phlegm and having to cough it up every morning. Doc recommend I go see a lung specialist and go through testing. Asthmas tests, lung capacity tests, and so many more testing to see if my lungs are healthy. The results come back and they're perfectly fine. The pulmonologist says my lungs are fine and sometimes after a severe lung infection it may take a couple weeks to months for the lungs to filter, clean itself, and drain the mucus/phlegm out. I instantly felt at ease. \n\nThis whole thing went from January to August and the mucus/phlegm start to slowly subside and eventually go away altogether. On the contrary, it's taken a heavy toll on me mentally from taking all these antibiotics, steroid inhalers (one possible side effect was depression), antinflmamorty drugs. The stress and anxiety destroyed my mental heath and lead to stomach problems like acid reflux that landed me in the ER as well during this process. The anitbitiotcs destroyed my natural healthy gut flora and that plays an important role in mental health. I truly believe there is a strong connection with the mind and gut. Ok great now i am healed physically but this process has taken its toll. The stressing about not being able to recover and thinking I'm dying led me to anxiety. \n\n\nMy mind would never shut off even at night not being able to sleep and \"reset\" everything. At this point I am anxiety ridden and depressed. I go back to my doctor and explain what I'm feeling. I get prescribed antidepressants (Zoloft/Setraline). I took it for a couple months during May-July and it did work for a little to get my hormones back in balanced but I ultimately didn't like the sedating effects that made me feel like a zombie and hair loss. Altogether, I ultimately stopped taking it and wanted to do it the natural way by working out, eating right, and breaking these self destructing habits I learned. Moreover, I started to feel better but my mental health has been up and down throughout 2019-2020. I am getting better every day and striving to be back to my normal self again. It's a daily challenge and I have bad days and even weeks to months but consistency is key to breaking the bad habits. The negative self talk, the hopelessness, and despair of the situation not improving has to stop. Told my self enough is enough and try to build a healthy routing of working out, eating right, meditation to soothe my thoughts, and my best to get a good night sleep (the most difficult). Breaking the viscous cycle of stress, anxiety, and depression is extremely hard and taking it step by step is what I'm after. I am 100% physically healthy but mentally at like 50% and hoping to gain that extra 50% back as soon as possible to start living life again!\n\nI hope you are doing well and would love to hear your story as well if you don't mind!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I traveled overseas to Thailand for vacation and got a little sick upon returning on the flight home.

They all got their own distinct flavor of airdrops in 2020, and each participated in DeFi protocols at least to some degree.\n\n2019 taxes had defi and it was a manual affair, but it wasn't too brutal.  But due to the liquidity mining wars of 2020, this year I had a couple hundred logical transactions, but  between approvals and airdrops etc, over five hundred actual transactions, largely DeFi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bitcoin.tax](https://Bitcoin.tax) \\- what I have used to date.  The best way I have found to handle this in bitcoin.tax is to import a [zerion.io](https://zerion.io) csv export for each address.  It imports trade transactions fairly well, but income is an entirely manual affair.  Claiming liquidity mining rewards, interest on lending protocols, airdrops, etc - it didn't recognize any of that.  What you end up with is a bunch of intermediary tokens showing up with zero cost basis - if you want to properly account for income you have to manually input and untangle the transaction history for the dates the gains were realized.  I have airdrops in, but I stopped at the liquidity mining rewards and interest.  Might get back to finishing this data entry as a control, I mean hell I already paid for 2020 early in 2019 anyway.\n\n[Tokentax.co](https://Tokentax.co) \\- after I first encountered the alphabet soup above, I tried what zerion was recommending, tokentax.  At first I tried the zerion integration by uploading csv's from zerion.  That didn't work very well for some oddball transactions like gitcoin zksync transactions.  After fiddling a bit I found you can just point it at specific ethereum addresses and let it do the import for you.  Worked like a charm.  I think.  I haven't had to tag anything, or delete any transactions, nothing.  What it is missing though is a closing position report.  I can't really verify it has the right info if I can't see what it thinks my 2020 closing position is.  So although it was super low friction, I have trust issues (don't we all here?).  Regardless I paid for this service for 2020 also, so I am going to be using it.\n\n[Koin.ly](https://Koin.ly) \\- I head a few users here sing the praises of Koinly, so I decided to give it a whirl.  The site is modern and clean.  Well the transaction ledger is a bit pudgy and you can only fit 2 or 3 transactions on a screen in the list view, but that is tolerable enough.  What is different about the experience vs tokentax is that there isn't as much 'smarts' regarding all of the transactions.  I had to tag all of the airdrop transactions manually, all of the liquidity mining, and interest, etc.  But the interface for doing so is pretty straightforward and easy to use.  This is kind of like a modern bitcoin.tax experience. The current position /dashboard report agrees with zerion and zapper.  \u00a0\ud83d\udc4d\n\nUnfortunately koinly only lets me see the summary level info of the 2020 tax liability.  The numbers differ significantly from tokentax, and of course way different to bitcoin.tax owing to the fact I haven't finished the tedious transaction accounting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Rotki.com](https://Rotki.com) or [https://github.com/rotki/rotki](https://github.com/rotki/rotki) \\- I couldn't find the daily where somebody had mentioned a bunch of crypto profile / tax accounting open source software, but I did find rotki and a couple lesser other projects on github.  Rotki is a fully different paradigm.  It is not a cloud platform.  Your data is stored encrypted locally on your own machine.  Of course this is appealing.\n\nThere is a brew cask for rotki so it was super easy to try.  About 90 minutes later I have all my exchange data sync'd, eth wallets imported, and balances reporting accurately.  It was very smooth and easy.  Some of the docs are slightly out of date and appear to reference the UI of prior versions, but it is pretty well documented.  The \"tax report\" function appears to now be \"profit and loss report\".  And you can generate it for any year or quarter.  There are specific defi plugins, and even protocols for which there is not a plugin, it correctly identifies the contract and transaction type.  I encountered a few errors here and there like, for example, errors about not being able to get price data for Dai on certain days.  The report generation is slow, even when you point it to a local eth1 node.  For grins, and to support open source software, I bought a premium subscription for 1 month to see what it has to offer.  TBH, I didn't find anything compelling.  The \"statistics\" tab is blank and shows no data, no new reports were unlocked, and the 'eth2 staking' module pretty much just tells me what my eth2 staking balance is, sorta meh.  That said, it is a good tool which appears to be under active development.  I intend to continue to use it for self-sovereign portfolio tracking.  The bad news is that the tax reporting gives me a 4th distinct tax liability report.\n\n# TL/DR:\n\nAcross these four accounting tools, between tokentax, koinly, and rotki I see a **variance of \\~5%**.  Given the heavy lifting necessary to account for cost basis of intermediate tokens in bitcoin.tax it shows about **5x** the tax liability of the other three tools.\n\nMy goal is to get all three of these tools to converge to the same number, and if I am feeling froggy, get bitcoin.tax to agree.  \n\n\nedit: updated tokentax ref thanks /u/shiftli","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Figured I would share some thoughts on my 2020 US tax accounting through DeFi land in hopes that it will help others.</p>\n\n<p>I use a few addresses, kinda like &#39;tiered&#39; wallets: cold, hot, and plasma.  They all got their own distinct flavor of airdrops in 2020, and each participated in DeFi protocols at least to some degree.</p>\n\n<p>2019 taxes had defi and it was a manual affair, but it wasn&#39;t too brutal.  But due to the liquidity mining wars of 2020, this year I had a couple hundred logical transactions, but  between approvals and airdrops etc, over five hundred actual transactions, largely DeFi.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://Bitcoin.tax\">Bitcoin.tax</a> - what I have used to date.  The best way I have found to handle this in bitcoin.tax is to import a <a href=\"https://zerion.io\">zerion.io</a> csv export for each address.  It imports trade transactions fairly well, but income is an entirely manual affair.  Claiming liquidity mining rewards, interest on lending protocols, airdrops, etc - it didn&#39;t recognize any of that.  What you end up with is a bunch of intermediary tokens showing up with zero cost basis - if you want to properly account for income you have to manually input and untangle the transaction history for the dates the gains were realized.  I have airdrops in, but I stopped at the liquidity mining rewards and interest.  Might get back to finishing this data entry as a control, I mean hell I already paid for 2020 early in 2019 anyway.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://Tokentax.co\">Tokentax.co</a> - after I first encountered the alphabet soup above, I tried what zerion was recommending, tokentax.  At first I tried the zerion integration by uploading csv&#39;s from zerion.  That didn&#39;t work very well for some oddball transactions like gitcoin zksync transactions.  After fiddling a bit I found you can just point it at specific ethereum addresses and let it do the import for you.  Worked like a charm.  I think.  I haven&#39;t had to tag anything, or delete any transactions, nothing.  What it is missing though is a closing position report.  I can&#39;t really verify it has the right info if I can&#39;t see what it thinks my 2020 closing position is.  So although it was super low friction, I have trust issues (don&#39;t we all here?).  Regardless I paid for this service for 2020 also, so I am going to be using it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://Koin.ly\">Koin.ly</a> - I head a few users here sing the praises of Koinly, so I decided to give it a whirl.  The site is modern and clean.  Well the transaction ledger is a bit pudgy and you can only fit 2 or 3 transactions on a screen in the list view, but that is tolerable enough.  What is different about the experience vs tokentax is that there isn&#39;t as much &#39;smarts&#39; regarding all of the transactions.  I had to tag all of the airdrop transactions manually, all of the liquidity mining, and interest, etc.  But the interface for doing so is pretty straightforward and easy to use.  This is kind of like a modern bitcoin.tax experience. The current position /dashboard report agrees with zerion and zapper.  \u00a0\ud83d\udc4d</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately koinly only lets me see the summary level info of the 2020 tax liability.  The numbers differ significantly from tokentax, and of course way different to bitcoin.tax owing to the fact I haven&#39;t finished the tedious transaction accounting.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://Rotki.com\">Rotki.com</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/rotki/rotki\">https://github.com/rotki/rotki</a> - I couldn&#39;t find the daily where somebody had mentioned a bunch of crypto profile / tax accounting open source software, but I did find rotki and a couple lesser other projects on github.  Rotki is a fully different paradigm.  It is not a cloud platform.  Your data is stored encrypted locally on your own machine.  Of course this is appealing.</p>\n\n<p>There is a brew cask for rotki so it was super easy to try.  About 90 minutes later I have all my exchange data sync&#39;d, eth wallets imported, and balances reporting accurately.  It was very smooth and easy.  Some of the docs are slightly out of date and appear to reference the UI of prior versions, but it is pretty well documented.

I got no problem with that, ADA and DOT are cool, but I was trying to explain to him that these are smart-contract platforms in competition with Ethereum and most of the next-gen financial awesomeness is actually already happening but on Ethereum.

He was helping me work on one of my properties, and I offered to pay him in ETH instead of USD.  I set aside 2 ETH in a new wallet, when the price was around $175.  He started researching things on his own, and was soon playing with Argent and Metamask.  After the crash in March, he wanted to accumulate, so he bought 4+ ETH at an average of $188.  As we kept talking crypto, he decided I was his ticket to success, and insisted on sending me some DAI to trade with.  (Regulatory compliance interlude: the assets he sent were a gift without obligation, and anything I send the other way is likewise a gift, honestly accounted for tax purposes; I'm in no way acting as a financial professional, just being nice to someone I care about.  Now back to my inspiring anecdote...)  \n\nAs I've written before, I actively trade small amounts to avoid boredom, with 99% of my crypto committed to long-term strategies (I hate paying STCG tax, and I try to minimize stress).  I used my small DAI windfall to open spot positions as opportunities came along: COMP, ETH, RPL, MKR, LINK, UNI, OMG, BAT, ALGO, SNX, and XRP (please don't judge; I made 70% on that one in a month).  I came out way ahead on some, made a bit on others, and lost 1.5% on OMG.  Counting only realized profit, the DAI amount is now 2.5x what I was gifted.  Sure, in retrospect those gains could have been far more, but there's a difference between having DAI in hand and being fully exposed to market volatility; given my goal for the trading, I'm very happy with the results.  When we dipped below $1000 recently, I used that DAI to buy some ETH at $976.  I took a little profit at $1209 on the bounce, with 90% of the position still open.  If we continue going up, I'll scale out of that, aiming to turn the 2.5x into 4x.  \n\nWhat's my purpose in sharing this?  First, it feels great to help someone I consider part of my family, while bringing new blood into the Ethereum community.  His initial investment of $1177 in ETH is now worth $8500, and the DAI he gifted me is on track to continue growing quickly.  If ETH goes where most of us anticipate, Ethereum will meaningfully change his life for the better, and has already been a bright spot in dark times.  \n\nSecond, I want to gently encourage people to get others involved.  Over the last three years, I've onboarded several folks who have benefited greatly from listening to me and being patient.  It goes without saying that one must take care in such circumstances, emphasizing the potential dangers and the need for personal responsibility.  My SO has made almost 10x with my help, and two other good friends have made even more, not including the one discussed above.  I don't try to sell them on crypto as an investment; I convince them that Ethereum is a better way of doing things going forward, and that value appreciation is a likely long-term consequence of its growth.  \n\nI had a good life before I discovered Ethereum.  Years later, I have an amazing life.  I feel like I found a cheat code to make my worries disappear, and I'm tremendously grateful.

We&#39;ll both correct ~50\u201070% but only ethereum will have a strong recovery and a short bear market, supported by a continuing evolving defi and art/gaming ecosystem. Bitcoin will pretty much sputter out, eventually being flipped by LINK, DOT, and ADA. Eth is gonna steal btc&#39;s use case, what is it gonna do to survive? </p>\n\n<p>Evolve or die. </p>\n\n<p>I own some bitcoin, but it took about 3 months before I learned about ethereum and flipped my portfolio.

Just to cover my bases, I'm going to go ahead and try to justify a few of the lines. If I still don't answer your question, I'd be happy to try again if you could clarify.\n\n**#1 \u2014 Diagonal**\n\nThe trend line I specifically wrote this comment about, the diagonal, has way more than two touches. I\"m counting \\~10. Some of those aren't *exact* touches, but on this scale (2w), I wouldn't necessarily expect them all to be exact. Normally in a situation like this I would use a small channel/zone, but I didn't think it was a huge deal.\n\nSo what does this line *literally mean*? It's simply a support/resistance (S/R) line, like any other S/R line. Sure, you typically see horizontals, but if you consider larger formations like pennants, wedges, flags, etc., you can see that sloped lines of S/R definitely do exist. So, I suppose a line like this just gives us a solid point of reference for where we might expect to find S/R zones, which is very useful for people that are day trading.\n\n(*EDIT:* Also, if you see [this chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ttMneAnn/) from my original post yesterday, you can see that this diagonal was on there, and this in itself proves it's usefulness, since we can see from today that it correctly provided an S/R projection).\n\n**#2 \u2014 Target Zones**\n\nI will admit, The two lines running across the top seem to be pretty random. If it was one of these two lines that you were referring to, you might want to refer to my post from yesterday, [the original which can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ko4o2v/altcoin_discussion_friday_january_01_2021/gkexii0/). Perhaps I should have referenced this. I guess I supposed that most people would have at least seen it yesterday, since it seemed to get a lot of attention on a few different subs, including this one. So that's my fault. I'll go back and edit it.\n\nAnyway, those two lines are our target lines from the IHS and C&H formations. They are not S/R lines. They're just representing the zone where we expect the price to reach given the analysis above. (*EDIT:* For the sake of clarity, both of these lines were derived from the formulas in the referenced post, just in case that wasn't clear.)\n\n**#3 \u2014 The Middle**\n\nI believe both of these lines are from yesterday as well. They're also S/R lines to some extent, although less important at this point. One of the two lines was, I believe, the line we needed to cross in order to invoke our formations detailed yesterday. We crossed both of them, so whichever one is the original is likely a pretty important S/R line (I believe at 0.0406).\n\n\nI hope this answers your question, but if not, like I said, I'd be happy to discuss anything in further detail.\n\n(*EDIT*: a few misspellings/formatting)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I don&#39;t know if you really just aren&#39;t familiar with some of these concepts and your wording is coming off wrong, or if you&#39;re just being purposely derisive, but perhaps you could chill on the tone a bit?</p>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question, I&#39;m not really sure what line you&#39;re talking about, since there&#39;s definitely more than a few on these charts (and not to mention, several charts). Just to cover my bases, I&#39;m going to go ahead and try to justify a few of the lines. If I still don&#39;t answer your question, I&#39;d be happy to try again if you could clarify.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#1 \u2014 Diagonal</strong></p>\n\n<p>The trend line I specifically wrote this comment about, the diagonal, has way more than two touches. I&quot;m counting ~10. Some of those aren&#39;t <em>exact</em> touches, but on this scale (2w), I wouldn&#39;t necessarily expect them all to be exact. Normally in a situation like this I would use a small channel/zone, but I didn&#39;t think it was a huge deal.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this line <em>literally mean</em>?

Everything else is predicated on this. </li>\n<li>Only buy, never sell (unless you have the opportunity for a moon mission)\n\n<ul>\n<li>DCA or try to time the dips with TA if you want some excitement.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Have a plan for when you would sell. For me these are not percentages at certain prices, but rather opportunities to add value to my life. I call them <strong>moon missions</strong> Buying our next (dream) house and buying/investing in the company I work for are the two moon missions I have acknowledged so far.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I want to elaborate a bit more on <strong>moon missions</strong>. Once again these aren&#39;t price points, they are <em>life opportunities coupled with price points</em>. The opportunity has to be there and the price needs to be there. If these two things never align, then I keep holding. </p>\n\n<p>Worst case scenario it all goes to zero and I am ok with this. In the best case scenario I end up with a large amount of liquid capital that I can deploy on future moon missions I haven&#39;t even dreamt of yet.</p>\n\n<p>While I am here, this is also why I have not yet pulled the trigger on staking. Staking is exciting to me, but the lock-up period is sacrificing a lot of optionality which is important for my moon mission model.</p>\n\n<p>This is how I do it.

Over time, will a private chain that\u2019s bridged to Ethereum be the standard, or will those applications end up porting over and just be issued on Ethereum once eth2 or something like ORs are here, or will they choose to continue their current set up on a private chain, necessitating the need for a bridge? I think one factor that contributes to the answer is whether there is a business reason that\u2019ll persist into the future for a company to do something similar, where minting and selling those collectibles are done a private chain as opposed to on the eth2 base layer or on a L2 like ORs. In the case of Top Shots, there\u2019s a market driven demand to have those assets transferred to a place where they can be sold in a liquid manner, used as collateral in DeFi, etc., such that there is a benefit and need for connecting the assets to public open chains like Ethereum.\n\nIn terms of what kind of bridges will be adopted/used, I think that depends on what kind of value transfers the bridge can support and enable. Something like Connext and Thorchain are two cross-chain solutions that are rolling out on mainnet now or in the very near future, and are focusing simply on that one use case (being a bridge without the support of smart contracts). Connext being a L1-L2 and L2-L2 bridge. Thorchain I believe is being built on Cosmos, and will support similar functionality for transfers like Bitcoin to Ethereum. I know that there are Polkadot-based bridges being built that aim to connect Ethereum and its L2s to Polkadot, which can then act as a central hub to other chains, but that\u2019s where I still see an outstanding question that\u2019s currently unanswered by the market.

If the market sees benefit in one solution or the other, they will use it.\n\nMy views on this are based on utility and need. So, if we are talking about cross-chain between Bitcoin and Ethereum, I see that need. Is there a need to bridge private chains to public chains? Yes, at least at present (even for use cases for businesses built on private chains like Hyperledger Besu to Ethereum). Will there be a need to bridge open smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Polkadot? Maybe.

This means that your gains will be taxed at capital gains rate of 0, 15, and 20%  instead of normal earnings income tax rate.

I have spent the last week trying to to engage with people in r/BitcoinMarkets in the same way that I used to\u2014engaging in discussion to try and move our joint understanding forward\u2014and they just don't seem very interested in doing that for some reason. So it genuinely feels fantastic to enter a brand new community and already have so many people taking the time to reach out; perhaps this really is where I belong now.\n\n> Anyway, I can't get to sleep, so I'm going to go ahead and try to address u/i-love-the-pink-one concerns about higher timeframes. For tonight, I'm only going to look at a couple from the 1d and leave the rest for discussion in the morning. \n\n> Two things I would like to note, the first of which is, for the past few years *most* of my analysis work has been within the confines of BTC since I was mostly frequenting r/BitcoinMarkets, as I mentioned. So for some things, it may take me a bit to get caught up on specific intricacies. The second being\u2014don't get *too* caught up in indicators in the middle of ATH-breaking bull markets. While they're certainly by no means useless, more often than not a strong trend will trump what would normally be a strong signal.\n\n> So first let's look at the RSI. Yes, [while there is a bearish divergence](https://www.tradingview.com/x/g0Q9Hman/), if you look at the 12h I would argue that it already played out on the drop from $1400 => $1040. [Additionally, you have a hidden bullish divergence on the 12h as well.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kS2rzzyt/) \n\n> So the RSI and the over/undersold indicators really don't bother me much right now, especially since we have plenty of room/time to see where this move goes as it hopefully continues up, and if it does, you have a lot of upward space due to that hidden div.\n\n> In the same way, the MACD could, I suppose, be potentially problematic, but again, we're just coming off a strong pullback in which I personally believe that BTC was more influential than anything else. Those 3-4 days that precipitated that pullback were dictated by BTC's lack of momentum more than ETH's. While the second push after the ATH was certainly a bit weak, I really think we need to wait and see what happen over these next few days. If what played out tonight continues through, we'll likely see a lot of these indicators flip right back. \n\n> You also might be underestimating ETH's potential gains by simply judging it against its own history. I know that may sound a bit ridiculous, but look at the recent volume. If ETH is really going to start breaking from BTC a bit, which the analysis against the ratio seems to predict, then we may be looking at a very different asset over the next few weeks/months. [Consider BTC's historical indicators during these runs, for example.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3L71p85m/)\u2014logic is hardly of dire consequence.\n\n> You might think I'm being a bit overly optimistic here, and I'll admit that is certainly true, and in part, that's simply because I'm playing the positive side of your doubt on purpose. I'm not one to encourage empty optimism. So I'm looking forward to hearing more of your side tomorrow. \n\n> And for the sake of a bit of skepticism before I run, let's say that we do take another dive here, and/or slow down a bit for awhile. This begs the question, if the ratio analysis seems so solid, are we really going to pull back here? And if so, is that going to crush the ratio formations?\u2014[Not necessarily, take a look at BTC's chart right now.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tt8egELn/)\n\n> You could see this one of two ways. The first as a consolidation/flag pattern, but the second way that I see it is, a little bear flag whose tail is struggling to get above the conversion line, and even further, a conversion line that's just crossed down. Now, admittedly, this is a pretty weak bearish cross, but a bearish one nonetheless. So it might not be ridiculous to see another drop to the \\~24k-27k zone, bouncing off the cloud, before regaining real momentum. \n\n> And along with this, ETH has outperformed BTC for the last couple of weeks regardless. So sure, maybe you're right. Maybe we see ETH just consolidate a bit more while BTC does the same, only at a ratio that still drives us forward. \n\n> Anyway, those are my thoughts.
