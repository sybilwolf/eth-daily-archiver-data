New ATH! Now let's updoot the daily and make sure r/All knows about it.\n\nWell, now that we are in price discovery mode, I think it is time to introduce ETH to all of the newcomers coming in from r/all.\n\n#What the fuck is ETH?\n\nIn short, ETH is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum smart contract platform. It is the second largest cryptocurrency by marketcap (see a list here: https://www.coingecko.com/en).\n\n**So why Ethereum and what makes it different to Bitcoin?**\n\nOne way to think of Bitcoin vs Ethereum is if Bitcoin is a calculator, then Ethereum is a desktop computer. Like a calculator can only do maths (but it does it well), Bitcoin is good at one thing and that is being a currency/scarce store of value with only 21 million coins. Ethereum on the other hand is a computer. It is a turing complete decentralised computer which can run a wide range of programs. One use case for this is DeFi (Decentralised Finance) which is where you can get loans or earn interest on cryptocurrencies or US dollar stable coins in a permissionless, peer to peer manner. To simplify that, you can access loans, lend money and make interest and buy synthetic assets (cryptocurrencies which match the price action of real world assets like gold or Tesla stock) all without needing to ask a bank, broker or government to allow you or help you do it. You can do it all on your own through the new open financial system built on Ethereum. But use cases don't stop there. Ethereum also has NFTs or \"Non-Fungible Tokens\" which are unique coins. These are used for things like tokenising ownership real world assets such as real-estate and letting people buy fractions of it (see [RealT tokens](https://realt.co/)) or for gaming. See [God's Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/), a Hearthstone-like card game where the cards are NFTs which are tradeable on the open market. Imagine a future where Fortnite skins and COD Warzone items have real world value and are traded on Ethereum.\n\nThese use cases only scratch the surface of what Ethereum can do.\n\n**So what do I do? Where do I buy ETH?**\n\nDon't just FOMO into ETH because we told you to. Please educate yourself. There is a great list of resources here: https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/k098s1/hey_ethfinance_lets_make_a_list_of_links/\n\nI also recommend the [Bankless newsletter and podcast.](https://banklesshq.com/opportunities/) Their free stuff starting from the beginning is a great introduction to crypto and Ethereum (Personally, I think their first 8 or so podcast episodes are the best introduction).\n\nFeel free to ask our friendly community any of your questions in the pinned r/ETHTrader community discussion post and the r/EthFinance daily discussion.\n\nFinally, if you do just want to FOMO into ETH, Coinbase is probably the best option but services like PayPal also offer you price exposure (It's worth noting that if you're in a small or 3rd world country, the big name exchanges likely won't accept your currency so just find a local exchange instead. For example, Independent Reserve is a great exchange for Aus/NZ). However, as you learn more about crypto, you should take custody of your own crypto assets rather than trusting Coinbase or PayPal to hold your crypto. For that, check out the Argent wallet app on mobile app stores or buy a hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor but only buy them from the official websites.\n\n***By the way, the crypto space is like going west in the frontier days. Opportunities to make money are everywhere but there are lots of bandits about. Be alert for scammers and never send anyone money because they claim to be doing a giveaway or because they say they have a trading program. They are lying and just want to take your money.***\n\nOne last piece of advice if you do buy ETH is to ignore price volatility in the short term. Crypto likes to go up and down 50% in a day sometimes. Don't let this bother you. This is a long term play and ignore short term volatility. This is easier said than done but scary 40%+ pull backs are the price you pay for such a big potential upside. Just keep calm and hold your crypto for years. Due to the scarcity of BTC and ETH you will be glad to hold onto it in the long term.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, here are some of my own personal resources for newcomers:\n\n- An easy to understand introduction to ETH 2.0:\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/k02ggn/an_easy_to_understand_introduction_to_eth_20_and/\n\n- Every single reason I am bullish on ETH:\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jhrqv1/a_detailed_summary_of_every_single_reason_why_i/\n\n- Minimum Viable Issuance: Why Ethereum\u2019s lack of a hard cap is actually a good thing.\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/\n\n- Are You New Or Does This Dip Have You Spooked? - Here's The Most Important Lesson I Learned in Investing And It Is Very Relevant Right Now.: \nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/inbnbz/are_you_new_or_does_this_dip_have_you_spooked/\n\n- Do YOU Have an Exit Strategy?

Due to the scarcity of BTC and ETH you will be glad to hold onto it in the long term.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Finally, here are some of my own personal resources for newcomers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>An easy to understand introduction to ETH 2.0:\n<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/k02ggn/an_easy_to_understand_introduction_to_eth_20_and/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/k02ggn/an_easy_to_understand_introduction_to_eth_20_and/</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Every single reason I am bullish on ETH:\n<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jhrqv1/a_detailed_summary_of_every_single_reason_why_i/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jhrqv1/a_detailed_summary_of_every_single_reason_why_i/</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Minimum Viable Issuance: Why Ethereum\u2019s lack of a hard cap is actually a good thing.\n<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Are You New Or Does This Dip Have You Spooked? - Here&#39;s The Most Important Lesson I Learned in Investing And It Is Very Relevant Right Now.: \n<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/inbnbz/are_you_new_or_does_this_dip_have_you_spooked/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/inbnbz/are_you_new_or_does_this_dip_have_you_spooked/</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Do YOU Have an Exit Strategy?

I believe the key to smart investments in crypto are the following:  \n\n1) Only invest what you can afford to lose. (This is the **single most important rule**). You must assume that for every dollar you put in, you will lose 100% of it.  \n2) Dollar cost average. Put in a small amount on a regular basis, and withdraw a small amount to fiat according to your plan.  \n3) Have a sell plan. Sell small amounts to DCA out, or to take the initial investment out once you have reached that point, leaving the profit to ride the highs and lows.  \n4) Record your trades for tax time.  \n5) Pay your taxes. **Edit: and put some money aside for taxes in case you incur a loss that you can't liquidate to pay off earlier gains.**  \n6) Research the tokens you are purchasing. Not just the price on Coingecko, certainly not sentiment on /r/Cryptomoonshots or even/r/Ethfinance.  \n- Who makes up the team, what are their histories? What is the point of the token  \n-Does the token have value beyond speculation, or is it a buy and hold coin purely for price appreciation?  \n- What is the price history of the token?  \n- How many whales are there, and what is the token distribution among the development team and initial investors?  \n- What is the lockup period for the initial token holders?  \n- Can you sell the coin after you have purchased it (I'm not sure how to audit smart contracts so if someone could help me with this one that would be great)? Too many tokens have code written in them that prevent the token from being traded after first sold.  \n7) Don't buy or sell based upon emotion. See point 1).  \n8) Don't shill your bags to anyone you know. Certainly don't tell them to invest, because if they lose money, they will hold you responsible.  \n9) Don't tell anyone how many coins you have, even on the internet.  \n10) Not your private keys, not your tokens. Get your own wallet and keep your funds off exchanges if possible, or use only highly reputable exchanges if you don't want to use Decentralized Exchanges.  \n11) Don't share your private keys. Store them somewhere safe, and ensure they are protected from damage, loss or theft.  \n12) Use a separate email address for crypto, and use different passwords for all your crypto related accounts.  \n13) Have a method of retrieval for your tokens in case you pass away suddenly. Personally, I keep the codes for my keys for my hardware and browser wallets in three separate locations, each with only 1/3 each of the information required to access the actual phrase. This keeps each individual holder from unlocking my wallets themselves, as well as ensuring my beneficiary is the only person who knows how to access it all. \n\nAnyone got any other rules?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some people are overinvested. I believe the key to smart investments in crypto are the following:  </p>\n\n<p>1) Only invest what you can afford to lose. (This is the <strong>single most important rule</strong>). You must assume that for every dollar you put in, you will lose 100% of it.<br/>\n2) Dollar cost average. Put in a small amount on a regular basis, and withdraw a small amount to fiat according to your plan.<br/>\n3) Have a sell plan. Sell small amounts to DCA out, or to take the initial investment out once you have reached that point, leaving the profit to ride the highs and lows.<br/>\n4) Record your trades for tax time.<br/>\n5) Pay your taxes. <strong>Edit: and put some money aside for taxes in case you incur a loss that you can&#39;t liquidate to pay off earlier gains.</strong><br/>\n6) Research the tokens you are purchasing. Not just the price on Coingecko, certainly not sentiment on <a href=\"/r/Cryptomoonshots\">/r/Cryptomoonshots</a> or even<a href=\"/r/Ethfinance\">/r/Ethfinance</a>.<br/>\n- Who makes up the team, what are their histories? What is the point of the token<br/>\n-Does the token have value beyond speculation, or is it a buy and hold coin purely for price appreciation?<br/>\n- What is the price history of the token?<br/>\n- How many whales are there, and what is the token distribution among the development team and initial investors?<br/>\n- What is the lockup period for the initial token holders?<br/>\n- Can you sell the coin after you have purchased it (I&#39;m not sure how to audit smart contracts so if someone could help me with this one that would be great)? Too many tokens have code written in them that prevent the token from being traded after first sold.<br/>\n7) Don&#39;t buy or sell based upon emotion. See point 1).<br/>\n8) Don&#39;t shill your bags to anyone you know. Certainly don&#39;t tell them to invest, because if they lose money, they will hold you responsible.<br/>\n9) Don&#39;t tell anyone how many coins you have, even on the internet.<br/>\n10) Not your private keys, not your tokens. Get your own wallet and keep your funds off exchanges if possible, or use only highly reputable exchanges if you don&#39;t want to use Decentralized Exchanges.<br/>\n11) Don&#39;t share your private keys. Store them somewhere safe, and ensure they are protected from damage, loss or theft.<br/>\n12) Use a separate email address for crypto, and use different passwords for all your crypto related accounts.<br/>\n13) Have a method of retrieval for your tokens in case you pass away suddenly.

Well after dispelling that FUD in another sub, I'm here to share my response as to why ETH under ETH 2.0 will actually accrue value better than Bitcoin:\n\nThere are multiple reasons why ETH will accrue value as Ethereum network usage increases:\n\n- First, ETH the asset is required to use the network. You want a loan in USDC? Pay gas in ETH.\n\n- Secondly, ETH limits the \"economic bandwidth\" of the network. What does this mean? It's the max capacity of the Ethereum network to hold value. If all 115 million ETH were priced at one dollar, you couldn't mint more than $75 million dollars worth of DAI the decentralised stablecoin because DAI is backed by ETH at a minimum collateralisation ratio of 150%. This applies to most DeFi protocols, so naturally, as DeFi usage goes up, the price of ETH must go up too.\n\n- 32 ETH is required to stake ETH and earn interest on your ETH. That means that only around 3.5 million people could ever stake their 32 ETH. There will be a lot of demand for people who want 32 ETH in the future.\n\n- Finally, with ETH 2.0 and EIP-1559, net ETH issuance could likely go negative. Inflation under ETH 2.0 is going to be below 1% annually while the fee burning from EIP-1559 will likely exceed this based on recent network usage stats.\n\nNow let's compare back to Bitcoin. Bitcoin only has the first point that ETH has, it is also required to use the network. While Bitcoin doesn't have a chance to have a deflationary issuance schedule which ETH will have, it does have a hard cap. Personally, I prefer ETH's model more as not only will it likely become deflationary, but the stakers will still be paid enough to keep the network secure unlike Bitcoin which has a dangerously low security budget paid to miners after enough halvings take place. Some people will prefer the 21 million hard cap model, and I understand that, but fundamentally, ETH actually has more going for it driving value to the ETH token than Bitcoin has.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Who&#39;s sick of hearing the FUD that ETH supposedly won&#39;t accrue value like Bitcoin even if Ethereum itself becomes widespread?

APYs aren't being routinely published (you can probably do the calculations if you want to set up a Dune dashboard, but that's beyond most people's level of effort, definitely mine) yet, but you can expect them to be added to the myriad options for viewing v1 APYs in the next couple weeks.\n\nEXAMPLE: \n\nv2 Vaults charge a 2% annual management fee on your deposits, and take 20% of the generated yield as a performance fee. Rough figures if you put $1000 in. \n\nDeposit at 100 gwei gas (all too common these days) is probably going to run you ~$10-15 for the token approval, and an additional $20 (? haven't deposited to v2 myself yet, guesstimating) to do the deposit. Withdrawal, another $20. \n\nSo, on top of vault fees, you're probably looking at ~$50 in gas.\n\nVault yield is, say, 50%. End of the year, your deposit is now worth $1500. They'll take 20% of that 50%, so the effective yield for you will be only 40%. You end up with $1000, plus $400. Charge the 2% annual fee on $1400, you're paying $28 for asset management, and you end up with $1372, and you've paid $50 in gas, so you've profited by $322.\n\n*I'm not positive what the order of operations is on this one. If the performance fee comes out before the management fee, you pay less in management; if it comes out after, you pay more.\n\nFormula for your holdings would be:\nBalance after 1 year =  0.98 (Deposit * (1 + (vault APY * 0.8))) - (gas costs)\n\nWhile we don't have much data yet on the APY of the v2 vaults, Andre tweeted an initial calculation: USDC at 55%, DAI at 28%. Net of fees, that's roughly 41% and 20% effective yields, respectively. \n\nFor a $1k deposit, you need that rate to last about 3 months to cover your gas fees in and out to the DAI vault, or 1.5 months in the USDC vault. Scale that to your deposit size; gas costs are going to be roughly the same regardless of the size of your deposit, but returns and fees will scale up accordingly. I should add--I'm not bothering to convert the interest from discrete to continuous compounding, but it's good enough for eyeballing it.\n\nI'd guess that yields on these vaults will come down to closer to where v1 vaults are: 10-20%. Maybe a little higher, as they can use some pretty cool and esoteric strategies in v2, but you're unlikely to do *worse* than 10% annually. Assuming worst case, you need to cover $50 in gas for it to be worth it, which would take you about 6 months if you're putting in a min. $1000. \n\nI keep mentioning $1k because it's a round figure that makes math easy, and your returns have to be bonkers to make back your gas fees in under 3 months if you're investing any less than $1k, and the less you're investing, the more you're locked into a platform to break even before you can move funds to a higher yield vehicle.\n\nSomething else to consider: that gas that you spend now is denominated in ETH; it could appreciate a lot more than the stablecoins. However, if you're like me, you want money in stablecoins as a hedge on the volatility in ETH.\n\n\nLong explanation, I hope you find this helpful.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Okay, so here&#39;s the calculus on that:</p>\n\n<p>v2 Vaults (for stablecoins) that have currently launched are DAI and USDC.
