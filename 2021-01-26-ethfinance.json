Very arbitrary. Every transaction will use a certain amount of gas depending on the complexity (more complex, more computing power, more gas). Your transaction cost has two components: how much gas it takes to run your transaction, and how much you have to bid per unit of gas to get miners to process your transaction instead of anybody else's.\n\n If I set my gas price to 51 Gwei, and you set yours to 50, and we're asking for the same amount of computing power/doing the same transaction, a miner will process my transaction first, because they get more money for it. \n\nIf I get outbid by someone else who's willing to pay 100 Gwei per unit of gas, their transaction will go through before both of ours. \n\nThat's the simple explanation. Gas fees are a giant pain in the ass, and predicting a priori how much a given transaction will end up costing is hugely difficult.
