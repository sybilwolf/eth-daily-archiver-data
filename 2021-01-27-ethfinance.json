If they have a massive amount of cash savings, they would be under pressure from shareholders to either invest it back in the business or pay it out as dividends. Massive amount of Americans are these shareholders, and not just the rich. And many companies do share their profits with their workers in the form of bonuses, equity, and pay raises. Awful ones don\u2019t but over time they attract shit employees and die. If you\u2019re a company that doesn\u2019t invest or reward shareholders, then your competitors will and you\u2019ll get left behind. </p>\n\n<p>Lots of companies do share buybacks because that\u2019s a way of giving profits back to the shareholders. It\u2019s not their fault if the government is incompetent and doesn\u2019t put appropriate limits on how they should use bailout funds. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not denying there\u2019s a ton of fuckery and exploitation of bailouts, and I don\u2019t deny that the average guy gets fucked repeatedly. But at time of extreme crisis, you can\u2019t expect a business to be able to fund their very capital intensive operations for months on end by themselves if you\u2019re not giving them the chance to operate like normal. If the taxpayers through the government demand a business stop generating revenue, then the taxpayers through the government are obligated to make them whole otherwise you get long-term disruption to the economy and to people\u2019s lives, not just the rich. 90% of the time I\u2019m against bailouts, but they\u2019re not always bad and they\u2019re not always just a way to reward the rich.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-27 14:38:24","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-01-27 14:42:19","id":"gl0edax","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l5xsvi","parent_id":"t1_gl0c1le","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jumnhy","body":"Oh, I hear what you're saying, but they're operating with two sets of rules: one where they get to keep all the marbles when they win, and another when they take all our marbles when they lose.\n\nPrivatized profits, socialized losses.

I've never meaningfully used my Facebook account (the only reason I signed up is to keep people from hitting on my SO), I've never Tweeted, I've never posted to Instagram, etc.  Three years ago, I gave in and created a Reddit account, because Ledger made me upset, and I felt obligated to take their CTO down a peg or three (see my oldest comments!).  In 2012, people thought I was odd for taking a principled stance regarding how society shares information.  Today, I've been fully vindicated.

It's time to take back social media, and I need your help.  \n\nIf society is to function properly, people must be able to epxress themselves.  Obviously some opinions are inappropriate or even dangerous, but that doesn't prevent people from holding them, and suppression won't change anyone's mind.  If we're to move forward honestly, we must find a way to allow complete freedom of expression, without condoning behavior that is unequivocally harmful.  I see a great opportunity to accomplish this via Ethereum, enhanced by the recently announced collaboration between Reddit and the Ethereum Foundation.  Please bear with me as I explain:  \n\nThe holy grail is to build and operate a completely decentralized version of what I describe below, but real progress can be made while decentralized identity verification remains a difficult problem.  The basic idea is simple:  We need a social network where the true identity of individuals is never exposed, but where they remain accountable for their ideas and contributions.  The fundamental motivation is that the quality and merit of ideas should never depend on who proposes them, but that entities must simultaneously be held accountable for harmful behavior.  Ethereum makes this possible!  \n\nWhat would such a system look like?  To start, Reddit would require rigorous proof of identity for a new kind of account.  Legacy accounts would still be available, but would not enjoy the benefits of strong verification.  Rigorously verified accounts would have a special privilege: being able to spawn an unlimited number of avatars indirectly linked to the hidden core identity.  Why?  Because it would create a new dynamic: everyone would know such avatars were accountable, but no one would know who they really are.  Think of it as an ambiguous blue check mark.  No one would be able to figure out who you are unless you give them clues, but they would know you aren't an unaccountable sock puppet or troll.  \n\nZK proofs make this feasible in a way thay has never been possible before.  I wanted to build such a system more than five years ago, but it wasn't practical, and I ended up seeking my fortune while waiting (so far so good!).

So we're lacking spot buying pressure here, and shorters take advantage. That's my guess, but the data to confirm this is surely out there (check out Willy Woo on twitter, maybe). Coin margined funding rates on perpetuals are now negative on several exchanges --[https://www.viewbase.com/funding](https://www.viewbase.com/funding) \\-- i.e. shorts are paying longs on positions.\n\nSo we have a surfeit of short pressure. If bears can't push things below 30k and say 1200 (maybe lower) that seems pretty bullish to me, going forward. I understand that not everyone here is familiar with margin trading, so the point is: those shorts (sells on borrowed assets) are *already open*, and need to close at some point. Closing shorts is literally buying. This is to say, we have upside. Shorts may end up trapped if the price pulls up from here. Of course, that is not to say that things can't go significantly further in the other direction, first. :)  \n\nI don't know a lot about the technical side of blockchains, but I came across this neato academic paper which is in my wheelhouse.

So we&#39;re lacking spot buying pressure here, and shorters take advantage. That&#39;s my guess, but the data to confirm this is surely out there (check out Willy Woo on twitter, maybe).

If bears can&#39;t push things below 30k and say 1200 (maybe lower) that seems pretty bullish to me, going forward.
