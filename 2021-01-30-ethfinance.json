This post includes updates from various activity this week including:\n\n\u2026this week\u2019s [Eth2 Implementers call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WK3k_k-4w8&ab_channel=EthereumFoundation). Big up u/benjaminion\u2019s [call notes](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/H1FdGQxlx) and newsletter. The call confirmed a couple of things>\n\n**The planned mid-year Eth2 chain upgrade (now codenamed \u2018HF1\u2019) is still on track.** The main contents of HF1 will likely be agreed in the next two weeks with at least a view on the minor items by that time also. HF1 is planned to be on main testnet for a month prior to launch, with smaller testnets a further month prior to that, although this can be happening as soon as there is consensus on the contents. [Vitalik has views on this.](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/HF1_proposal)\n\nAdditionally **work on specs for the Eth1/Eth2 merge has confirmed started.** An initial draft is in circulation already. The Lighthouse client team will also shortly be ready to start looking into the merge API. So good progress in that area. **Keep in mind that neither the merge nor sharding are likely to launch in 2021.** The aim is to get the first of these (it\u2019s not decided which yet, but likely the merge) onto production testnets before the end of the year.\n\nAlso many new developments in the L2 scaleability space. There is so much going on here I literally cannot keep up:\n\n- dYdX have their [Layer 2 coming soon!](https://integral.dydx.exchange/2020-review/)\n\n- StakWare posted [their roadmap for 2021 for scaling the ecosystem with zk rollups.](https://medium.com/starkware/on-the-road-to-starknet-a-permissionless-stark-powered-l2-zk-rollup-83be53640880)\n\n- Loopring have a sick new writeup on their [L2 tokenomics.](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/lrc-tokenomics-v2-1e6fd99e9e9c)\n\n- Connext continue to pump out updates.

This post includes updates from various activity this week including:</p>\n\n<p>\u2026this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WK3k_k-4w8&amp;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation\">Eth2 Implementers call</a>. Big up <a href=\"/u/benjaminion\">u/benjaminion</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/H1FdGQxlx\">call notes</a> and newsletter. The call confirmed a couple of things&gt;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The planned mid-year Eth2 chain upgrade (now codenamed \u2018HF1\u2019) is still on track.</strong> The main contents of HF1 will likely be agreed in the next two weeks with at least a view on the minor items by that time also. HF1 is planned to be on main testnet for a month prior to launch, with smaller testnets a further month prior to that, although this can be happening as soon as there is consensus on the contents. <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/HF1_proposal\">Vitalik has views on this.</a></p>\n\n<p>Additionally <strong>work on specs for the Eth1/Eth2 merge has confirmed started.</strong> An initial draft is in circulation already. The Lighthouse client team will also shortly be ready to start looking into the merge API. So good progress in that area. <strong>Keep in mind that neither the merge nor sharding are likely to launch in 2021.</strong> The aim is to get the first of these (it\u2019s not decided which yet, but likely the merge) onto production testnets before the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Also many new developments in the L2 scaleability space. There is so much going on here I literally cannot keep up:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>dYdX have their <a href=\"https://integral.dydx.exchange/2020-review/\">Layer 2 coming soon!</a></p></li>\n<li><p>StakWare posted <a href=\"https://medium.com/starkware/on-the-road-to-starknet-a-permissionless-stark-powered-l2-zk-rollup-83be53640880\">their roadmap for 2021 for scaling the ecosystem with zk rollups.</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Loopring have a sick new writeup on their <a href=\"https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/lrc-tokenomics-v2-1e6fd99e9e9c\">L2 tokenomics.</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Connext continue to pump out updates.

Respectfully submitting for thoughts and feedback.\n\nI'll admit it.  I have been an over-tinkerer for the last two months.  The DeFi bug has got me good.  From early 2018 to late 2020, I did nothing at all but HODL and sprinkle in a few (NOT ENOUGH!) ETH buys on occasion.  \n\nEven the Summer of DeFi didn't reel me back in...which may be OK considering it was a Fall of Not DeFi.\n\nBut since early December, I've poked and prodded.  Staked AAVE and SNX.  Traded synths, retired debt, and moved SNX to L2.  Lent sUSD for an alarmingly high rate on Aave.  Poked around on Loopring L2.  I've jumped into liquidity pools on UNI and I've farmed for yield on Alpha Homora, ArmorFi, Curve, and more.  I've baked pies in the ovens at PieDao.  \n\nI've even played shitcoin roulette, which I'd sworn off YEARS ago.\n\nHoly shit...the money I've spent on gas.  I'm going to have to treat it as tuition expense.  Many or even most of these experiments have been small-ish, so the gas has been high as a percentage of the transactions.\n\nI have learned a few things.  I'm a bit of an experiential learner.  Could I have calculated these things ahead of time?  Sure.  But at these smaller amounts, I actually LIKE to walk through the transactions, see the interfaces, record results, and re-evaluate.  \n\n* Lending rates in crypto are incredibly variable.  This matters, especially for small amounts.  I lent sUSD at 80%, but realize that it cost gas both ways, so when the flash rates at Aave drop, the deal becomes less compelling. \n* What else COULD you do with that asset?  I'll use sUSD as an example again.  I bought sDEFI with some and I lent some at 80%.  The loan rate came down.  sDEFI is up close to 300% since I bought that.  Loaning at 80% sounds amazing, but the opportunity cost (not to mention the gas cost) was high.  That 80% per year doesn't turn out to be a better return than HODLING ETH in a bull market.  sDEFI probably does turn out better, but we'll see.\n* Liquidity pools are trickier than they look.  Seems simple.  Deposit...earn fees...party.  My least favorite pool is one that I pulled out of this morning....ETH/USDC.  I will be mostly be avoiding liquidity pools unless I think the assets are on a similar trajectory.  Impermanent loss dictates that you lose some of the asset that does better.  What you make in fees will not make up the difference.\n* Liquidity pooling COULD work as a hedge, of course.  If ETH had dropped, I would lose less in an ETH/USDC pool.  So I'll keep that in mind.  \n* You can pool with LEVERAGE at Alpha Homora.  They have 2.5x and 2.75x leverage right now and they will introduce 9x leverage soon.  This will really up the stakes. One could lose a LOT of an asset to impermanent loss.  I'd be really careful about pooling with differential trajectory there.  \n* If the assets are on a similar trajectory (maybe something like ETH/LINK or ETH/SNX?), leverage and yield might make it a hot deal.  Sometimes the yields are surprisingly high, but they usually taper off--quickly at times.  I've banked about $500 in ARMOR in less than 3 days with something like 3 ETH.  It's bananas.  Hopefully, that will more than offset the impermanent loss, but I will have to keep my eye on it, I think.  \n* I think the pool I like the most for the long term is ETH/stETH at Curve.  stETH and ETH should follow a similar trajectory, right?  The rewards are not nearly as good, but stETH grows all the time, and virtually no impermanent loss.  \n* That said, I think staking ETH is the best game in town, by far.  I've staked at StakeFish.  Cost me 0.1 ETH, which is far less than I would have spent on hardware.  At least for now, the return is freaking amazing.  I love watching the ETH balance grow.  \n* The very best move I made was selling an emotional bag.  It wasn't a financial bag....this was ALL profit, damn near.  I had some XMR from 2014-2015 that was, at the time, practically wallet dust when XMR was less than $1 for years.  You're supposed to cull the losers and hodl the winners, but I finally cut loose of a not-insignificant chunk of XMR after more than a 100x gain.  I used about half of that for DPI and half for ETH.  This was the right move.  \n* The worst move has been loving too many shiny DeFi assets.  I hodl more different assets than I need to be hodling right now.  I think it doesn't make sense to spread the bets too thin.  I have something like 10 different shiny objects and I also have sDEFI, DPI, and a couple of PieDao pies.  \n\nWhat am I missing?   What did I get wrong?  Thoughts?  Suggestions!\n\nIf you took the time to read that mess, I appreciate it!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I started writing this....and it got LONG.

Many or even most of these experiments have been small-ish, so the gas has been high as a percentage of the transactions.</p>\n\n<p>I have learned a few things.  I&#39;m a bit of an experiential learner.  Could I have calculated these things ahead of time?  Sure.  But at these smaller amounts, I actually LIKE to walk through the transactions, see the interfaces, record results, and re-evaluate.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lending rates in crypto are incredibly variable.  This matters, especially for small amounts.  I lent sUSD at 80%, but realize that it cost gas both ways, so when the flash rates at Aave drop, the deal becomes less compelling. </li>\n<li>What else COULD you do with that asset?  I&#39;ll use sUSD as an example again.  I bought sDEFI with some and I lent some at 80%.  The loan rate came down.  sDEFI is up close to 300% since I bought that.  Loaning at 80% sounds amazing, but the opportunity cost (not to mention the gas cost) was high.  That 80% per year doesn&#39;t turn out to be a better return than HODLING ETH in a bull market.  sDEFI probably does turn out better, but we&#39;ll see.</li>\n<li>Liquidity pools are trickier than they look.  Seems simple.  Deposit...earn fees...party.  My least favorite pool is one that I pulled out of this morning....ETH/USDC.  I will be mostly be avoiding liquidity pools unless I think the assets are on a similar trajectory.  Impermanent loss dictates that you lose some of the asset that does better.  What you make in fees will not make up the difference.</li>\n<li>Liquidity pooling COULD work as a hedge, of course.  If ETH had dropped, I would lose less in an ETH/USDC pool.  So I&#39;ll keep that in mind.<br/></li>\n<li>You can pool with LEVERAGE at Alpha Homora.  They have 2.5x and 2.75x leverage right now and they will introduce 9x leverage soon.  This will really up the stakes. One could lose a LOT of an asset to impermanent loss.  I&#39;d be really careful about pooling with differential trajectory there.<br/></li>\n<li>If the assets are on a similar trajectory (maybe something like ETH/LINK or ETH/SNX?), leverage and yield might make it a hot deal.  Sometimes the yields are surprisingly high, but they usually taper off--quickly at times.  I&#39;ve banked about $500 in ARMOR in less than 3 days with something like 3 ETH.  It&#39;s bananas.  Hopefully, that will more than offset the impermanent loss, but I will have to keep my eye on it, I think.<br/></li>\n<li>I think the pool I like the most for the long term is ETH/stETH at Curve.  stETH and ETH should follow a similar trajectory, right?  The rewards are not nearly as good, but stETH grows all the time, and virtually no impermanent loss.<br/></li>\n<li>That said, I think staking ETH is the best game in town, by far.  I&#39;ve staked at StakeFish.  Cost me 0.1 ETH, which is far less than I would have spent on hardware.  At least for now, the return is freaking amazing.  I love watching the ETH balance grow.<br/></li>\n<li>The very best move I made was selling an emotional bag.  It wasn&#39;t a financial bag....this was ALL profit, damn near.  I had some XMR from 2014-2015 that was, at the time, practically wallet dust when XMR was less than $1 for years.  You&#39;re supposed to cull the losers and hodl the winners, but I finally cut loose of a not-insignificant chunk of XMR after more than a 100x gain.  I used about half of that for DPI and half for ETH.  This was the right move.<br/></li>\n<li>The worst move has been loving too many shiny DeFi assets.  I hodl more different assets than I need to be hodling right now.  I think it doesn&#39;t make sense to spread the bets too thin.  I have something like 10 different shiny objects and I also have sDEFI, DPI, and a couple of PieDao pies.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What am I missing?   What did I get wrong?  Thoughts?  Suggestions!</p>\n\n<p>If you took the time to read that mess, I appreciate it!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-30 13:41:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"glet7jb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l8fafk","parent_id":"t3_l8fafk","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-30 15:13:59","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-01-30 16:37:56","id":"glf4j4x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l8fafk","parent_id":"t1_glet7jb","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/vuduchyld","body":"Totally agree with all that.

Disagreements are resolved by the work that miners do.</p>\n\n<p>More detail:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quiknode.io/guides/defi/how-to-access-ethereum-mempool\">https://www.quiknode.io/guides/defi/how-to-access-ethereum-mempool</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-30 02:32:09","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-01-30 02:35:09","id":"glctqh1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l8fafk","parent_id":"t1_glcoh9c","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"A DEX is really more of an interface for a smart contract that lives on the Etheruem network.

Are there better, more effective ways to do this. I started purchasing UNI, Aave and a few others but I\u2019m 80% ETH, 10% BTC & 10% other. Any insight of how to do this better is most helpful.

You will owe taxes on any of your gains when you do this. So when I trade UNI for ETH, say, after my UNI airdrop, I have to pay the taxes on the gains--how much more the UNI is worth now than when I bought it. If I switch for ETH, I still owe those taxes, even if ETH then drops hard in value, say the price goes down by half. Still gotta pay your taxes on the larger amount that it was worth at the time of the exchange. \n\nNumeric example:\n\nI buy $200 worth of UNI. It increases in value to $1000. I then trade it for 1 ETH, for ease of math, let's say at a value of $1000. I created a taxable event by selling, so I get taxed on the $800 difference between my buy and sell price. If ETH then drops to only $100 (yikes) I'll still owe somewhere in the neighborhood of 15-20% of that $800, let's say 20%, so I'd owe $160 in taxes, but my ETH is now only worth $100. I could sell my ETH, and use that to pay the taxes at the end of the year*, but I'd still be in the hole $60.\n\nWhat I'm proposing is a smart contract that looks at when you bought your asset, gives you an option to automatically calculate what your tax on the sale would be, and automatically deducts that from the trade when you do it, and puts that money into a stablecoin (which won't drop in value later). \n\nSo in this case, I'd sell my UNI for $1k, and $160 would get swapped into USDC or what have you, and only $840 would get used to buy ETH. At the end of the year, you could have one wallet that you routed all your tax money into, and avoid the situation where you fuck yourself into not having the tax money because you made shit trades.\n\nI'm picturing something that would give a rough estimate of tax liability at the time of the swap. Compliance wise, it'd be really hard to do this totally automatically (tax rates vary on your overall income and tax bracket, how much you've gained, what other tax deductions you have, and how long you hold between trades), but a simple version would just let you set a custom percentage to take out and save for taxes.\n\nSomeone else mentioned having it route the deduction into an interesting earning token, like aDAI from Aave, or y3CRV from Yearn. That would be a nice twist--you could err on the side of overestimating your taxes, earn interest on all the money you didn't need for taxes, and pay your taxes with the interest-earning stablecoin at the end of the year.\n\n*In actuality, you could sell the $100 ETH at the end of the year, and this would be another taxable event, but instead of gains, you're realizing losses. Up to a certain dollar amount, losses can be used to offset your gains, so it might not end up being as bad as $60 in the hole.
