I prefer to be adding to a position which is in profit. I begin positions with stops very far from my entry, bringing them close when i am profitable or when support has established (this means sitting on a loss, at times). I listen to other viewpoints. I don&#39;t try to outsmart the market or call macro tops before they happen (I believe that the top will be a blow-off which <em>should</em> be obvious to everyone who isn&#39;t euphoric/delusional). anecdotally, the biggest trading wins that I hear of are people who trade in a similar way -- early entries, held for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>that was all a preamble to hopefully convince you that I&#39;m not an idiot and I have some idea of what I&#39;m talking about. this is what I have learned from CT these past months:</p>\n\n<p><em>high leveraged, intra-day multi-millionaire crypto traders are</em> <strong><em>full of shit.</em></strong> 90% of the people I follow have been consistently stopped out or torn to bits in the chop these past weeks. &quot;volatility is a trader&#39;s best friend&quot; my <em>ass</em>. a steady trend with the odd dip is a trader&#39;s best friend. while these dudes definitely do have massive bankrolls, there is <em>no way</em> that they got them day trading. they got them from either getting in early and buying throughout bears, or by long-term swing trading.</p>\n\n<p>so, don&#39;t be fooled by the big baller making 6 figure plays on twitter. that&#39;s <strong>not</strong> how they got rich, it&#39;s just how they amuse themselves now that they are rich. patience is the key, whether you&#39;re a hodl&#39;r or a degen trader.   &lt;3</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-01 17:20:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"glod5eb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l9wbhd","parent_id":"t3_l9wbhd","score":39,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/vuduchyld","body":"Yeah, I definitely had you pegged as the real deal.
