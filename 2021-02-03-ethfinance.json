What is the fair value?\n\nI've been in crypto for years, and I've always thought about value as a function of M2 money supply. In other words, if gold has a total market value of $10 trillion, how does that compare to crypto assets? This still makes sense, to some extent, for BTC, because there is a more clear store-of-value narrative and a less-clear network value narrative.\n\nFor ETH, I think there is a way to value based on network value. This is increasing rapidly, but yesterday, ETH generated around $21mm in fees. If I weren't lazy, I'd find a moving 30-day average, but I'm lazy.

If you stretch that out over 12 months capitalize it, and discount it back to today, you'd get a market cap of $273 billion, which is 55% higher than now, so $2464.\n\nI don't think any of that is very accurate, but I do think ETH is worth more than the price today.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Cross posting this, because the damn price keeps changing!</p>\n\n<p>What is ETH really worth?

The only thing i regret right now is not buying more ETH when i had the chance but i&#39;m too traumatized after the 2018 crash. I&#39;ve been bleeding and suffering through the 2018 bear market and if there is one thing i&#39;ve learned, never lose hope on ETH! I have a clear goal and if things continue to go my way, i will soon be able to pay off my mortgages from the profits.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-03 08:55:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"glvovnw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lbh16s","parent_id":"t1_glvj9e3","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/bbqcaramelbrulee","body":"I like how you're thinking!

Holding GME and getting stuck with bags will make this into a case where the big guys win, again. Everybody seems to be leaving out that giant players are also in on Gamestop, trying to squeeze as well. Moreover, at this point entering a new short position isn&#39;t a terrible idea for the big players because everybody knows GME was massively overvalued in the 300&#39;s. (And arguably still is in the 100 range)</p>\n\n<p>I just don&#39;t see how you can fuck the system while also playing by the same rules the big players use; that&#39;s like trying to beat a casino at blackjack. The game is designed to always benefit the house somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto has big players in it now too, don&#39;t get me wrong.

Here are some reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rocket Pool has spent four years researching and developing the most robust decentralized pool staking solution available.</p></li>\n<li><p>Their token currently isn&#39;t listed on any markets, so you literally have to paste the contract address into uniswap to buy any because the founders have zero interest in pumping their token or buying exchange listings.</p></li>\n<li><p>The token is required to participate in Rocket Pool as a staking host, which will definitely be a popular activity.</p></li>\n<li><p>The RPL tokens that are staked by node operators will cause a price squeeze.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Probably a couple more reasons, but I&#39;m gonna slow down. Nothing has excited me as much as Rocket Pool since Augur.

Here's another nice description of funding rates, by Kraken: [https://blog.kraken.com/post/3075/quick-primer-on-funding-rates/](https://blog.kraken.com/post/3075/quick-primer-on-funding-rates/) \n\nPeople have used it for years but it's become widely used in this cycle. I can tell you what I understand.\n\nIt's worth knowing that the rates are adjusted at intervals (every 8 hours, typically). But there are \"predicted funding\" charts which aim to track the rates continuously.\n\nObviously, like *any* indicator it cannot be used in isolation. High funding rates suggest an excess of long pressure (from individuals, and this is what provides a sentiment indicator -- there must be a counterparty long for any given short and vice versa, and open interest alone can't provide this data). But this means that there is a lot of individuals who may wish to close out in the near-term. In other words, all those longs are *open now* and they're *going to need to close/sell* at some point and this would push the price back down. So *ideally* you don't want to be long when lots of other people are, or at least you wanna sell before they do.\n\nBut sometimes bullish unleveraged spot buying can override this, and longs can close and funding rates drop even as the price keeps climbing. The viewbase link above is the one I use.
