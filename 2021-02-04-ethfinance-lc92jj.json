Apologies in advance because this is going to be a different kind of post. I often lurk in this subreddit and out of all the crypto related subs I frequent, this place has the most quality users and posts. \n\nWith that said, I am here seeking help. Even just a few words of wisdom or advice from you level-headed folks.\n\nSo I do not know how to deal with opportunity cost and it is eating me up. More than I can handle mentally right now. I have been in crypto for a while and I am not in danger of losing my money or anything, although the majority of my net worth is in crypto. My portfolio consists of about 70% and and 4 other alts that are seemingly dead. I have been in ETH for some time, so like some/most of you, I have been able to enjoy ETH's recent price action.\n\nMy problem is the rest of my portfolio has been seriously underperforming, most actually down from my buy-in. Not as bad as bear market standards, but it is SERIOUSLY excarebated by other coins just absolutely going bonkers (AAVE, DOGE, UNI, DOT, etc...even XRP is up 40% from last week). \n\nIt is eating me up mentally because I cannot even enjoy the fact that ETH is at new ATH's. It doesn't excite me or make me feel good that my portfolio as a whole isn't doing okay. It absolutely sounds ridiculous because while that is the case, I am in no way hurting financially, and perhaps soon my entire portfolio will actually start to appreciate. \n\nMaybe its just my character, but its hard to stomach seeing other coins go up and most of mine remain stagnant. I know we all cant pick winners everytime, but I feel like I've missed out on some serious gains because I refuse to let go of coins that are underperforming and always assuming they would pump next.\n\nI don't want to turn this discussion into what coin is better than another. Its really not about that. Its about me asking for help to fix my perspective on this whole thing because right now its absolutely broken. I have been absolutely down in the dumps all day when I should be with you guys celebrating.\n\nLiterally 70% of my portfolio is up and I cant even be happy about it.

Apologies in advance because this is going to be a different kind of post. I often lurk in this subreddit and out of all the crypto related subs I frequent, this place has the most quality users and posts. </p>\n\n<p>With that said, I am here seeking help. Even just a few words of wisdom or advice from you level-headed folks.</p>\n\n<p>So I do not know how to deal with opportunity cost and it is eating me up. More than I can handle mentally right now. I have been in crypto for a while and I am not in danger of losing my money or anything, although the majority of my net worth is in crypto. My portfolio consists of about 70% and and 4 other alts that are seemingly dead. I have been in ETH for some time, so like some/most of you, I have been able to enjoy ETH&#39;s recent price action.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is the rest of my portfolio has been seriously underperforming, most actually down from my buy-in. Not as bad as bear market standards, but it is SERIOUSLY excarebated by other coins just absolutely going bonkers (AAVE, DOGE, UNI, DOT, etc...even XRP is up 40% from last week). </p>\n\n<p>It is eating me up mentally because I cannot even enjoy the fact that ETH is at new ATH&#39;s. It doesn&#39;t excite me or make me feel good that my portfolio as a whole isn&#39;t doing okay. It absolutely sounds ridiculous because while that is the case, I am in no way hurting financially, and perhaps soon my entire portfolio will actually start to appreciate. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe its just my character, but its hard to stomach seeing other coins go up and most of mine remain stagnant. I know we all cant pick winners everytime, but I feel like I&#39;ve missed out on some serious gains because I refuse to let go of coins that are underperforming and always assuming they would pump next.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want to turn this discussion into what coin is better than another. Its really not about that. Its about me asking for help to fix my perspective on this whole thing because right now its absolutely broken. I have been absolutely down in the dumps all day when I should be with you guys celebrating.</p>\n\n<p>Literally 70% of my portfolio is up and I cant even be happy about it.

These platforms have their own advantages over curve and usually they are worth it for smaller investors (Haven't done the math here so take it with a grain of salt).\n\nTo give you an example, on curve you need a different tx to claim all your earned crv tokens.

In the end you should calculate all your costs and decide based on your own situation(capital,horizon,risk profile).\n\nEDIT: One other thing I forgot is that some of these platforms reward you with their native token on top of what the strategy makes, so another thing to consider when deciding.

The liquidity mining is highly profitable. Apart from that, this also needs a more nuanced take - Bancor protects you from impermanent loss, which can be quite significant if you provide liquidity for a token that has low liquidity to begin with.
