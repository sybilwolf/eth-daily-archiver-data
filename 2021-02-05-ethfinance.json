Initially my expectation was that it would go up, plateau for a bit and probably fall back down for a while. I wasn&#39;t expecting to pass $1400 any time soon.</p>\n\n<p>In the fall, as momentum built and the beacon chain launch approached, I adjusted my strategy. A new ATH seemed feasible, so I made my sells significantly smaller than they were initially. Didn&#39;t want to wind up having sold a meaningful portion of my ETH at the beginning of the run up.  </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s as far as I&#39;ve thought so far, but I may need to re-evaluate again pretty soon. Most likely I&#39;ll continue with small sells set until I have my initial investment plus a small profit. I&#39;m not sure when that will be, but I think I&#39;m ~75% of the way there. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll probably hold tight after that unless it seems like the top is near.

To make these interoperable, there's already a solution called Connext that lets you transfer between different Layer 2s.\n\nEventually, we will see exchanges like Coinbase offer the option to immediately withdraw to L2 instead of L1.\n\nOver time, L1 will be used only for the most fundamental operations or for transferring to L2, and for settling L2 transactions on L1.\n\nThat's the vision, and we are very close.

Previous Layer 2 scaling solutions like Plasma use state channels which are great for incredibly fast and cheap transactions, but they can&#39;t support smart contracts. Rollups however can.</p>\n\n<p>So every big DeFi dapp and every other dapp can simply copy/paste their code to the rollup and get going. It takes just one transfer from L1 to L2, and as soon as the big DeFi dapps move there, everything else most likely will move there as well. Network effects, baby.</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention that they will almost certainly launch another round of liquidity mining/farming to on-board users to Layer 2.</p>\n\n<p>There are different rollups, for example Optimism and Arbitrum both use optimistic rollups, and there&#39;s also Loopring, Starkware and a couple others that use zk rollups. To make these interoperable, there&#39;s already a solution called Connext that lets you transfer between different Layer 2s.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, we will see exchanges like Coinbase offer the option to immediately withdraw to L2 instead of L1.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, L1 will be used only for the most fundamental operations or for transferring to L2, and for settling L2 transactions on L1.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the vision, and we are very close. Optimism already launched with a small part of Synthetix&#39; dapp on it, and they&#39;ll expand that to all of Synthetix over time to make sure there are no bugs. Next in line is Uniswap in March or so. And so on.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-04 22:28:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gm37ffd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ld0tsy","parent_id":"t1_gm36zau","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/StatSticks","body":"Thanks for the detailed writeup.
