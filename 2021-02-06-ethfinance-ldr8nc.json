Just so many variables. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d be interested to know, but of course the EF and Vitalik will be rightly wary of saying things like &quot;long-term, ETH should cost $X&quot; in a wildly speculative market.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-06 10:05:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gm939p6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ldr8nc","parent_id":"t1_gm8zsbr","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/offthewall1066","body":"Sounds like you should re-think that 50/50 portfolio split.

That ETH will continue to appreciate in value, which means you want to hold the ETH your purchased previously and you won't pay back your loan, or \nb. You believe ETH is going to fall again, so you sell your ETH that you purchased with DAI in step 5 back to DAI again at a higher price in order to repay your loan and book some profit. So: \n\n7a. You continue to hold your recently purchased ETH or put it into your CDP as additional collateral (which doesn't repay your loan), or \n\n7b. You sell your ETH for DAI and repay your loan, and sell your ETH to reduce your ETH exposure to price falls. \n\nTechnically, in this scenario, you are short term bearish, but long term bullish on ETH's price.
