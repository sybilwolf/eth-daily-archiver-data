Do you think a home builder who doesn't do his own taxes is like spilling wine and hiring someone else to clean it? Of course not, because specialization exists. It's just another form of outsourcing labor for the sake of efficiency. Same way that a company that makes concrete can pay for a carbon sequestration project because that company planting their own trees or running their own carbon capture plant is totally inefficent.\n\nI think what you are missing in your rug example is it is more like paying some company to clean it up. I disagree the 'right' thing to do is clean it *yourself.* The right thing to do is clean it *period*. Whether that is yourself or paying someone else to do it for you. If the person in your example offered to pay Rug Cleaners Corp. to do it you really think the homeowner would not invite them back?\n\nI think you are seeing it as throwing money as some type of PR stunt.

Blockchains are 'immutable ledgers'. They are information that is virtually impossible to destroy.\n\nA transaction of cryptocurrency is just an entry in that ledger. The entry says something like 'Alice sends Bob 2 Bitcoin'. Because this record can't be changed, everyone now agrees that Bob has 2 bitcoin.\n\nHow does the entry get made? It gets written by people called miners. I like to think of miners as people who etch transactions in the stone of the blockchain. They chisel away letter by letter until the message is written in stone and no one can dispute it. It takes time and effort to chisel into stone, not to mention tools.\n\nSo if you, /u/Lifesaverscandy , want to send a transaction, you've got to pay a miner to chisel it in stone for you. Why would the miner do this? Two reasons. \n\nThe first reason: you pay them. You agree to let them take a bit of the money you send as payment. This is called a transaction fee.\n\nThe second reason: there are gems hidden in the stone. If the miner chisels a message for you, they'll find a little diamond embedded in the rock. This is called a block reward.\n\nBitcoin is designed so that the more you chisel into the rock, the fewer diamonds you'll find. Eventually, 100 years from now there won't be any diamonds left, just rock. At that point, the miners will rely completely on you paying them. This has a couple consequences. The first is that you might have to pay them more. The second is that fewer people might mine, or they won't chisel their messages as deep, making them easier to alter by would-be defacers. The advantage is that there won't be any inflation. \n\nEthereum, unlike bitcoin, decided that it would be more sustainable to embed diamonds all the way through the rock. This means we'll never get to a point where the miners will rely completely on commissions. The inflation in the system essentially subsidizes your cost to use the network while simultaneously ensuring that messages are engraved deeply enough. Ethereum can increase or decrease the amount of diamonds that will be found in order to fine tune the balance.\n\n\nNow. Everything I've said is accurate. But. It's all about to change. Because Ethereum has opted to stop using chisels altogether. Instead, they are going to try lazer engraving messages on the rock. How do you get a lazer engraver? Well, it turns out you can construct one by using diamonds to focus light. This is great because it means we don't rely on people with chisels any more. Instead of buying expensive third party equipment, now we can do the engraving ourselves. This is called a proof of stake system. The chisel method is called proof of work. \n\nI won't go any deeper than that. I hope that this metaphor shows the different design decisions that went into bitcoin and Ethereum, and some of the tradeoffs those decisions create","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To understand the answer to this question, you first have to understand a bit about how blockchains work.
