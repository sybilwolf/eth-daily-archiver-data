Whether you do believe in karma and want good things to come your way or if you're just a genuinely nice person who wants to make the world a better place, there are many benefits which can come from your generosity.\n\nToday I'll tell you my most recent story. Now I personally don't believe in karma but I really had to double think that belief today. Back in March and April of 2020, things were looking pretty bleak for many of us. Most of us were stuck inside, many of us were losing jobs and almost all of us lost 50% or more of our crypto net worth. Me? Well sure, I was down 50% on my ETH investment compared to last month but I was lucky enough to be working from home and still able to buy the dip. It was in this moment that I wanted to help those who weren't as fortunate as me. So I decided to give to some good causes. I sent some fiat to some local charities and I also decided to send some ETH to some of my favourite projects in the Ethereum and online privacy space. It wasn't much money as even now after ETH going more than 10x from then, I am far from being as stacked as some of the high rollers who hang out in this sub. However, I felt I was doing my part. But here's the thing: I didn't want to reveal my cold storage Ethereum addresses to those who I was donating to. So I decided to use Tornado.cash, a decentralised Ethereum mixer which will break the chain of transfers you can follow to reveal where it came from.\n\nFast forward to 2 months ago and the Tornado team revealed that they are doing a governance token airdrop, weighted heavily to the OG users compared to recent users. Awesome! In the next few weeks waiting for tokens to be made tradeable, I did some napkin math on how much I thought they might be worth. I was expecting maybe about $1,000 for my TORN tokens. Well I woke up this morning eager to check what they were selling for now that they are tradeable and imagine my disbelief when I see them trading for more than 5x what I was expecting! I sold them right away as I have noticed that airdrops tend to peak in price in the first few days before dropping.\n\nSo as a result of my generousity back in the depths of the 2020 bear, I have not only made back the opportunity cost of my donations to charity in fiat instead of buying the dip and the ETH I donated, but I have also pocketed a couple of ETH! I have since taken profits on some of that ETH to pay some bills and the I added 2 ETH to my stack.\n\nIn the long term, I intend to donate 5-10% of my profits to charities I like. However, I plan on doing most of this after I have cashed out a good chunk of my ETH (hopefully at the peak of this cycle) to diversify into other assets. I would encourage you all to do something similar too. Especially if you're a big fish. It could be good karma and benefit you later on. Or, it could be to simply make the world a better place. If you're one of the lucky few who will achieve financial freedom this run, philanthropy can also help to fill the void which many feel once they \"make it\". A lack of purpose is a surprisingly common issue faced by those who achieved their financial goals since now they have nowhere to focus their attention since making life-changing money is no longer a goal to work towards.\n\nWhatever your reasoning, whatever your financial status, please don't forget to think about others and be grateful for all of the opportunities you have been given. Why not give a little back to help spread the joy Ethereum has brought you with others who aren't as fortunate. Also, why not pass on the torch of giving which was passed to you by the generous devs UNI, 1Inch, Tornado cash and more?

That dream is within sight now.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of top notch charities I like to give to:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/\">Doctors Without Borders</a> -- one of the most efficient charities around, winner of a Nobel Prize for their work. These are doctors who risk their own lives to help the unfortunate around the world. I can&#39;t say enough good about this charity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ij.org/\">Institute For Justice</a> - A group that provides legal services to fight for economic and personal freedom for those who the system has forgotten. They have taken a number of cases to the Supreme Court. They spearheaded the nationwide reform of rules regarding eminent domain (see <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6726298/\">The Pink House</a> documentary) and are now waging a fight to get rid of ridiculous asset forfeiture laws.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-09 05:52:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gmp3by4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lfw0ve","parent_id":"t1_gmojxd2","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/shiftli","body":"Intersting, I also benefitted massively from airdrops I only received because I donated to gitcoin earlier.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Intersting, I also benefitted massively from airdrops I only received because I donated to gitcoin earlier.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-09 09:02:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gmprt5k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lfw0ve","parent_id":"t1_gmojxd2","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/243576809","body":"I'm on board! hope many others join in as well.\n\nI've saved this thread to come back to read other people's recomendations when I have more time (and more to give).\n\nI'm a fan of bail funds recently, largely because a donation goes further since money is returned to the fund if the case is won.

[Here's a live counter](https://web.gridplus.io/grid-token).\n\nGRID is  used with all of the technology and open standards put out by secure hardware manufacturer GridPlus, the first of which is energy. GridPlus is a hardware focused company and also it has a wholly owned retail energy subsidiary in Texas that has been operating for over two years now. The Lattice1 hardware is the cornerstone of the energy roadmap, but it's a general purpose tool and we've always considered energy the first real world demonstration of it.  \n\n\n**Energy**\n\nThe token's initial primary use is to give customers the right to 500kWh of energy at wholesale pricing without markup. Right now customers deposit GRID and it's applied to their bills automatically as they consume energy. The value varies according to both their rates and the price of energy on the open market.\n\nCustomers can pay their bills using traditional methods but we also accept ETH, DAI, BTC, and GRID.  If customers opt to pay with GRID, they get an additional discount. Each month a rate is set based on a multiple of the average spot rate over the prior month, denominated in kWh. This means that whatever the price is, customers are always incentivized to use crypto and realize a benefit. This is a floating rate set monthly at approximately 1.5x the prior month's average [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gridplus) price - so there's no cap on its value.  \n\n\n**Lattice1 Discount**  \n\n\nWe also offer a discount on the Lattice1 for redeeming GRID - right now that's $150 off for 150 GRID (currently around 17 cents each). Redeemed tokens are taken out of circulation and sent to the Ethereum burn address. This discount can and will change over time - it'll taper off and the discount for each GRID redeemed will adjust upward if the token does in order to make sure the discount remains appealing.  \n\n\n**Phonon Network**\n\nAn anticipated use case for the GRID token by Q3 of this year is for participating in a DAO to manage our off-chain hardware-enforced scaling system, [PhononDAO](https://blog.gridplus.io/introducing-phonon-dao-ce75bbefc5b2). We're well into the implementation of the spec and we believe it is important for GRID to be part of an open-source collective endeavor that others can get involved in.\n\nPhonon is an open standard for hardware-enforced off-chain payments that are fast, free, and private. Users only pay to wrap assets to use on Phonon and then to batch settle back on chain. The DAO would manage system parameters and revenue generated by the system.\n\nOnce a user pays to wrap any asset (ETH, ERC-20s, NFTs) they can store it on a GridPlus SafeCard or card from another hardware manufacturer (the DAO will manage which hardware to recognize) and it becomes a bearer instrument - you can instantly pass around this Phonon as many times as you want off-chain. Whoever is in possession of it at the end is the only one who is able to withdraw back onto the L1.\n\nWe're focused on technical implementation of the spec right now and are vetting external teams to help with the DAO framework and smart contract side. There are more details to be worked out for the DAO, but the closest token analogy would be something like Tornado Cash's TORN. \n\nIf you'd like to learn more, come join us on [our newly launched Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Bt5fVDTJb9)!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, Justin from <a href=\"https://gridplus.io/\">GridPlus</a>, I can explain a bit about GRID, how it&#39;s used by customers today and how that functionality is anticipated to expand this year.</p>\n\n<p>Energy subsidiary uses have been the primary driver till now, but I think what everyone on ETHFinance will be most excited about is <a href=\"https://github.com/GridPlus/phonon-network\">Phonon</a>, our open standard for wrapping Ethereum assets to be passed around off-chain like cash: private, fast, and free.</p>\n\n<p>We actually just crossed a milestone yesterday with customers redeeming over 300,000 GRID and removing it permanently from circulation. <a href=\"https://web.gridplus.io/grid-token\">Here&#39;s a live counter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>GRID is  used with all of the technology and open standards put out by secure hardware manufacturer GridPlus, the first of which is energy.

Not sure what they have that's actually *new*. \n\nA lot of their marketing literature says things like \"mathematically proven\" and similar things, trying to invoke the idea of something careful and rigorous.   But as the great computer scientist Donald Knuth said -- *\"Beware of bugs in the code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.\"*  To know whether something works takes much more than theory, it takes real world testing.  And they haven't even laid out critical parts of their framework yet, so to make promises on that level of overconfidence is concerning to me.\n\nThe smart contracts haven't rolled out yet, but they haven't revealed how they're going to get around the basic limitation that it costs CPU cycles to even evaluate a smart contract call, and that cost has to be borne out in fees somehow, or your network is open to DDoS.   The Ethereum developers are continually trying to squeeze all the efficiency they can out of that process to reduce fees where possible; Cardona has no core breakthrough I can find reference to that would give it a leg up in terms of efficiency there. \n\nThen there's their staking system -- they claim it's Proof of Stake proper, and \"better\" than Ethereum.  Yet the design has a fixed number of slots (or \"pools\"), and the leaders operating the pools must be \"reliable operators\" -- implying a much more permissioned system, ala Delegated Proof of Stake.  They have more slots (1000) than other systems like EOS (which has only 21), but I don't see how it's not prone to the same centralization incentives that such systems are prone to.  They have a \"saturation coeffcient\" which is supposed to encourage decentralization -- but their official staking operation [page](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-operation/) states that *\"The saturation mechanism was designed [...] to incentivize operators to set up alternative pools.\"* \n\nDPoS in general is a rather problematic architecture.  You have the ability to process things much faster and cheap, but it's a lot harder for anyone to run their own node; so things not only tend to be more centralized, but the surface area required to attack your network is fixed.  Not just fixed, but can't be self-expanding -- instead of someone seeing a gap in the decentralization, and running their own node to cover the gap, they have to convince enough other people, to convince the pool operator, to change their deployment strategy.\n\nAll in all, I don't see anything new; and the old bits that it's recycling seem to pick \"cheap and fast\" over \"good\" -- which is the exact opposite of what their marketing claims.   Maybe I'll be surprised, but I'm not bothering to spend my money on it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I get a couple of ... if not <em>red</em> flags from Cardano, a least a few yellow-orange ones.

And they haven&#39;t even laid out critical parts of their framework yet, so to make promises on that level of overconfidence is concerning to me.</p>\n\n<p>The smart contracts haven&#39;t rolled out yet, but they haven&#39;t revealed how they&#39;re going to get around the basic limitation that it costs CPU cycles to even evaluate a smart contract call, and that cost has to be borne out in fees somehow, or your network is open to DDoS.   The Ethereum developers are continually trying to squeeze all the efficiency they can out of that process to reduce fees where possible; Cardona has no core breakthrough I can find reference to that would give it a leg up in terms of efficiency there. </p>\n\n<p>Then there&#39;s their staking system -- they claim it&#39;s Proof of Stake proper, and &quot;better&quot; than Ethereum.  Yet the design has a fixed number of slots (or &quot;pools&quot;), and the leaders operating the pools must be &quot;reliable operators&quot; -- implying a much more permissioned system, ala Delegated Proof of Stake.  They have more slots (1000) than other systems like EOS (which has only 21), but I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s not prone to the same centralization incentives that such systems are prone to.  They have a &quot;saturation coeffcient&quot; which is supposed to encourage decentralization -- but their official staking operation <a href=\"https://cardano.org/stake-pool-operation/\">page</a> states that <em>&quot;The saturation mechanism was designed [...] to incentivize operators to set up alternative pools.&quot;</em> </p>\n\n<p>DPoS in general is a rather problematic architecture.  You have the ability to process things much faster and cheap, but it&#39;s a lot harder for anyone to run their own node; so things not only tend to be more centralized, but the surface area required to attack your network is fixed.  Not just fixed, but can&#39;t be self-expanding -- instead of someone seeing a gap in the decentralization, and running their own node to cover the gap, they have to convince enough other people, to convince the pool operator, to change their deployment strategy.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I don&#39;t see anything new; and the old bits that it&#39;s recycling seem to pick &quot;cheap and fast&quot; over &quot;good&quot; -- which is the exact opposite of what their marketing claims.   Maybe I&#39;ll be surprised, but I&#39;m not bothering to spend my money on it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-09 08:02:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gmpjfz9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lfw0ve","parent_id":"t1_gmpfrmx","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/El_Reconquista","body":"This is one of the best critique posts on Cardano I've read so far, thank you.
