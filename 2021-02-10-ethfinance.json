I never compared ETH to anything else and anything else also having risk doesn't reduce the risk for Ethereum.\n\nMy point is that this is not a rational risk/reward analysis, but an emotional analysis based on familiarity. Apple products are not risk free; they won't recover your data and are known to often not work as well as advertised. But they are familiar and familiar products can have a much higher risk and lower reward profile than an unfamiliar one because that's just how human psychology ticks.\n\n> Absolutely true, if the updates go as intended.\n\nWhile I agree with the rough premise that a successful ETH 2.0 can command a much higher price tag than ETH 1.0, I disagree with the assumption that we are necessarily at or over ETH 1.0's fair market valuation. That does not follow. The majority of ETH's functionality comes from smart contracts and Dapps.

CB intergration with loopring would appear in the form of going on the CBPro iface and when you click &quot;withdraw&quot; there&#39;d be the option to &quot;send to Ethereum (Layer 1)&quot;, &quot;send to Loopring on Ethereum (Layer 2)&quot;, &quot;send to OVM on Ethereum (Layer 2)&quot;</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-10 13:31:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gmv4zz1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lgnaua","parent_id":"t1_gmv1p06","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/argbarman2","body":"Yep see my comment below on that (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lgnaua/daily_general_discussion_february_10_2021/gmv5cmk/?context=3)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yep see my comment below on that (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lgnaua/daily_general_discussion_february_10_2021/gmv5cmk/?context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lgnaua/daily_general_discussion_february_10_2021/gmv5cmk/?context=3</a>)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-10 13:36:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gmv5m62","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lgnaua","parent_id":"t1_gmv4zz1","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/decibels42","body":"I think that the first exchange that realizes that it\u2019s best bet into the future is to embrace DeFi and support its protocols, as the \u201czerion\u201d of centralized companies, will do very very well.

I currently have 0.95 ETH and about $400 in 4 other, smaller coins. I am using money I won&#39;t miss too much but I am planning to likely sell everything I have and use the profits for a mortgage deposit, if the bull run continues for a while and the profits are substantial (if it ends early and the profits are smaller I&#39;ll probably hold the coins for the future).</p>\n\n<p>What I am wondering is, would I be better off in risking more and reinvesting 0.5ETH in a series of smaller coins that can gain way more value, but can also fail more easily? We have all seen the $10k predictions for ETH but realistically I think it will be much less, so perhaps it might be worth the risk and diversifying a little bit more?</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of that I want to invest more in crypto throughout the next few years, but also have the short term plan that I need to focus on (and yes, we need to get the mortgage this year if that matters).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-09 23:43:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gmsmv3q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lgnaua","parent_id":"t3_lgnaua","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Captain_Swuf","body":"Hello, how much do you actually 'need' this money for the mortgage deposit?
