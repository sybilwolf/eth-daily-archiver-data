You pay tax on the value when you earn it, and then you pay tax on the appreciation between when you earned it and when you sold it.  If you sell it immediately that&#39;s basically zero.  The first taxable event (earning the interest) will be standard income.  The second taxable event will either be short term or long term cap gains depending on how long you hold it before you sell.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-12 11:16:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gn39sku","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_li50pk","parent_id":"t1_gn358cs","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Mike_WardAllOneWord","body":"These are definitely some murky waters.

We know that 10% of RPL tokens will be required to operate a node. If we assume that rocketpool adds 2 Million ETH to the beacon chain (something feasible when people without 32 ETH begin to deposit), then that implies that at least 200,000 worth of ETH in RPL must be staked with every node. \n\nSo every node operator for rocketpool can stake between 10% and potentially up to 150% (of RPL) but let\u2019s assume 10% for the sake of simplicity. This means that the market cap for Rocketpool will essentially become tied to ETH in order to maintain that collateralization. \n\nIf we take our 200,000 ether equivalent protocol wide requirement, our RPL marketcap (based on the price of ether at writing) is 372 Million. This is simplifying things enormously but it\u2019s essentially the theoretical floor. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the fact that some may opt to put in 25% worth in RPL (to earn rewards and speculate on protocol growth). It would be interesting to see a feature whereby if RPL increases to 30% in a huge price increase, that automatically sells the 20% increase in price for some rETH. Essentially lifting the minimum protocol wide RPL collateral requirement and establishing a new floor. Granted ETH could go down, but it\u2019s a long term type of play. I\u2019m talking about institutions here. \n\nFinal point. If Doge has taught me anything it\u2019s that a rocket emoji will not hurt the price of RPL. \n\nI think at this point rocketpool is one of the better bets in the space with a realistic risk-reward ratio. It will essentially always have to maintain 10% of however much ether is staked in the protocol. Since this protocol opens up staking to everyone with rETH tokens I predict a Uniswap ETH-rETH pool will become very very attractive as it will minimize divergent loss. \n\nThoughts?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So pacing around and talking to myself I\u2019ve come up with an interesting thesis, and now it\u2019s time for some hole poking. </p>\n\n<p>Rocketpool is coming.

The contract is growing. In the past day it grew by 60 million dai, a 3% growth. 3% daily growth corresponds to like 400x (that&#39;s 400x, not +400%) annual growth.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, grain of salt: 3% growth is above average for maker, this growth is connected to eth growth, it&#39;s not guaranteed to continue long term, and there is nothing concrete preventing it from shrinking instead of growing.</p>\n\n<p>But still, it&#39;s grown like 16x in the past 12 months, about 1.72x since jan 1st 21 (that&#39;s about 100x growth annualized). This growth is absolutely insane. If it keeps up even slightly, this asset is undervalued by at least 10x, purely based on fundamentals. And crypto is known to pump assets till they&#39;re <em>overvalued</em> not undervalued.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer, between 5% and 10% of my portfolio is maker currently.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-12 06:34:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gn280zn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_li50pk","parent_id":"t1_gn23vzs","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"Maker, well any DEFI really","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Maker, well any DEFI really</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-12 06:20:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gn26bjf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_li50pk","parent_id":"t1_gn23vzs","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/tslabtc","body":"The lowest caps will rise the greatest %, but will be the hardest to time and get out of in time.
