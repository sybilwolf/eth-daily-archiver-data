Your mined ether would also appreciate in value.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The real reason why EIP-1559 is important to Ethereum is</strong> <strong><em>not</em></strong> <strong>because it will drive up the price of ETH but because it will increase the usability of the network.</strong> It will make the transaction fees more predictable and stable and therefore eliminate the need to manually adjust gas fees in wallets which is a big problem for new users and therefor adoption.</p>\n\n<p>The last thing I would like to address are the statements on your site about ETH 2.0.From the very beginning of Ethereum it was planned that the chain will switch over to Proof Of Stake once it is ready. So why are you surprised and mad about that?

My uncle has been a really good resource lately now that my investments are starting to pay off, so I&#39;ll likely be consulting him in the near future, too, to get some guidance before I start cashing anything out, buying a house, or making any major financial decisions. My dad did well, and understands more... I guess the &quot;accountant&quot; aspects of economics, but I wouldn&#39;t go to him for too much economic advice outside of that. </p>\n\n<p>He managed to do well more just through his profession, which started with his own business (pharmacy) that he eventually sold, but other than that, he didn&#39;t really do anything to build wealth (outside of the typical; owning a house, career with a pension, etc). He&#39;s fine, but he could have been <em>wayyyy</em> better off. Hell, he retired a couple years ago in his mid 60s (and was always a &quot;I don&#39;t ever want to retire/I&#39;ll be bored if I&#39;m not active,&quot; type of person), and I was trying sooooo hard to convince him to work just 1 more year, telling him I could turn 2/3rds of 1 year of his salary into at least 2-3 times that lol, but he had no interest and just doesn&#39;t want <em>anything</em> to do with any kind of financial risk. I recently showed him what it&#39;d have been worth now (over 2 million... far more than I promised \u2014 more just because of luck, as it&#39;d have aligned with ~$80 ETH on the timeline) and he wasn&#39;t even phased - bothered me more than him lol.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-13 14:02:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gnaut9l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_liulbp","parent_id":"t1_gn9ut8y","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Heringsalat100","body":">Just having a home with no payments, means I'm in a really good position.

We're a long way from adequate, but we'll get there. \n\nThe nuance of this is frequently lost on the broader compliance community. Just getting past the \"crypto is for criminals\" narrative is a big step. Recognizing crypto assets as valuable components of a modern economy is another. And embracing smart contracts will be absolutely radical. \n\nAnd while the very nature of decentralization makes it inherently more complicated to regulate, it's not an impossible task. I appreciate that we have some folks in government who are trying to learn how instead of just grabbing the banhammer.\n\nI see a lot of anti-regulation sentiment in the sub, but I firmly believe we can advocate for smart regulations that will help the crypto sector thrive as we go mainstream. \n\nCan you imagine an organization with the size and resources of, say, the CDC dedicated solely to advancing the state of blockchain technology? DARPA gave us the Internet.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In the nearly 4 years I have followed crypto, I never heard of Crypto Mom at the SEC, but this popped up today:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/html/news/clear-crypto-rules-urgently-needed-192644366.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/html/news/clear-crypto-rules-urgently-needed-192644366.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Smack on the money, Crypto Mom. As institutional investment takes off, we&#39;re hindering the ability of American businesses to stay on the cutting edge by failing to provide a consistent regulatory climate for cryptocurrency. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d add that as the space matures, I think smart regulation will be a huge boon to the crypto market. There&#39;s a huge section of the market that still sees all crypto as Bitcoin, and Bitcoin as that anonymous internet money you buy drugs and hire hit men with.</p>\n\n<p>Some clear and crypto-savvy rules from the SEC will help us embrace those retail refugees with open arms as the space gains in legitimacy, but more importantly, we need consumer protections if decentralized finance can ever reasonably service something as diverse and massive as the US economy.</p>\n\n<p>Your grandma should be able to use services like Aave in 5 years, and do so in a world where there&#39;s a safety net in place for her life savings.</p>\n\n<p>The Ethereum community is busy building that safety net right now, using new systems of governance to devise game-theoretically optimal mechanism designs and decentralized insurance. We&#39;re a long way from adequate, but we&#39;ll get there. </p>\n\n<p>The nuance of this is frequently lost on the broader compliance community. Just getting past the &quot;crypto is for criminals&quot; narrative is a big step. Recognizing crypto assets as valuable components of a modern economy is another. And embracing smart contracts will be absolutely radical. </p>\n\n<p>And while the very nature of decentralization makes it inherently more complicated to regulate, it&#39;s not an impossible task. I appreciate that we have some folks in government who are trying to learn how instead of just grabbing the banhammer.</p>\n\n<p>I see a lot of anti-regulation sentiment in the sub, but I firmly believe we can advocate for smart regulations that will help the crypto sector thrive as we go mainstream. </p>\n\n<p>Can you imagine an organization with the size and resources of, say, the CDC dedicated solely to advancing the state of blockchain technology?
