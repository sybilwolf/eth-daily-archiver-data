There is ongoing discussion about this in the Eth R&D Discord - the consideration is around how long the upgrade needs to be on the various testnets prior to launch.

London timings are [currently being spitballed.](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245)\n\nThe big Eth2 items - HF1, the merge and sharding - are all still on track as per previous updates.

When info comes to light I will add it here.\n\nUniswap rumours - lots of discussion this week about the notion that Uniswap is likely to launch its v3 upgrade *without* rollups included. The reasoning being if they are ready with everything else why not just launch it, then upgrade again when rollups are ready. Slightly disappointing if true, but if it's not ready, it's not ready. Cannot come too soon though with gas fees the way they are.\n\n\u2014\n\n**TIMELINE**\n\nAll dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.

I&#39;m going to keep the date here as March until a change is officially confirmed.</p>\n\n<p>After Berlin, the next Eth1 upgrade (codenamed London) is tentatively scheduled for mid-2021 and <strong>should,</strong> all going well, include EIP-1559. London timings are <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245\">currently being spitballed.</a></p>\n\n<p>The big Eth2 items - HF1, the merge and sharding - are all still on track as per previous updates. There was a positive <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lheavg/daily_general_discussion_february_11_2021/gmxwl0s/\">Eth2 devs call this week</a> with no big issues raised.</p>\n\n<p>Rocketpool <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lheavg/daily_general_discussion_february_11_2021/gn0s48a/\">still confident</a> that their launch is on track for March.</p>\n\n<p>In Layer 2 news, <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/\">Matic has rebranded to Polygon.</a> Not sure what this means roadmap wise but they have their own Optimistic and ZK rollups solutions planned. When info comes to light I will add it here.</p>\n\n<p>Uniswap rumours - lots of discussion this week about the notion that Uniswap is likely to launch its v3 upgrade <em>without</em> rollups included. The reasoning being if they are ready with everything else why not just launch it, then upgrade again when rollups are ready. Slightly disappointing if true, but if it&#39;s not ready, it&#39;s not ready. Cannot come too soon though with gas fees the way they are.</p>\n\n<p>\u2014</p>\n\n<p><strong>TIMELINE</strong></p>\n\n<p>All dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.

Spread it; otherwise, we will lose the war between miners and speculators.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>All of this while also publicly supporting any proposal that rewards miners without consideration of Ethereum&#39;s overall chain health - such as <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3143-increase-block-rewards-to-5-eth/5061\">EIP-3143</a> that looks to increase the block reward from 2 to 5. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/l1u2pa/support_eip3143_to_compensate_for_reduced_fee/gk1kq29?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">(Flexpool&#39;s support here)</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>You can see Flexpool&#39;s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2btor?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"><strong>response to my initial posting of this here (as well as mine and others replies that went un-answered).</strong></a> I strongly encourage everyone on this sub to read as I believe shows just how much doublespeak is going on between their &quot;in public&quot; attitude of compromise and their FUDing within the miner communities. If I can quote one thing that I felt was most impactful, read this sentence and take 30 seconds to reflect on where their motivations lie:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1559 hurts only one party so it\u2019s fair that another change be made that helps reduce the impact, <strong>especially when that change only benefits ETH.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&quot;Especially when that change only benefits ETH&quot; really speaks to what the priority is. And as you will note - when addressed on this issue, they remained silent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remember: Every single mining pool on that site that has not directly denounced Flexpool&#39;s actions is functionally support this type of behavior.</strong> <strong>Their silence is signaling approval of these actions.</strong> Which as of today includes: Spark Pool / Etheremine / Nanopool / Hiveon / 2Miners / Ezil / Ethashpool / WoolyPooly / Crazypool</p>\n\n<p><em>I am posting this as I believe this is that important for the devs / dapps &amp; exchanges / other miners / the community to see - emphasis on Tim and the other devs that are going to be on the EIP 1559 panel. Please do understand this is for informational purposes and is NOT a call to directly brigade / attack / instigate Flexpool in poor taste.

This is US centric.\n\nYou can back some of your gains into a Roth IRA! Up to $58,000 a year total in tax advantage retirement accounts through a Mega Back Door Roth IRA.\n\nTo do this you'll need to be working at a employer that offers a 401K with after tax contributions that you are allowed to withdraw from. May work better with a Roth 401K depending on state tax law.\n\nHow to do this:\n\n1. Max out your 401K contributions up to $58,000 a year.\n2. Live off your crypto gains during this time.\n3. Rollover the 401K after tax contribution  in excess of $19,500 into a Roth IRA\n\nAnd that's it! The advantages of this is that your investments can grow tax free. You will be able to withdraw the principal at any time later. You can do this for multiple years for as long as you like (as long as the rules governing Roth IRAs are left unchanged)\n\nThe down side is that the earned interest cannot be withdrawn until age 59.5 without penalty.\n\nHere's a site that explains it:\n\n[https://thecollegeinvestor.com/17561/understanding-the-mega-backdoor-roth-ira/](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/17561/understanding-the-mega-backdoor-roth-ira/)\n\nOther tax tricks to reduce your crypto tax burden:\n\n* Purchase Greyscale ETHE in a Roth IRA account. All gains will be tax free. This assumes that you believe ETH will continue to run up in price.\n* Offset some of your taxes by deferring your taxes by maxing out contribution to Traditional IRA/401K up to a maximum of 25,500. (downside is these funds are inaccessible until 59.5 years of age without penalty).\n* Move somewhere with tax favorable treatment. This includes moving to a state without state income taxes, Puerto Rico for no federal income taxes, or even out of the country. This one may be tricky as you technically are on the hook for all assets prior to moving for federal income taxes. Regarding state rules it may vary state to state.\n* Holding a coin for more than 1 year gives you long term capital gain tax treatment which is taxed lower than short term capital gains.\n* Loss harvesting by selling investments that suffered a loss to offset gains.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, wanted to share tax saving trick to save you more once you cash out your phat ETH gains!

This assumes that you believe ETH will continue to run up in price.</li>\n<li>Offset some of your taxes by deferring your taxes by maxing out contribution to Traditional IRA/401K up to a maximum of 25,500. (downside is these funds are inaccessible until 59.5 years of age without penalty).</li>\n<li>Move somewhere with tax favorable treatment. This includes moving to a state without state income taxes, Puerto Rico for no federal income taxes, or even out of the country. This one may be tricky as you technically are on the hook for all assets prior to moving for federal income taxes. Regarding state rules it may vary state to state.</li>\n<li>Holding a coin for more than 1 year gives you long term capital gain tax treatment which is taxed lower than short term capital gains.</li>\n<li>Loss harvesting by selling investments that suffered a loss to offset gains.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-14 08:32:32","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-02-14 10:19:06","id":"gnfj863","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ljiplj","parent_id":"t3_ljiplj","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/oldskool47","body":"Don't forget about the gift tax!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Don&#39;t forget about the gift tax!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-14 08:43:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gnfm4m4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ljiplj","parent_id":"t1_gnfj863","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Best_coder_NA","body":"How do you take advantage of this?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How do you take advantage of this?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-14 09:49:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gng3v3v","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ljiplj","parent_id":"t1_gnfm4m4","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/oldskool47","body":"[This link will help](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/gift-tax-rate).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/gift-tax-rate\">This link will help</a>.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-14 09:56:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gng5fmg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ljiplj","parent_id":"t1_gng3v3v","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/ridgerunners","body":"I\u2019m a little confused on how this loophole will help us avoid taxes on crypto gains.

If you do nothing, and when the chains merge, your coins are subject to a compulsory upgrade because the whole network is being migrated and the old one will cease to exist, that\u2019s much much less of a tax event, for me.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-14 09:00:45","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-02-14 09:05:40","id":"gnfpttk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ljiplj","parent_id":"t1_gnfo6o5","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/decibels42","body":"Does anyone have a link or name of the recent Chamath podcast where he talked about NFTs?

In the blockchain space, you need to understand the technology to start to be able to judge. \n2) Is your friend technical ?\n3) If you are both technical, you should be able to argue what are the pros and cons of each chain and judge accordingly. \n\nNow, my point of view. I am well versed in computer science, mathematics and finance, so I think I somewhat check the above bowes, although I could definitely be more expert than I am on all blockchain technologies. \n\n1) Starting with the teams. Vitalik is the real deal. Medal at the mathematics olympiads, followed the btc tech at the beginning, son of a computer programmer who is a serial entrepreneur, known to be super smart. He is also no bullshit. I know quite a bit this kind of profile, and simply put, they are the smartest / most technically qualified lot. They also usually do not like marketing. For Charles Hoskinson, I honestly don't know. He is supposed yo be a math PhD, but actually can't find his PhD thesis online, does someone have a link ? I would probably be a le to judge if he is a serious mathematician or not by readin it. From the only videos I've seen, he was surprisingly.... normal. Felt to le that if he did do some research stuff before, he definitely seems to have worked on his sales skills / communication skills. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, this means that he definitely has the potential to persuade gullible people. I see this as a potentially small red flag. Listen to Vitalik, you'll definitely see this guy is not a salesman. He is tech, tech, tech, and that is what he loves. \n\n2) On the persona. Charles Hoskinson has shared some technical numbers that were seriously misleading. He posted on twitter that more value is transacted on Cardano than on Ethereum, where this is only because Cardano is Utxo based. Basically on eth, when you send 1 eth, it counds as 1 eth. From what I understand, on Cardano, if you send 1 ada from an account holding 1 million ada, he counted it as \"1 million ada\". Only 2 possibilities. 1) He has no technical knowledge and is basically a fraud (unlikely). 2) He knows this is misleading and willingly missleads / manipulates people. This is a serious red flag. From people that worked with him at the beginning of ethereum, 2) seems very likely. \n\n2) I do not see what Cardano's \"big improvements\" are. They have pos or dpos ? They invented none of it. At least the founder of Eos actually was a pioneer on dpos. For pos, 90% of the research done on it actually comes from ethereum researchers. Dpos has proved unreliable with eos. Pos will come with eth 2.0, as well as sharding. At the beginning, the main point of ada was \"programs can be formally verified\". That at least was somewhat \"different\" (I won't say innovative, as formally verified programs have been implemented and developed for 30 years). However, there is a big big big downside to programming \"verifiable programs\": it is too difficult for 99% of programmers. Compared to what it brings, this is the reason why it id in practice... well not used, except in some niche industries. \n\n3) There is a balance between network effect and \"quantity of innovation\" brought by a competing technology. At first, btc was king. Many competitors arrives, with \"small\" improvements (ltc, dogecoin...). However, none of these have gained traction: network effect > small improvements. Then came Ethereum. Now, you don't just have a calculator, you have a full computer. This is a BIG step. And then Eth became number 2 (and I bet at some point number 1). In this case, we actually had big leap improvement > network effect. Currently, all the eth killers seem to be \"small improvements\". This won't beat eth. If you want to beat eth, you actually need a \"0 to 1\" kind of improvement. Solving the trilemma would do this. But Ada definitely doesn't. \n\nThat is my take. But market can stay irrational quite long. I don't care, I like market competition, and I'm in for the long haul.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>1) Are you technical (like a real computer science geek). In the blockchain space, you need to understand the technology to start to be able to judge. \n2) Is your friend technical ?\n3) If you are both technical, you should be able to argue what are the pros and cons of each chain and judge accordingly. </p>\n\n<p>Now, my point of view. I am well versed in computer science, mathematics and finance, so I think I somewhat check the above bowes, although I could definitely be more expert than I am on all blockchain technologies. </p>\n\n<p>1) Starting with the teams. Vitalik is the real deal. Medal at the mathematics olympiads, followed the btc tech at the beginning, son of a computer programmer who is a serial entrepreneur, known to be super smart. He is also no bullshit. I know quite a bit this kind of profile, and simply put, they are the smartest / most technically qualified lot. They also usually do not like marketing. For Charles Hoskinson, I honestly don&#39;t know. He is supposed yo be a math PhD, but actually can&#39;t find his PhD thesis online, does someone have a link ? I would probably be a le to judge if he is a serious mathematician or not by readin it. From the only videos I&#39;ve seen, he was surprisingly.... normal. Felt to le that if he did do some research stuff before, he definitely seems to have worked on his sales skills / communication skills. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, this means that he definitely has the potential to persuade gullible people. I see this as a potentially small red flag. Listen to Vitalik, you&#39;ll definitely see this guy is not a salesman. He is tech, tech, tech, and that is what he loves. </p>\n\n<p>2) On the persona. Charles Hoskinson has shared some technical numbers that were seriously misleading. He posted on twitter that more value is transacted on Cardano than on Ethereum, where this is only because Cardano is Utxo based. Basically on eth, when you send 1 eth, it counds as 1 eth. From what I understand, on Cardano, if you send 1 ada from an account holding 1 million ada, he counted it as &quot;1 million ada&quot;. Only 2 possibilities. 1) He has no technical knowledge and is basically a fraud (unlikely). 2) He knows this is misleading and willingly missleads / manipulates people. This is a serious red flag. From people that worked with him at the beginning of ethereum, 2) seems very likely. </p>\n\n<p>2) I do not see what Cardano&#39;s &quot;big improvements&quot; are. They have pos or dpos ?
