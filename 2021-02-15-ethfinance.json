This means there\u2019s likely an increasing disconnect between central bank policy and down stream effects. Or at best it is getting harder to be confident that interventions will have a desired effect.</p></li>\n<li><p>Blockchain based stable coins have the potential to simultaneously solve issues around transparency, settlement, and systemic collateralisation/leverage risks. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Really interested to hear others\u2019 thoughts on the conversations in this episode.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-15 05:47:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gnj7wwr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lk75ej","parent_id":"t3_lk75ej","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/KuDeTa","body":"Here's another interesting tidbit: draft executable beacon chain spec - aka *turning off POW and using POS.*\n\n[https://hackmd.io/QFm6Ih\\_-Si6\\_kSLCWTZQyw](https://hackmd.io/QFm6Ih_-Si6_kSLCWTZQyw)\n\nI wonder if the miners will continue to bother fighting 1559 with this not so far away.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s another interesting tidbit: draft executable beacon chain spec - aka <em>turning off POW and using POS.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/QFm6Ih_-Si6_kSLCWTZQyw\">https://hackmd.io/QFm6Ih_-Si6_kSLCWTZQyw</a></p>\n\n<p>I wonder if the miners will continue to bother fighting 1559 with this not so far away.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-15 09:40:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gnjyakx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lk75ej","parent_id":"t3_lk75ej","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Sfdao91","body":"gonna implement it in my custom node, so I can start validating eth1 blocks in an hour. brb","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>gonna implement it in my custom node, so I can start validating eth1 blocks in an hour. brb</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-15 10:20:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gnk3fdn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lk75ej","parent_id":"t1_gnjyakx","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/defewit","body":"My wife came up with a brilliant idea after discussing the recent news that the creator of nyancat is making a one-of-a-kind NFT token.\n\nWhat about a similar NFT token of the Doge meme?

It has built up enormous network effects and is the platform of choice for users and developers alike: we\u2019ve seen the value of this with the rise of DeFi this year. It has enormous ecosystem support: exchanges, wallets, fiat providers - even regulators are very familiar with Ethereum and how to interface with it. Building all this infrastructure from scratch (while Ethereum continues to improve) will be very challenging.\u00a0\u200dFurther, we believe that Ethereum best represents the philosophy of trustless, decentralized asset ownership. It has consistently prioritized decentralization and network health over short-term scalability upgrades. Ethereum is largely community developed, and multiple healthy clients are available - all of this means that your assets are safer. **There\u2019s no point owning blockchain assets if they can be lost or seized at any point.\u200dPut simply, if you\u2019re building an NFT project, you want to be on Ethereum**. Immutable X lets projects stay on Ethereum while massively boosting their scalability and liquidity, and we\u2019re enormously excited to tell the world about it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Im not gonna lie.

Why the fuck have a blockchain in the first place? They may as well use a database.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: FROM the <a href=\"https://Immutable.com\">Immutable.com</a> FAQ - Emphasis mine.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Ethereum and not a different blockchain (e.g. Flow, Tron, EOS)?</h2>\n\n<p>Ethereum is (by far) the largest smart contract blockchain in the world. It has built up enormous network effects and is the platform of choice for users and developers alike: we\u2019ve seen the value of this with the rise of DeFi this year. It has enormous ecosystem support: exchanges, wallets, fiat providers - even regulators are very familiar with Ethereum and how to interface with it. Building all this infrastructure from scratch (while Ethereum continues to improve) will be very challenging.\u00a0\u200dFurther, we believe that Ethereum best represents the philosophy of trustless, decentralized asset ownership. It has consistently prioritized decentralization and network health over short-term scalability upgrades. Ethereum is largely community developed, and multiple healthy clients are available - all of this means that your assets are safer. <strong>There\u2019s no point owning blockchain assets if they can be lost or seized at any point.\u200dPut simply, if you\u2019re building an NFT project, you want to be on Ethereum</strong>. Immutable X lets projects stay on Ethereum while massively boosting their scalability and liquidity, and we\u2019re enormously excited to tell the world about it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-15 18:15:09","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-02-15 19:11:16","id":"gnloalb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lk75ej","parent_id":"t3_lk75ej","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/argbarman2","body":"These NFT's are extremely illiquid and there is likely a lot of wash trading happening to drive up prices.
