I'm personally not aware that there was ever any belief that layer 1 would or could support a simply endless growth of transactions. Regardless, there is no mention of *why* fees are so high? How can this issue be discussed without talking about the underlying economic drivers? I.e. what are motivations for usage right now? Are these likely to remain the same going forward? This is bound to evolve in time. Another important point - *the most obvious* - is, how does the apparent success of a blockchain relate to throughput, capacity and fees? There is almost zero evidence that throughput even matters. We're sitting hearing watching BTC price rise and rise, while transaction fees are extremely high and functionality is poor. BCH, *quite literally is the closet chain to Bitcoin that Satoshi wrote about*, can handle vastly more transactions than BTC under essentially identical security and consensus mechanisms (i.e. mining has power can be switched between the two chains almost instantly), and look at it's price? It's virtually irrelevant (you think the ETH/BTC ratio is bad!). How do fees and throughput matter in this case?\n\nIf a platform is valuable, people will pay to use it. Don't be under any illusion that fees won't rise on all other chains. E.g. if there are opportunities to profit, people will fight for them and they will pay high fees and max out any capacity to realize those opportunities. Maybe I don't know enough about other platforms, but unless their capacity is literally infinite (is it?!), I don't see how they will ultimately avoid getting swamped. *It could well be that every single existing secure chain ultimately gets swamped*. Maybe \"the market\" genuinely wants centralized XRP style platforms, but I don't believe that. Edington himself opened his post by saying how much even the Ethereum roadmap had evolved over recent months, so really, who knows how things will evolve in the next 6, 12, 24 months? I don't hear a \"death knell\" or anything remotely like it.\n\nTo your final point: I've no idea how one can be on the look-out for better solutions. I was on the look out for better solutions when it became clear that the Bitcoin blocksize was not going to be increased and fees were already ridiculous (as they still are). I looked to Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash (two evolving platforms with a strategy) and moved investments accordingly. That was nearly 4 years ago, and look where we are. I don't regret that at all, but the motivation was exactly as you suggest, and, financially, it was the worst possible move. **There is simply no way to predict how this space will evolve.**","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>With respect, I think both Edington&#39;s short summary and the above discussion is superficial and probably misleading at best. I&#39;m personally not aware that there was ever any belief that layer 1 would or could support a simply endless growth of transactions. Regardless, there is no mention of <em>why</em> fees are so high? How can this issue be discussed without talking about the underlying economic drivers? I.e. what are motivations for usage right now? Are these likely to remain the same going forward? This is bound to evolve in time. Another important point - <em>the most obvious</em> - is, how does the apparent success of a blockchain relate to throughput, capacity and fees? There is almost zero evidence that throughput even matters. We&#39;re sitting hearing watching BTC price rise and rise, while transaction fees are extremely high and functionality is poor. BCH, <em>quite literally is the closet chain to Bitcoin that Satoshi wrote about</em>, can handle vastly more transactions than BTC under essentially identical security and consensus mechanisms (i.e. mining has power can be switched between the two chains almost instantly), and look at it&#39;s price? It&#39;s virtually irrelevant (you think the ETH/BTC ratio is bad!). How do fees and throughput matter in this case?</p>\n\n<p>If a platform is valuable, people will pay to use it. Don&#39;t be under any illusion that fees won&#39;t rise on all other chains. E.g. if there are opportunities to profit, people will fight for them and they will pay high fees and max out any capacity to realize those opportunities. Maybe I don&#39;t know enough about other platforms, but unless their capacity is literally infinite (is it?!), I don&#39;t see how they will ultimately avoid getting swamped. <em>It could well be that every single existing secure chain ultimately gets swamped</em>. Maybe &quot;the market&quot; genuinely wants centralized XRP style platforms, but I don&#39;t believe that. Edington himself opened his post by saying how much even the Ethereum roadmap had evolved over recent months, so really, who knows how things will evolve in the next 6, 12, 24 months? I don&#39;t hear a &quot;death knell&quot; or anything remotely like it.</p>\n\n<p>To your final point: I&#39;ve no idea how one can be on the look-out for better solutions. I was on the look out for better solutions when it became clear that the Bitcoin blocksize was not going to be increased and fees were already ridiculous (as they still are).

Ethereum researchers and developers are working on issues that don't yet have clear solutions.  This means that even the best minds in the field often change their approach as they learn more.  Far from being a bad thing, this is evidence of continued flexibility and improvement.  \n\nAs someone heavily invested in ETH, my attention is on overall activity within the Ethereum community, not the latest roadmap changes.  I was disappointed when the initial PoS plans were scrapped in 2018, but it was the right decision.  Similarly, it was a letdown when I read about sharded execuction being put on the back burner (months ago!), but there were compelling reasons to do it.  The primary focus now appears to be facilitating L2s and the merge, which I think is appropriate.  As mentioned by Ben in his post, an encouraging aspect of the roadmap is that phases can be developed and deployed in parallel.  \n\nRather than dismissing planned improvements with an attitude of \"we're only getting L2 rollups, PoS consensus, and data sharding,\" I think we should celebrate how far we've come.  Rollups and sharding will dramatically increase network throughput, even if it takes time to efficiently employ the new capabilities.  In a world increasingly concerned with carbon emissions, distributed PoS is of enormous importance.  After the merge, Bitcoin on PoW will become questionable, perhaps even shameful.  PoW is a beautiful invention, but it belongs in a museum.  With a viable alternative, who'll want to be associated with something so consciously wasteful?  \n\nAny useful innovation in crypto research is immediately available to all.  As new techniques are developed, Ethereum will incorporate them.  A large number of projects are competing to achieve meaningful progress on the blockchain trilemma.  Many of them will grow exponentially.  Some will grow faster than Ethereum, even if they plateau at a smaller size.  The important thing is having a growing community of like-minded people working together to build public goods; in this respect, Ethereum is without peer.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>One thing that&#39;s become apparent over the course of Ethereum&#39;s journey is that roadmaps and solutions evolve, especially when they address open, difficult problems.

Far from being a bad thing, this is evidence of continued flexibility and improvement.  </p>\n\n<p>As someone heavily invested in ETH, my attention is on overall activity within the Ethereum community, not the latest roadmap changes.  I was disappointed when the initial PoS plans were scrapped in 2018, but it was the right decision.  Similarly, it was a letdown when I read about sharded execuction being put on the back burner (months ago!), but there were compelling reasons to do it.  The primary focus now appears to be facilitating L2s and the merge, which I think is appropriate.  As mentioned by Ben in his post, an encouraging aspect of the roadmap is that phases can be developed and deployed in parallel.  </p>\n\n<p>Rather than dismissing planned improvements with an attitude of &quot;we&#39;re only getting L2 rollups, PoS consensus, and data sharding,&quot; I think we should celebrate how far we&#39;ve come.  Rollups and sharding will dramatically increase network throughput, even if it takes time to efficiently employ the new capabilities.  In a world increasingly concerned with carbon emissions, distributed PoS is of enormous importance.  After the merge, Bitcoin on PoW will become questionable, perhaps even shameful.  PoW is a beautiful invention, but it belongs in a museum.  With a viable alternative, who&#39;ll want to be associated with something so consciously wasteful?  </p>\n\n<p>Any useful innovation in crypto research is immediately available to all.  As new techniques are developed, Ethereum will incorporate them.  A large number of projects are competing to achieve meaningful progress on the blockchain trilemma.  Many of them will grow exponentially.  Some will grow faster than Ethereum, even if they plateau at a smaller size.  The important thing is having a growing community of like-minded people working together to build public goods; in this respect, Ethereum is without peer.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-16 08:23:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gnnrumy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lkxcln","parent_id":"t3_lkxcln","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/throwawayrandomvowel","body":"[tldr](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/rickandmorty/images/9/9f/Scjerry.png/revision/latest?cb=20160111021222)\n\nAll this bombastic onanism feels like coping method for dealing with years of delays, death by committee, and technocratic gridlock.

L2 will almost certainly be able to offer cheaper and faster transactions, even than a fully scalable ETH 2.0 could have, so if it is difficult to implement it is the logical thing to drop. The downside is that many L2 solutions are basically not ready, either, and they are collectively adding significantly to the ecosystem's complexity and learning curve.\n\nThis puts a lot of onus on the community for explaining L2 solutions and disseminating the tools to use them--a difficult task considering most L2s are still unfinished--but this is also the community that came up with CryptoZombies. \n\nMy major concern with L2 solutions is that having a wide variety of L2 solutions makes it really easy for Ethereum to accumulate a ton of technical debt.

L2 will almost certainly be able to offer cheaper and faster transactions, even than a fully scalable ETH 2.0 could have, so if it is difficult to implement it is the logical thing to drop. The downside is that many L2 solutions are basically not ready, either, and they are collectively adding significantly to the ecosystem&#39;s complexity and learning curve.</p>\n\n<p>This puts a lot of onus on the community for explaining L2 solutions and disseminating the tools to use them--a difficult task considering most L2s are still unfinished--but this is also the community that came up with CryptoZombies. </p>\n\n<p>My major concern with L2 solutions is that having a wide variety of L2 solutions makes it really easy for Ethereum to accumulate a ton of technical debt.
