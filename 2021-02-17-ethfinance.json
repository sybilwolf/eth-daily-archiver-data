Tim is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1361056320703500290\">trying to count how many times #supportEIP1559 has been tweeted</a> as well as retweeting many of the projects that have shown support on this twitter page. I also am aware of others involved with Ethereum trying to get good data on support for the project - not just for fun, <strong>but to bring the data to dev calls.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The dev community is taking notice, let&#39;s help them out!</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t a call to shill, but a call to <del>flex</del> (eh... nevermind) <em>show</em> our muscle as a community. Like GitCoin grants and throwing $5 at Pool together, this is a great way for the non-techies of this sub to make an impact.</p>\n\n<p>Currently the following dapps officially tweeted to #supporteip1559:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1361619247097647106\">AAVE</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/airswap/status/1361660201389199368\">AirSwap</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bZxHQ/status/1361837031161163776\">bZx</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darkforest_eth/status/1361003830876512260\">Dark Forest</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeFiSaver/status/1361401505023148034\">DeFi Saver</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/defidollar/status/1361941110327681025\">Defi Dollar</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dharma_HQ/status/1361169649946161154\">Dharma</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mstable_/status/1361612179959644160\">mStable</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1361368508043509763\">Loopring</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/opyn_/status/1361321827633668096\">Opyn</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paraswap/status/1360950693037760521\">ParaSwap</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YamFinance/status/1361017006363996162\">YAM Finance</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are aware of any dapps that have shown support for EIP-1559 that aren&#39;t list on the site, please let InsideTheSimulation know ( <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/InsideTheSimulation/\">u/InsideTheSimulation</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InsideTheSim\">https://twitter.com/InsideTheSim</a>). Normally I really wouldn&#39;t make a &quot;Wikipedia needs your help&quot; type post, but truly the more dapps we can get showing support the more likely EIP-1559 passes without contention.

It&#39;s simple for end users AND it&#39;s decentralized, so if I&#39;m running a RP node here at my house and I end up running two copies of my keys, I&#39;ll get that low 5% penalty and other users in the RP system won&#39;t be at risk of losing 100% of their funds.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-17 05:42:58","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-02-17 05:52:57","id":"gnrhg83","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_llnhve","parent_id":"t1_gnqp0mh","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/defewit","body":"I mean CB has 25% commission.

(I say all this as a narrative allegory, not that betamax was actually better). Then we will be left with this kind of piece of shit blockchain / VHS until we experience another data format reorg</p>\n\n<p>Also, DOT and cardano have very little in common. Dot is like ETH&#39;s older, bigger, smarter, stronger brother. But yes, DOT looks like a much better investment than Eth right now. I have been watching it for about 6 months now, and i&#39;m getting close to pulling the trigger - even though i have insane tax liabilities. It is weird how you&#39;re calling it a &quot;ghost&quot; chain - seems like you&#39;re not up to date on DOT?</p>\n\n<p>I understand that believing in a magical future is one way for us cope with today&#39;s unpleasant realities, but it may not be the most productive. Rather than hoping against hope that ETH somehow recovers, why not swim with the current of reality and benefit from it?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-17 10:11:54","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-02-17 10:16:24","id":"gnsgqiv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_llnhve","parent_id":"t1_gnsf8ez","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Survivaleast","body":"Bitcoin has certainly proven that incumbency advantage exists, otherwise it would have fallen to superior advancements long ago.
