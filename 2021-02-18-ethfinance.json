Recently their position has evolved to claim [\"I \\[Flexpool\\] am pushing for compromise, basically the Devs can offer miners something that helps make up for the loss.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/lhz8c5/eth_1559_and_20_update_and_timelines/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) Yet their website still displays Flexpool as \"opposing\" / for \"stopping\" EIP-1559, their medium article linked above still claims Flexpool is \"against\" EIP-1559, and [their pinned tweet on twitter](https://twitter.com/flexpool_io?lang=en) states Flexpool's objection \"against EIP-1559\" as well. Flexpool has shown public support for the following EIPs:\n\n* [EIP-3143](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3143-increase-block-rewards-to-5-eth/5061) which would increase the block reward from 2 to 5 - [Statement Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/l1u2pa/support_eip3143_to_compensate_for_reduced_fee/gk1kq29?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* [EIP-969](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-969.md) which would look to remove ASIC dominance - [Statement Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/liszi1/its_time_to_vote_on_what_miners_want_to_be_done/gn57kng/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nFlexpool's [response to my initial post can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2btor?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Their response choose not to address their tone over the last month and when questioned more directly about their continued aggression - Flexpool choose not to answer.

It seems they do not wish to acknowledge that any of their actions have been inflammatory, let alone apologize for it.\n\nAll said, I strongly encourage everyone to read their initial response linked above as I believe it shows just how much doublespeak is going on between their \"in public\" attitude of compromise and their \"mining community\" mindset of anti-dev / anti-community sentiment. Of everything I shared, I find the following quote the most impactful in all this. It really speaks to where their motivations lie and where their priorities are. Of course, when addressed on this quote, they remained silent.\n\n>1559 hurts only one party so it\u2019s fair that another change be made that helps reduce the impact, **especially when that change only benefits ETH.** [\\- Flexpool](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2cjs5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**Remember: Every single mining pool on that site that has not directly denounced Flexpool's actions is functionally support this type of behavior.** **Their silence is signaling approval of these actions.** Which as of today includes: Spark Pool / Etheremine / Nanopool / Hiveon / 2Miners / Ezil / Ethashpool / WoolyPooly / Crazypool\n\nWhile Cruxpool is listed on the site, they have clarified that while they do not support EIP-1559, they also do not support Flexpool's actions and as such I have removed them from the list above.

Flexpool has shown public support for the following EIPs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3143-increase-block-rewards-to-5-eth/5061\">EIP-3143</a> which would increase the block reward from 2 to 5 - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/l1u2pa/support_eip3143_to_compensate_for_reduced_fee/gk1kq29?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Statement Here</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-969.md\">EIP-969</a> which would look to remove ASIC dominance - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/liszi1/its_time_to_vote_on_what_miners_want_to_be_done/gn57kng/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Statement Here</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Flexpool&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2btor?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">response to my initial post can be found here.</a> Their response choose not to address their tone over the last month and when questioned more directly about their continued aggression - Flexpool choose not to answer. A similar exchange happened <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/liulbp/daily_general_discussion_february_13_2021/gn83kya?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">the following day as well.</a> The difference being they started to claim (and continues to do so) that it is <em>Flexpool</em> that is trying to come to a peaceful solution while <em>the community</em> posts to them in anger. It seems they do not wish to acknowledge that any of their actions have been inflammatory, let alone apologize for it.</p>\n\n<p>All said, I strongly encourage everyone to read their initial response linked above as I believe it shows just how much doublespeak is going on between their &quot;in public&quot; attitude of compromise and their &quot;mining community&quot; mindset of anti-dev / anti-community sentiment. Of everything I shared, I find the following quote the most impactful in all this. It really speaks to where their motivations lie and where their priorities are. Of course, when addressed on this quote, they remained silent.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1559 hurts only one party so it\u2019s fair that another change be made that helps reduce the impact, <strong>especially when that change only benefits ETH.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2cjs5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">- Flexpool</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Remember: Every single mining pool on that site that has not directly denounced Flexpool&#39;s actions is functionally support this type of behavior.</strong> <strong>Their silence is signaling approval of these actions.</strong> Which as of today includes: Spark Pool / Etheremine / Nanopool / Hiveon / 2Miners / Ezil / Ethashpool / WoolyPooly / Crazypool</p>\n\n<p>While Cruxpool is listed on the site, they have clarified that while they do not support EIP-1559, they also do not support Flexpool&#39;s actions and as such I have removed them from the list above.

What I mean by that is that if someone invested in ETH and they think it&#39;s their ticket to retirement, fast cars and big houses then they will fucking destroy anyone they see that does not have that same mindset. &quot;My coin will take me to the moon, yours cannot because I&#39;m not invested in it!&quot; kind of mindset.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of dcinvestor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gainzy5/status/1362616543440474114\">https://twitter.com/gainzy5/status/1362616543440474114</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, props to <a href=\"/u/jtnichol\">/u/jtnichol</a>, he is the only solid dude around here, never seen him insult anyone, just good vibes and bbq.
