My tiny brain can't take it:\n\n~ The Berlin upgrade is [now confirmed to be launching on 14 April](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/248). There was earlier talk of March, but this isn't realistic given the aim to deploy through the various testnets prior to launch. I think this is a solid, pragmatic compromise that helps to ensure the release is sound and properly communicated to the community without adding too much undue delay.\n\n~ The next Eth1 upgrade after Berlin, London, is in the novel spot of needing to be worked on whilst Berlin is still being rolled out. It's not usual to be delivering two separate hard forks at the same time, but such is the keen need to get this done asap - [July is the current ambition.](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245) On the next All Core Devs (ACD) call in two weeks time the aim is to select the EIPs that will go into London. It's likely they will select one big EIP (likely EIP-1559) and a handful of smaller ones, including pushing back the difficulty bomb. \n\n~ The big Eth2 items - HF1, the merge and sharding - are all still on track as per previous updates. Attendance on this week's ACD call was bolstered by the Eth2 gang, looking to progress into development on the merge by bringing the Eth1 and Eth2 teams together as of, well, now. A 'Summer 2022' release date was mooted for the merge, but this was poo pooed by Afri as being overly pessimistic. The feeling seems to be that if merge testing goes well late 2021 it could launch much earlier than summer. I've had this in Q1 2022 for a while now and I stand by it. The hard fork that includes the merge is also being seen as an excellent opportunity to clean up the EVM by removing features no longer needed. [Vitalik writeup on this.](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing)\n\n~ Rocketpool was firing this week - not only did they release [part 2 of their pre-launch explainers](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1), but [PR 2149 was finally merged into the Eth2 spec.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/llbysz/eth2_spec_2149_has_been_merged_it_allows_for/) This is a future change that will allow trustless withdrawals from the beacon chain, a feature that is fundamental to Rocketpool's decentralised vision. Their Sigma Prime audit also kicked off.\n\n~ The upcoming EIP-1559 stakeholder call was briefly discussed by the Eth1 team on this week's ACD call.

As recently as 2/14, Flexpool has continued to [direct people to their site](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/lja4ob/are_we_the_baddies/gnet3up?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \\--- **This page undoubtedly represents their current & active opinion on the matter.**\n\nThis language continued in other posts and articles as well: [here](https://medium.com/flexpool/flexpool-announces-its-position-against-eip-1559-heres-why-c5275b7c4465), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/kxf85z/flexpool_officially_announces_its_position/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/l2yeuq/an_update_of_pools_that_have_officially_announced/gk905h3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The 'respectful manner' seems to only be for show - as once Flexpool returns to the miners and pools they represent it is back to inciting anti-dev / anti-community emotions. **Flexpool in no uncertain terms has considered this a war** \\- *\"Upvote this post! Spread it; otherwise, we will lose the war between miners and speculators.\"* [(Source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/kxf85z/flexpool_officially_announces_its_position/)\n\nFlexpool's original position (per their website / medium article linked above) was a complete stopping of EIP-1559. Recently their position has evolved to claim [\"I \\[Flexpool\\] am pushing for compromise, basically the Devs can offer miners something that helps make up for the loss.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/lhz8c5/eth_1559_and_20_update_and_timelines/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) Yet their website still displays Flexpool as \"opposing\" / for \"stopping\" EIP-1559, their medium article linked above still claims Flexpool is \"against\" EIP-1559, and [their pinned tweet on twitter](https://twitter.com/flexpool_io?lang=en) states Flexpool's objection \"against EIP-1559\" as well. Flexpool has shown public support for the following EIPs:\n\n* [EIP-3143](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3143-increase-block-rewards-to-5-eth/5061) which would increase the block reward from 2 to 5 - [Statement Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/l1u2pa/support_eip3143_to_compensate_for_reduced_fee/gk1kq29?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* [EIP-969](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-969.md) which would look to remove ASIC dominance - [Statement Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/liszi1/its_time_to_vote_on_what_miners_want_to_be_done/gn57kng/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nFlexpool's [response to my initial post can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2btor?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Their response choose not to address their tone over the last month and when questioned more directly about their continued aggression - Flexpool choose not to answer. A similar exchange happened [the following day as well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/liulbp/daily_general_discussion_february_13_2021/gn83kya?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) The difference being they started to claim (and continues to do so) that it is *Flexpool* that is trying to come to a peaceful solution while *the community* posts to them in anger. It seems they do not wish to acknowledge that any of their actions have been inflammatory, let alone apologize for it.\n\nAll said, I strongly encourage everyone to read their initial response linked above as I believe it shows just how much doublespeak is going on between their \"in public\" attitude of compromise and their \"mining community\" mindset of anti-dev / anti-community sentiment. Of everything I shared, I find the following quote the most impactful in all this. It really speaks to where their motivations lie and where their priorities are. Of course, when addressed on this quote, they remained silent.\n\n>1559 hurts only one party so it\u2019s fair that another change be made that helps reduce the impact, **especially when that change only benefits ETH.** [- Flexpool](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2cjs5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**Remember: Every single mining pool on that site that has not directly denounced Flexpool's actions is functionally support this type of behavior.** **Their silence is signaling approval of these actions.** Which as of today includes: Spark Pool / Etheremine / Nanopool / Hiveon / 2Miners / Ezil / Ethashpool / WoolyPooly / Crazypool\n\nWhile Cruxpool is listed on the site, they have clarified that while they do not support EIP-1559, they also do not support Flexpool's actions and as such I have removed them from the list above.

As recently as 2/14, Flexpool has continued to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/lja4ob/are_we_the_baddies/gnet3up?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">direct people to their site</a> --- <strong>This page undoubtedly represents their current &amp; active opinion on the matter.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This language continued in other posts and articles as well: <a href=\"https://medium.com/flexpool/flexpool-announces-its-position-against-eip-1559-heres-why-c5275b7c4465\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/kxf85z/flexpool_officially_announces_its_position/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/l2yeuq/an_update_of_pools_that_have_officially_announced/gk905h3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">here</a>. The &#39;respectful manner&#39; seems to only be for show - as once Flexpool returns to the miners and pools they represent it is back to inciting anti-dev / anti-community emotions. <strong>Flexpool in no uncertain terms has considered this a war</strong> - <em>&quot;Upvote this post! Spread it; otherwise, we will lose the war between miners and speculators.&quot;</em> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/kxf85z/flexpool_officially_announces_its_position/\">(Source)</a></p>\n\n<p>Flexpool&#39;s original position (per their website / medium article linked above) was a complete stopping of EIP-1559. Recently their position has evolved to claim <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/lhz8c5/eth_1559_and_20_update_and_timelines/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">&quot;I [Flexpool] am pushing for compromise, basically the Devs can offer miners something that helps make up for the loss.&quot;</a> Yet their website still displays Flexpool as &quot;opposing&quot; / for &quot;stopping&quot; EIP-1559, their medium article linked above still claims Flexpool is &quot;against&quot; EIP-1559, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flexpool_io?lang=en\">their pinned tweet on twitter</a> states Flexpool&#39;s objection &quot;against EIP-1559&quot; as well. Flexpool has shown public support for the following EIPs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3143-increase-block-rewards-to-5-eth/5061\">EIP-3143</a> which would increase the block reward from 2 to 5 - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/l1u2pa/support_eip3143_to_compensate_for_reduced_fee/gk1kq29?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Statement Here</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-969.md\">EIP-969</a> which would look to remove ASIC dominance - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/liszi1/its_time_to_vote_on_what_miners_want_to_be_done/gn57kng/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Statement Here</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Flexpool&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2btor?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">response to my initial post can be found here.</a> Their response choose not to address their tone over the last month and when questioned more directly about their continued aggression - Flexpool choose not to answer. A similar exchange happened <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/liulbp/daily_general_discussion_february_13_2021/gn83kya?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">the following day as well.</a> The difference being they started to claim (and continues to do so) that it is <em>Flexpool</em> that is trying to come to a peaceful solution while <em>the community</em> posts to them in anger. It seems they do not wish to acknowledge that any of their actions have been inflammatory, let alone apologize for it.</p>\n\n<p>All said, I strongly encourage everyone to read their initial response linked above as I believe it shows just how much doublespeak is going on between their &quot;in public&quot; attitude of compromise and their &quot;mining community&quot; mindset of anti-dev / anti-community sentiment. Of everything I shared, I find the following quote the most impactful in all this. It really speaks to where their motivations lie and where their priorities are. Of course, when addressed on this quote, they remained silent.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1559 hurts only one party so it\u2019s fair that another change be made that helps reduce the impact, <strong>especially when that change only benefits ETH.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2cjs5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">- Flexpool</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Remember: Every single mining pool on that site that has not directly denounced Flexpool&#39;s actions is functionally support this type of behavior.</strong> <strong>Their silence is signaling approval of these actions.</strong> Which as of today includes: Spark Pool / Etheremine / Nanopool / Hiveon / 2Miners / Ezil / Ethashpool / WoolyPooly / Crazypool</p>\n\n<p>While Cruxpool is listed on the site, they have clarified that while they do not support EIP-1559, they also do not support Flexpool&#39;s actions and as such I have removed them from the list above.

I will write a post every month. I just want feedback on my thoughts, best case give you guys some food for thought as well and improve my crypto knowledge. I somehow picked the 20th of every month, cause ETH will go to... 10k :) This is post number 2, on the day ETH hit 2k.  \n\nThis time I'll focus on three points, airdrops, business model and DPI as my favorite defi project of the last month. \n\nLets start with airdrops:\n\nAirdrops are a crazy innovation. I have profited a lot, my first airdrop was BOMB (which obviously is somehow different than the airdrops we see these days), which indirectly lead to UNI and I was eligible for about 5 different ones until now. I truly believe we are just at the beginning of airdrops and eventually even \u201cnormal\u201d startups might airdrop shares in the future. One example could be gaming startups that hand out shares to their early community. But I'll focus on crypto for now.    \nWhy are these protocols doing airdrops at all? I think there are several reasons. One is marketing and community building, a second one of course decentralization and governance. I don\u2019t think they wanna incentivize altruistic behavior (by e.g. including gitcoin rounds). I think they pick those users because people that know gitcoin are more likely to be ETH power users than a random guy who made one transaction on UNI. They pick criteria they think will fit their core community best.   \nWhat they of course do is create a kind of FOMO. This leads to usage and people exploring more and more protocols, but also to airdrop farming\u2026 A lot of people including myself try to game airdrops. I can already tell you though that I have stopped chasing airdrops. And there are a lot of reasons for that. I think the UNI airdrop is a beauty because of its fair and equal distribution. At the same time I think we won\u2019t see these kind of airdrops a lot because they are too easy to farm. Interact 10/100 times with different wallets with a new protocol = profit? Those days are over I guess. New airdrops already show us where things are heading. 1INCH raised the bar by adding a min volume. Other airdrops distribute the tokens based on volume. So 1 huge transaction = 100 small ones. I really don\u2019t like the last way of airdropping, because it\u2019s just further benefiting whales, but maybe that\u2019s part of the game. The second 1INCH airdrop for UNI users is also interesting because it targets a smaller segment of UNI traders. Another great new airdrop seems to be the UMA airdrop. Not because of who they target, but because of the airdrop itself. Only if you hold it and certain goals are reached, you can expect the max value. All these minor evolutions show us whats possible. On top there are of course fees that make me think twice if these gambles are worth it. I'll try new protocols regularly, but to learn, not to make money.   \nI think future airdrops will carefully target their audience. Protocols will exclude low/ failed transactions, add loyalty, drop it to user that are likely to use their product. That means that you and I will not receive a lot of airdrops that are irrelevant. So don\u2019t chase airdrops. Be happy whenever you get one. Don\u2019t be mad when you didn\u2019t. It is too hard to predict requirements and you'll probably spend more on fees than anything else. \n\nBusiness Model in crypto:\n\nThe business model was always a bit blurry to me. Especially with the \"eliminate the middle man\" narrative that really confused me for some time. How can you/ devs/ a company make money? And which ways of generating revenues are even considered okay be the community? The first business model in crypto was \u201cnumber go up\u201d. Mine/ pre-mine a coin or token and sell it to fund your business. Cool. But what happens once you run out of coins to sell? Donations? That\u2019s not a reliable business model. In my opinion even ETH was missing one for a long time. Newly minted ETH didn\u2019t go to developers, but to miners to make sure the chain was secure. So the fees = \"revenue\" didn't go to the organization improving the blockchain... Strange isn't it if you think about it? PoS / Staking changes that, because ETH generates revenues via staking that the developers can use to finance their development without running out of funds in the future.   \nBut obviously there are more viable business models. Some of those are probably misunderstood and I also needed some time to connect the dots. \u201cEliminate the middle man\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that a protocol that offers a viable product/ service shouldn\u2019t take fees. \"Eliminate the middle man\" doesn't mean eliminate companies or organizations. It refers to the hope/ wish/ or pushes for (more) decentralized organizations. But obviously those still are organizations or companies (even if not in the legal sense). Most of them are even backed by VCs. And no VC will invest money if there was no business. So what's the deal then? One example: Binance (centralized, off chain) vs. UNI (rather decentralized, on chain). Binance is probably seen as a \"middle man\" while UNI is not. Equal to ETH UNI doesn't receive any of the fees generated (as of now). In other words: UNI shouldn\u2019t forward 100% of the fees to liquidity providers, but take a share to fund development. This will most likely happen indirectly via fee distribution to UNI holders and IMO obviously makes sense. Actually all people using the protocol and obviously also other stake holders like liquidity providers etc. should be happy to pay a fee because that fee allows the continuous development of the product they use, support decentralization and longterm development (SaaS if you wanna call it like that). It\u2019s not evil to ask for a fee for a great service. And being the (automated, neutral, permitionless, code-based) middle man between two parties that want to swap tokens needs to be rewarded. Another business model we see right now is not even having a token, but taking a fee for your service, like e.g. Metamask does it with their swap feature. In that case there are 2 (or even 3 fees, transaction fee, LP fee, MM fee), and one goes directly to Metamask. I guess for most this is kind of the middle ground, and even great if there is a token at one point. \n\nSummary: Protocols need a viable business model = revenue to exist longterm, cause always selling tokens will end eventually. The more decentralized this happens, the more people will be okay with it. \n\nBut I am really looking forward to your thoughts on this, additions, views etc. \n\nFavorit DeFi project of the month: DPI  \nAs I said I'll try to check out one project per month. This month it's DPI. Its an index of the top 10 defi coins out there. That of course means you wont really learn a lot (because its \"buy and keep in your wallet\"), but still I wanted to share my thoughts. DPI has one big advantage: you might know that defi is \u201chuge\u201d. You might assume that defi is this bull runs ICO (I do). Thus you expect defi to blow up (I do). But you still have no idea which projects are really worth it (I have no real idea). DPI might be the solution to get defi exposure without investing too much time and without too much risk. The protocols included are kind of the \u201cblue chips\u201d in defi. Obviously that also means that they have grown a lot (in terms of $$$) and there might be less room to grow. But: if you don\u2019t wanna risk too much, still try to participate in the defi story and learn a bit about some the coins DPI might be the thing you want or need. I did buy some and they have already doubled\u2026 Since a lot of people are asking questions around defi and which tokens to buy, I thought this might help some of you to know where to start. There are already similar solutions and afaik there will be more. Please don't consider this a \"buy my bags\". Obviously indirectly it is, but that's not my intention. \n\nI could have written about so many other things (EIP-1559, so interesting topic; crypto twitter, NFTs...) but i wanted to focus on a few topics rather than having 10 bullets, with only high level thoughts. \n\nReally looking forward to some feedback!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To clarify my own thoughts (and later on act based on that...)

But as explanations seem scarce, people only say &quot;just replace username with your username and it works&quot; and after 10.mins it&#39;s still not showing that it&#39;s working, I assume I did something wrong.</p>\n\n<p>So I think I&#39;m mining ETH now,on a pool that supports eip 1559. </p>\n\n<p>For anyone also wanting to set up: it took about 20 mins for my hashrate to show up in f2pool.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-20 03:47:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"go418xf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lo0oby","parent_id":"t1_go3xyki","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SwagtimusPrime","body":"Yes, I got confused as well when I set it up because it also didn't show up for me after 10mins.\n\nGlad it worked out for you, cheers","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes, I got confused as well when I set it up because it also didn&#39;t show up for me after 10mins.</p>\n\n<p>Glad it worked out for you, cheers</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-20 04:30:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"go443aw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lo0oby","parent_id":"t1_go418xf","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Invisible_Symbol","body":"> But they don't explain if I should also give the worker a name and if so, where.\n\nworker names are only really usefully if you have multiple miners, so you can differentiate between them.

However, I don't think that that is what will happen in reality. Let me explain:\n\nThe reason Gas fees seem to peak between 100-200 Gwei is because people don't want to pay more than $X for a transaction/contract interaction. This leaves many people on the sideline waiting to send transactions as soon as gas prices drop to Y Gwei. EIP-1559 doesn't increase transaction throughput, it just makes the bidding system more efficient and miners get smaller tips while more ETH gets burned. So now that gas prices are more efficient, what happens? All of the people waiting on the sidelines start using the network again until gas prices hit 100-200 Gwei again and then they stop transacting. It's the same reason why building more highway lanes doesn't reduce congestion. The new lanes attract the people who have been waiting on the sidelines for a less congested highway to fill in the new capacity until it appears that no improvements to congestion have been made.\n\nI think the same will happen for much of the on-chain L2 solutions like roll-ups. Sure, soon we will be able to use Uniswap much cheaper and it will move 20% of transactions off the main chain, but that 20% will soon be replaced by 20% of people on the sideline who were waiting for 90 Gwei gas fees to use their favourite DeFi farm or mint some NFTs. In the end, gas fees will barely be any cheaper (definitely less than 20% cheaper) and the only day to day improvement was for users of Uniswap, not Ethereum users in general (excluding of course the improved UX which comes from a cheap Uniswap bringing more users to Ethereum).\n\nThe only real solution for gas prices across the whole ecosystem is ETH 2.0. In my opinion, 64x capacity will be enough to let everyone execute their transaction for a few cents or a dollar for contract interactions. Then from there, we will move more DApps onto L2 so only more important transactions use the base layer.\n\nAnyway, I'm not saying anyone is right or wrong here, I just want to see what others think of my theory. Let's have a constructive discussion about who is right here. ***Also, I'm definitely not bashing EIP-1559. It's a great UX improvement and even better it is good for ETH tokenomics and removes the threat of miner created block re-organisation attacks when gas fees are greater than the block reward.***\n\n**TL;DR:** Gas prices are a construct of supply of blockspace and demand of how many people are willing to pay for that blockspace and how much they'll pay. EIP-1559 doesn't change anything about supply and demand so person X is still willing to pay 200 Gwei for their transaction and person Y is still only going to send the transaction for 100 Gwei or less.\n\nHere's a good explainer on why building new highway lanes doesn't reduce congestion: www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z7o3sRxA5g\n\n**Edit: Really? Downvotes? I'm not even being bearish. I'm sorry I wanted a real discussion and not just another moonboi post. Don't let this sub turn into another r/CryptoCurrency where only comments which fit the narrative are liked and no constructive discussion is had.**\n\nEdit 2: Actually, I just remembered, EIP-1559 has some sort of dynamic block size adjustment based on demand.

I\u2019d like to create a website where you can deposit two of the same erc1155s and get a holographic version of that same card. Thinking burn two and sender gets one back. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone know of where I can get in touch with someone or maybe I can do it with furucombo?
