Of everything I shared, I find the following quote the most impactful in all this. It really speaks to where their motivations lie and where their priorities are. Of course, when addressed on this quote, they remained silent.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1559 hurts only one party so it\u2019s fair that another change be made that helps reduce the impact, <strong>especially when that change only benefits ETH.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2cjs5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">- Flexpool</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Remember: Every single mining pool on that site that has not directly denounced Flexpool&#39;s actions is functionally support this type of behavior.</strong> <strong>Their silence is signaling approval of these actions.</strong> Which as of today includes: Spark Pool / Etheremine / Nanopool / Hiveon / 2Miners / Ezil / Ethashpool / WoolyPooly / Crazypool</p>\n\n<p>While Cruxpool is listed on the site, they have clarified that while they do not support EIP-1559, they also do not support Flexpool&#39;s actions and as such I have removed them from the list above.

My goal is to deposit some Uni and DPI into loopring, from there use loopring to swap Uni to eth to have equal amounts DPI and ETH to then pool them.  It is my understanding that I will receive INDEX as well as my share of fees for being a liquidity provider.  Is this correct, is there anything else I have to do.  I also am worried about impermanent loss.  Kind of cant wrap my head around how to figure out if being a LP is cost effective.  For instance, if ETH greatly outperforms DPI, I assume I would get less DPI than what I deposited into the pool, but the INDEX I receive and having more ETH would be worth it.  Is this correct?</p>\n\n<p>I played around with Curve to become a stETH LP, however I must have selected to not stake in gauge when I deposited into the pool, now to do that would cost ~$100 in gas and doesn&#39;t seem to be worth it, as I just wanted to see how the mechanics of all this stuff works.  This is becoming hard to play with with gas prices so high.  If anyone has any resources to link to or can break down anything I am missing, I would be all ears and very appreciative.  Ultimately would like to be getting the CRV and LDO from being a stETH/ETH LP on curve.  Curve has a CALC feature and I cant seem to understand that.  When I used the calc on Curve, it says with just .8 stETH deposited I could get over 2k CRV in a year.  That seems absurd and way off.  Again, would love to just play around with this stuff my self to get a better understanding, but thats not really an option with gas prices.  Thanks in advance for any insight anyone can provide.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-21 11:31:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"go9a38y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_loqfr4","parent_id":"t3_loqfr4","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethacct","body":"The easiest way to think about impermanent loss (or better called 'divergent loss') is with ETH and stablecoins, instead of ETH and another volatile token.\n\nImagine that ETH is $1000.

Debt is automatically paid down as the yield is earned through Yearn\n\n* alUSD can be unwrapped to get DAI + yield in the form of stable coins\n\n* alUSD can be used to pay down an outstanding debt position, and when used in this context, is always seen at the value of Dai from within the system\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo overall a lot is going on here and my head is kind of spinning. It almost sounds like a way to print money using DeFi. Some things that confuse me are:\n\n* There doesn't ever seem to be a good reason to pay down your debt unless you really need back that collateral. Paying back your debt using alUSD seems like it would be a waste since the system sees alUSD in this context as having the same value as Dai, yet alUSD can be unwrapped for better value\n\n* How is the liquidity for the unwrapping (transmutation) provided to the protocol? I'm guessing it would have to be from the collateral unless it's using something like Cream's iron bank.\n\n* How do fluctuations to Dai effect the value of alUSD? alUSD is touted as being governance-minimized, but since yield and collateral are both based on Dai it'll still depend largely on MKR governance. It says other stable coins will come later so maybe this is only a temporary concern, but maybe worth noting and discussing for the project's first iteration.\n\n* How can one determine a fair valuation for alUSD? It seems like this will largely depend on the current yield of Dai within Yearn and open the door for plenty of arbitrage opportunities, both in this sense, and in the sense that paying down debt always sees alUSD as equivalent to Dai.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMaybe it's too early to be asking these questions, and to be honest I probably should have reread the article a few more times before posting, but I'm hoping someone here will be able to weigh in and make sense of it more quickly to help fill in the gaps.
