If you're newer, you've never lived through it.  If you're a grizzled vet who has been hodling long enough, you might have watched a year or two of your salary evaporate.\n* I was a buyer today.  You may not have been, but I just hope y'all didn't panic sell.\n* My tendency is to be pretty optimistic.  I'm hoping we don't have any kind of double dip back to $1500, but it's certainly possible to go that deep....or deeper.  I 'member summer of 2017 going from an ATH around $420 down to around $130.  And we bled for quite some time.  \n* You can whine about the ratio, but Big Daddy is probably keeping us from a deeper dip or a more time-consuming recovery.  \n* One concern I have is that the NASDAQ 100 was also hit hard today.  That leads me to believe it might be more than a few days to a new ATH.  \n* Thinking back to January of 2018, we had several days in a row of absolutely violent, high-volume dumping like what we had ten hours ago.  It was UNRELENTING.  IF we got that out of our system for a while, that's a good thing.  We might not run back up to the ATH in a week, but that just lets you accumulate more.\n* I DO see some reasons why we might not have the same quick recovery as the earlier 2021 dips.  I do NOT see many reasons why we would be at or near the end of a cycle.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Posted the numbers earlier, but I have been AFK from then until right now.

You may not have been, but I just hope y&#39;all didn&#39;t panic sell.</li>\n<li>My tendency is to be pretty optimistic.  I&#39;m hoping we don&#39;t have any kind of double dip back to $1500, but it&#39;s certainly possible to go that deep....or deeper.  I &#39;member summer of 2017 going from an ATH around $420 down to around $130.  And we bled for quite some time.<br/></li>\n<li>You can whine about the ratio, but Big Daddy is probably keeping us from a deeper dip or a more time-consuming recovery.<br/></li>\n<li>One concern I have is that the NASDAQ 100 was also hit hard today.  That leads me to believe it might be more than a few days to a new ATH.<br/></li>\n<li>Thinking back to January of 2018, we had several days in a row of absolutely violent, high-volume dumping like what we had ten hours ago.  It was UNRELENTING.  IF we got that out of our system for a while, that&#39;s a good thing.  We might not run back up to the ATH in a week, but that just lets you accumulate more.</li>\n<li>I DO see some reasons why we might not have the same quick recovery as the earlier 2021 dips.

I actually do believe in ethereum, but definitely feel like the spikes lately are mostly bitcoin speculation from newbie investors and not actual belief or understanding of the system, and certainly not an understanding of the use cases of ethereum, which are many. I think too much speculative growth can be terrible for long-term adoption because it&#39;ll shake people&#39;s faith in crypto before they even understand what it is.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-22 07:48:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"goclzst","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lpgkry","parent_id":"t3_lpgkry","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"Weekly ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract Data - February 22nd, 2021\n\n* Current ETH Deposited: 3,207,810\n* ETH deposited over last **7 days**: 113,568\n* Current Active Validator Count: 95,833\n* Current APR: 8.70%\n* Validators Waiting to Be Activated - 3,715 (down 3,094 in the last 7 days)\n* Current Validator Wait Time - 4.13 Days\n* Total Unique Validators - 6,663 (+149 in the last 7 days)\n* Number of Validators Slashed - 133 (0 in the last  days)\n* Total USD Value Deposited: $5,719,300,683.30\n* Current Value of Shitcoins Offered to the Deposit Contract Gods (CVSODCG): $1,419,942.74\n\nBelieve it or not the exact same amount entered this week as last week (113,568 ETH)\n\n[Etherscan Address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa) / [Beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/) / [Misc.

It sounds the same as everyone forking Ethereum until you need to establish trust with another party and make a new chain to transact with them.  And isn&#39;t that just a physical machine version of Optimistic Rollups on mainnet?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-22 15:59:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"goegd1q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lpgkry","parent_id":"t1_goef3e2","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/lateralspin","body":"Fantom = Yet Another ICO launched on Ethereum...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Fantom = Yet Another ICO launched on Ethereum...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-22 16:15:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"goeiam6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lpgkry","parent_id":"t1_goegd1q","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"What use is there for ethereum if they can achieve all this in layer 1?

I don't think this is unlike other major crashes/flash crashes we've seen, even in bull markets. Ethereum went from ~10 to ~1440 in a year, and had plenty of \"seems like it's over\" crashes in that timespan.\n\n2. The ratio... I really don't think the ratio matters. Or at least I don't care about it. I mean, the better the ratio, the better ETH has done, but it's not like the ratio is rock solid and holds during rises or falls, and I'm not planning to cash out to Bitcoin, so it is what it is. Related to this, we're in a bull cycle, and there's institutional interest in Bitcoin, so there's no surprise that it's outperforming ETH right now. I'm just happy to see both going up (prior to today that is).\n\n3. The conflict between miners at 1559 was inevitable. As ETH transitions to ETH 2.0 and full PoS, miners are going to get cut out. They've known this for a long time, and if issuance is reduced in the final days, is it REALLY that big of a deal? If they want, let them hard fork the chain. People aren't going to stick around for their benefit.\n\n4. Elon's an idiot.

Ethereum went from ~10 to ~1440 in a year, and had plenty of &quot;seems like it&#39;s over&quot; crashes in that timespan.</p></li>\n<li><p>The ratio... I really don&#39;t think the ratio matters. Or at least I don&#39;t care about it. I mean, the better the ratio, the better ETH has done, but it&#39;s not like the ratio is rock solid and holds during rises or falls, and I&#39;m not planning to cash out to Bitcoin, so it is what it is. Related to this, we&#39;re in a bull cycle, and there&#39;s institutional interest in Bitcoin, so there&#39;s no surprise that it&#39;s outperforming ETH right now. I&#39;m just happy to see both going up (prior to today that is).</p></li>\n<li><p>The conflict between miners at 1559 was inevitable.
