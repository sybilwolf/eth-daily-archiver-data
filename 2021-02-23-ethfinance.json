It seems they do not wish to acknowledge that any of their actions have been inflammatory, let alone apologize for it.</p>\n\n<p>All said, I strongly encourage everyone to read their initial response linked above as I believe it shows just how much doublespeak is going on between their &quot;in public&quot; attitude of compromise and their &quot;mining community&quot; mindset of anti-dev / anti-community sentiment. Of everything I shared, I find the following quote the most impactful in all this. It really speaks to where their motivations lie and where their priorities are. Of course, when addressed on this quote, they remained silent.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1559 hurts only one party so it\u2019s fair that another change be made that helps reduce the impact, <strong>especially when that change only benefits ETH.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2cjs5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">- Flexpool</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Remember: Every single mining pool on that site that has not directly denounced Flexpool&#39;s actions is functionally support this type of behavior.</strong> <strong>Their silence is signaling approval of these actions.</strong> Which as of today includes: Spark Pool / Etheremine / Nanopool / Hiveon / 2Miners / Ezil / Ethashpool / WoolyPooly / Crazypool</p>\n\n<p>While Cruxpool is listed on the site, they have clarified that while they do not support EIP-1559, they also do not support Flexpool&#39;s actions and as such I have removed them from the list above.

Paying BASEFEE should always get in in a timely manner, and since there's an opcode to query it, smart contracts can predict this value.\n\nMiners have some really perverse incentives right now -- they pay all fees back to themselves, so can drive gas higher by adding their own txns with high fees, and then also take bribes to include 0-gas transactions (see below!).   This also fixes that, since all txns have to pay BASEFEE.\n\nAnd that's kinda why the burn -- there's a cost to having a computer have to process a txn, so not taking the BASEFEE at all leaves network open to DDOS attacks.  Can't give it to miners, due to perverse incentives above.
