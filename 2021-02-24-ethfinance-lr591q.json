Spread it; otherwise, we will lose the war between miners and speculators.\"* [(Source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/kxf85z/flexpool_officially_announces_its_position/)\n\nFlexpool's original position (per their website / medium article linked above) was a complete stopping of EIP-1559. Recently their position has evolved to claim [\"I \\[Flexpool\\] am pushing for compromise, basically the Devs can offer miners something that helps make up for the loss.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/lhz8c5/eth_1559_and_20_update_and_timelines/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) Yet their website still displays Flexpool as \"opposing\" / for \"stopping\" EIP-1559, their medium article linked above still claims Flexpool is \"against\" EIP-1559, and [their pinned tweet on twitter](https://twitter.com/flexpool_io?lang=en) states Flexpool's objection \"against EIP-1559\" as well. Flexpool has shown public support for the following EIPs:\n\n* [EIP-3143](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3143-increase-block-rewards-to-5-eth/5061) which would increase the block reward from 2 to 5 - [Statement Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/l1u2pa/support_eip3143_to_compensate_for_reduced_fee/gk1kq29?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* [EIP-969](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-969.md) which would look to remove ASIC dominance - [Statement Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/liszi1/its_time_to_vote_on_what_miners_want_to_be_done/gn57kng/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nFlexpool's [response to my initial post can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2btor?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Their response choose not to address their tone over the last month and when questioned more directly about their continued aggression - Flexpool choose not to answer.

It seems they do not wish to acknowledge that any of their actions have been inflammatory, let alone apologize for it.\n\nAll said, I strongly encourage everyone to read their initial response linked above as I believe it shows just how much doublespeak is going on between their \"in public\" attitude of compromise and their \"mining community\" mindset of anti-dev / anti-community sentiment. Of everything I shared, I find the following quote the most impactful in all this. It really speaks to where their motivations lie and where their priorities are. Of course, when addressed on this quote, they remained silent.\n\n>1559 hurts only one party so it\u2019s fair that another change be made that helps reduce the impact, **especially when that change only benefits ETH.** [- Flexpool](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2cjs5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**Remember: Every single mining pool on that site that has not directly denounced Flexpool's actions is functionally support this type of behavior.** **Their silence is signaling approval of these actions.** Which as of today includes: Spark Pool / Etheremine / Nanopool / Hiveon / 2Miners / Ezil / Ethashpool / WoolyPooly / Crazypool\n\nWhile Cruxpool is listed on the site, they have clarified that while they do not support EIP-1559, they also do not support Flexpool's actions and as such I have removed them from the list above.

Flexpool has shown public support for the following EIPs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3143-increase-block-rewards-to-5-eth/5061\">EIP-3143</a> which would increase the block reward from 2 to 5 - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/l1u2pa/support_eip3143_to_compensate_for_reduced_fee/gk1kq29?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Statement Here</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-969.md\">EIP-969</a> which would look to remove ASIC dominance - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/liszi1/its_time_to_vote_on_what_miners_want_to_be_done/gn57kng/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Statement Here</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Flexpool&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2btor?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">response to my initial post can be found here.</a> Their response choose not to address their tone over the last month and when questioned more directly about their continued aggression - Flexpool choose not to answer. A similar exchange happened <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/liulbp/daily_general_discussion_february_13_2021/gn83kya?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">the following day as well.</a> The difference being they started to claim (and continues to do so) that it is <em>Flexpool</em> that is trying to come to a peaceful solution while <em>the community</em> posts to them in anger. It seems they do not wish to acknowledge that any of their actions have been inflammatory, let alone apologize for it.</p>\n\n<p>All said, I strongly encourage everyone to read their initial response linked above as I believe it shows just how much doublespeak is going on between their &quot;in public&quot; attitude of compromise and their &quot;mining community&quot; mindset of anti-dev / anti-community sentiment. Of everything I shared, I find the following quote the most impactful in all this. It really speaks to where their motivations lie and where their priorities are. Of course, when addressed on this quote, they remained silent.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1559 hurts only one party so it\u2019s fair that another change be made that helps reduce the impact, <strong>especially when that change only benefits ETH.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn2cjs5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">- Flexpool</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Remember: Every single mining pool on that site that has not directly denounced Flexpool&#39;s actions is functionally support this type of behavior.</strong> <strong>Their silence is signaling approval of these actions.</strong> Which as of today includes: Spark Pool / Etheremine / Nanopool / Hiveon / 2Miners / Ezil / Ethashpool / WoolyPooly / Crazypool</p>\n\n<p>While Cruxpool is listed on the site, they have clarified that while they do not support EIP-1559, they also do not support Flexpool&#39;s actions and as such I have removed them from the list above.

Immediately markets can only receive a fifth of the newly produced Ether they were capable of receiving in the mining regime. This is a significant shock in itself to markets, but consider also the billions of dollars worth of Ether that miners must sell each year to cover the massive expense of mining hardware and power. I here hypothesize that: *when POW mining on Ethereum is switched off stakers can (and probably will) corner the Ether market.* \n\nThis is because the cost of production for anyone running more than a couple validators (after the opportunity cost of the value of the ETH staked) is very close to zero. If stakers take out enough during the bull market they they might not even need to sell much ETH during the bear, even for the tax bill the staking income generates. In fact, during the bear is when they will be trying to top up their validator counts with cheap ETH. The bottom line is any staker who wants to grow their staking return is going to need to reinvest much of their earnings in new validators, rather than sell earnings for hardware, power and profits. For ETH stakers, profits are literally measured (in part) in ETH, and in new validators earned. Hence, the change from mining to staking fundamentally changes the market dynamic of new supply and demand. This is because stakers will be able to significantly limit the flow of ETH to markets at essentially zero cost. The holders/stakers will take control of the cost of ETH, linking the incentives to run the network with those who benefit from the capital appreciation of the tokens, now responsible for the security and non-gamability of the permissionless platform. \n\nIn the mining system you ask of any miner: \"can you do it profitably?\", and \"how much of your earnings must you sell to cover the cost?\" The answers are in the long run (for more and more miners, a potent centralising force) \"no\" and \"almost all\". In staking the question is completely reversed: \"how can you not do it profitably, given how insignificant the cost is (excluding the required ETH)\", and so \"how little of the earnings are you able to sell?\". Before, every miner is racing every other miner to sell enough ETH at the current market price to not go bankrupt. Now, stakers are competing with each other at the absolute other end of the liquidity pool - they are competing in how much of their ETH earnings they can reinvest back into new validators to compound their growth faster than other validators. \n\nAs an early miner who became discouraged by the disproportionate risks and costs facing smaller miners I have long been excited by the decentralising potential of blockchain validation through staking, but also about its more egalitarian nature (i.e. smaller players don't automatically get squeezed out economically long term) and its green potential (we run 100% solar powered validators). While I used to believe that miners could corner the crypto market and dictate prices, I learned that they can't, given the costs. It's like if you don't defect (i.e. sell) you end up going bankrupt as a miner. As a staker, if you don't reinvest everything and more into staking (i.e. hold), you earn a smaller and smaller share of the total reward - you get squeezed by the long term decline in the staking return. Perhaps, because of this, the severity and course of the Proof of Work bear market cycle will be fundamentally changed starting at the phase 1 launch, as instead of the relentless POW sell pressure from high costs driving the price downwards, the negligible costs of staking mean stakers can cheaply limit some the downside of the bear (e.g. by collectively selling no new issuance below a target price).\n\nStakers, consider this a call to arms.

These people will never \"hodl\" or ride out a bear because at its fundemental level, they have no understanding or belief in the product, they have no reason to believe it's going to come back, so they bail and they bail hard.\n\n\\#2 are all about decentralization.  It's the only thing that matters in crypto.  These people stay far away from centralized options because they know they have no place in this market.  They might dabble here or there to make a quick buck (briefly turning into #1), but never long term.\n\nWhat's the end result?  The only people buying centralized coins are those from #1 (or day-traders from #2 who will bail just like #1 will when the market goes south).  That makes centralized coins pump and dumps.  They have no lasting power, they'll pump hard and then crash even lower, and will most likely never recover.\n\nIf you need an example just look at EOS.  A bunch of people who didn't understand the market bought into it looking to get rich quick, and when the market turned sour they all bailed and never came back.

There are two kinds of people who get into crypto:</p>\n\n<p>1) People looking to get rich quick</p>\n\n<p>2) People who understand the fundamental technology and what it means for the world</p>\n\n<p>#1 don&#39;t care about decentralization, it means nothing to them.  #1 are also not tied to any particular product, they&#39;ll jump on anything that moves and dump it as soon as it turns around.  These people will never &quot;hodl&quot; or ride out a bear because at its fundemental level, they have no understanding or belief in the product, they have no reason to believe it&#39;s going to come back, so they bail and they bail hard.</p>\n\n<p>#2 are all about decentralization.  It&#39;s the only thing that matters in crypto.  These people stay far away from centralized options because they know they have no place in this market.  They might dabble here or there to make a quick buck (briefly turning into #1), but never long term.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the end result?  The only people buying centralized coins are those from #1 (or day-traders from #2 who will bail just like #1 will when the market goes south).  That makes centralized coins pump and dumps.  They have no lasting power, they&#39;ll pump hard and then crash even lower, and will most likely never recover.</p>\n\n<p>If you need an example just look at EOS.  A bunch of people who didn&#39;t understand the market bought into it looking to get rich quick, and when the market turned sour they all bailed and never came back.

Not enough for me) , so it varies. Right now I'm drinking a Brazilian Adrano, which is one of my favorites (has a very unique flavor, as it's grown in a region w/ volcanoes, so the volcanic ash in the soil leads to interesting roast profiles (almost a very butterscotch like flavor, amongst others \\[usually hints of cocao and nut\\] depending on roast profile). Sort of  how San Marzano tomatoes/sauce made from them tastes different), but it's often difficult to source these beans.\n\nWhen it's not this, I usually grab unroasted beans from my old boss since he charges me what he pays (about $3-$4/lb) for top of the line beans he sources himself. My favorite single origins (from favorite to least, but these are all favorites of mine\\] he gets are: Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (by far the best. Most say it has fruity overtones, but IMO this means it was roasted to the wrong profile. You want a medium-dark roast \\[but *always* avoid dark-roast. It's a marketing ploy, and a really smart one, to burn inferior beans so you don't taste the poor flavor profiles. Dark doesn't mean stronger \u2014 this misconception dates back primarily to 1800s france, when the poor found a way to utilize cheaper/not so great beans \\[You can still go pretty dark, you just don't want a *true* dark roast, easiest identified by being totally black and shiny. Once it has that sheen from the oils, it's burnt, but sold as \"dark roast!\"\\])/ Anyway, roasted well, you get a kind of buttery mixed with chocolate profile, which is what I typically aim for. I'll sometimes make blends to add some nutty tones.\n\nThose being my two favorite, I also really enjoy Costa Rican, Monsoon Malabar, Mocha Java, and Kenyan AA. Colombian supremo is decent too, but I usually rely on this more for when I'm making blends (I experiment with all the ones already mentioned, and try others, as well). I think hawaiin Kona \\[or anything\\] is overrated and overpriced, but I get why some like. And Jamaican Blue Mountain is a nice (super expensive) treat when my former boss can source enough of it for the right price.\n\nFor brewing: pour-over has become my favorite, especially now that I've honed my technique. I think the Hario V60 is the best option for pourover, and handily beats out the trendy Chemex (which I still like, but V60 is better, w/ cheaper filtrs). There's also a kind of... automatic (in a way) pourover made by OXO that's actually decent when I'm in a rush. So definitely my #1 preferred method.\n\nNext is French press, but for some reason, the oils that don't get filtered (since it's not a paper filter) amps me up mor than caffeine, to the point of having heart palpitations lol, so I don't do it often. However, I've found doing a french press, and then running th finished brew over a pourover paper filter does the job and tastes great.\n\nAfter than... I guess probably the Mocha Master (a coffee machine, believe it or not, but makes an amazing cup).\n\nAeropress comes in somewhat close.\n\nThen, I often enjoy a Bialetti \\[or moka pot/stovetop percolator\\], but this isn't really ideal/would be frowned upon by coffee snobs (ya, IK I'm one lol), but growing up Italian, and having one of these going every Sunday dinner (at least), I've come to really enjoy it, probably more for nostalgia.\n\nAlso have a *really* cool vacuum pot, but it's a PITA, so even though it makes a good cup, I only use it when company is over and they want a show put on lol.\n\nWell... think that about covers it lol\n\n\\[**edit**\\] Guess I'll add: as much as I was against it, and still don't/\\[likely won't\\] own one, I was pretty impressed with what the Nespresso's can do. It's actually pretty good for what it is! I assumed I'd basically be getting a kind of Keurig attempt at espresso, but that wasn't the case. Idk what I'd classify it as... because it isn't really espresso \\[nor like a cap. or latte\\] or coffee, but it's decent. I will, however, eventually get a legit espresso machine (but probably not until moon-time, because a legit one is thousands of dollars. Even the pretty nice home ones from like, Breville or DeLonghi, aren't true espresso machines. They just require too much calibration perfection, pressure, etc, that the 'made for home' ones can't accomplish, expensive as they are. Probably possible to find a used one right now, with all the restaurants/cafes closing up from lockdowns, though for a decent price)\n\n\\[**Another edit**\\] And just in case anyone is as interested in coffee as I am lol, I'll give a few more tips: So...\n\n\u2022 home roasting is important for a great cup, but not the biggest factor. It makes the perfect cup for 2 main reasons: you know it's fresh, and you can personally experiment to get the exact bean(s) and roast profile you like. However, if you have a local roaster, or anywhere where you can get beans roasted within the past week, that's good enough (generally, whole bean coffee, stored correctly, still goes stale by about 2 weeks, sometimes 3. You can visually see this when you brew \\[by pourover\\] by seeing how much \"bloom\" you get when the water first hits \\[fresh coffee = HUGE bloom. Stale = no bloom. These are the gasses releasing\\].\n\n\u2022 So, what IS most important, is getting fresh coffee, and *keeping* it whole-bean. You think whole-bean goes stale quick? Ground goes stale within the day (many say within 15-30 minutes of being ground.

If you only make a cup a day, it may be fine. Otherwise, it could at least replace your gym membership. Grind size is also incredibly important, as it will determine the brew-time and strength of your coffee more than any other factor. I like a *really* strong cup (and often add some cream and sugar), so I tend to go a bit on the finer size, often reaching over 4/close to a 5 minute brew (albeit for two large travel mugs/2 people's worth).

I love this more than I should)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Always home roast (especially nice now, now that I bought my old bosses industrial roaster [years back worked at a coffee shop/roastery] to replace my small one (only mad like, 1/2 lb at a time. Not enough for me) , so it varies. Right now I&#39;m drinking a Brazilian Adrano, which is one of my favorites (has a very unique flavor, as it&#39;s grown in a region w/ volcanoes, so the volcanic ash in the soil leads to interesting roast profiles (almost a very butterscotch like flavor, amongst others [usually hints of cocao and nut] depending on roast profile). Sort of  how San Marzano tomatoes/sauce made from them tastes different), but it&#39;s often difficult to source these beans.</p>\n\n<p>When it&#39;s not this, I usually grab unroasted beans from my old boss since he charges me what he pays (about $3-$4/lb) for top of the line beans he sources himself. My favorite single origins (from favorite to least, but these are all favorites of mine] he gets are: Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (by far the best. Most say it has fruity overtones, but IMO this means it was roasted to the wrong profile. You want a medium-dark roast [but <em>always</em> avoid dark-roast. It&#39;s a marketing ploy, and a really smart one, to burn inferior beans so you don&#39;t taste the poor flavor profiles. Dark doesn&#39;t mean stronger \u2014 this misconception dates back primarily to 1800s france, when the poor found a way to utilize cheaper/not so great beans [You can still go pretty dark, you just don&#39;t want a <em>true</em> dark roast, easiest identified by being totally black and shiny. Once it has that sheen from the oils, it&#39;s burnt, but sold as &quot;dark roast!&quot;])/ Anyway, roasted well, you get a kind of buttery mixed with chocolate profile, which is what I typically aim for. I&#39;ll sometimes make blends to add some nutty tones.</p>\n\n<p>Those being my two favorite, I also really enjoy Costa Rican, Monsoon Malabar, Mocha Java, and Kenyan AA. Colombian supremo is decent too, but I usually rely on this more for when I&#39;m making blends (I experiment with all the ones already mentioned, and try others, as well). I think hawaiin Kona [or anything] is overrated and overpriced, but I get why some like. And Jamaican Blue Mountain is a nice (super expensive) treat when my former boss can source enough of it for the right price.</p>\n\n<p>For brewing: pour-over has become my favorite, especially now that I&#39;ve honed my technique. I think the Hario V60 is the best option for pourover, and handily beats out the trendy Chemex (which I still like, but V60 is better, w/ cheaper filtrs). There&#39;s also a kind of... automatic (in a way) pourover made by OXO that&#39;s actually decent when I&#39;m in a rush. So definitely my #1 preferred method.</p>\n\n<p>Next is French press, but for some reason, the oils that don&#39;t get filtered (since it&#39;s not a paper filter) amps me up mor than caffeine, to the point of having heart palpitations lol, so I don&#39;t do it often. However, I&#39;ve found doing a french press, and then running th finished brew over a pourover paper filter does the job and tastes great.</p>\n\n<p>After than... I guess probably the Mocha Master (a coffee machine, believe it or not, but makes an amazing cup).</p>\n\n<p>Aeropress comes in somewhat close.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I often enjoy a Bialetti [or moka pot/stovetop percolator], but this isn&#39;t really ideal/would be frowned upon by coffee snobs (ya, IK I&#39;m one lol), but growing up Italian, and having one of these going every Sunday dinner (at least), I&#39;ve come to really enjoy it, probably more for nostalgia.</p>\n\n<p>Also have a <em>really</em> cool vacuum pot, but it&#39;s a PITA, so even though it makes a good cup, I only use it when company is over and they want a show put on lol.</p>\n\n<p>Well... think that about covers it lol</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>edit</strong>] Guess I&#39;ll add: as much as I was against it, and still don&#39;t/[likely won&#39;t] own one, I was pretty impressed with what the Nespresso&#39;s can do. It&#39;s actually pretty good for what it is! I assumed I&#39;d basically be getting a kind of Keurig attempt at espresso, but that wasn&#39;t the case. Idk what I&#39;d classify it as... because it isn&#39;t really espresso [nor like a cap. or latte] or coffee, but it&#39;s decent. I will, however, eventually get a legit espresso machine (but probably not until moon-time, because a legit one is thousands of dollars. Even the pretty nice home ones from like, Breville or DeLonghi, aren&#39;t true espresso machines. They just require too much calibration perfection, pressure, etc, that the &#39;made for home&#39; ones can&#39;t accomplish, expensive as they are. Probably possible to find a used one right now, with all the restaurants/cafes closing up from lockdowns, though for a decent price)</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Another edit</strong>] And just in case anyone is as interested in coffee as I am lol, I&#39;ll give a few more tips: So...</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 home roasting is important for a great cup, but not the biggest factor. It makes the perfect cup for 2 main reasons: you know it&#39;s fresh, and you can personally experiment to get the exact bean(s) and roast profile you like. However, if you have a local roaster, or anywhere where you can get beans roasted within the past week, that&#39;s good enough (generally, whole bean coffee, stored correctly, still goes stale by about 2 weeks, sometimes 3. You can visually see this when you brew [by pourover] by seeing how much &quot;bloom&quot; you get when the water first hits [fresh coffee = HUGE bloom. Stale = no bloom. These are the gasses releasing].</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 So, what IS most important, is getting fresh coffee, and <em>keeping</em> it whole-bean. You think whole-bean goes stale quick? Ground goes stale within the day (many say within 15-30 minutes of being ground. You ideally want to grind <em>immediately</em> before brewing)</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Which brings me to my last point: You need a good grinder. Not a cheap $20 blade grinder, but a nice burr coffee grinder (for consistent, and adjustable grounds). The Baratza encore is a fantastic entry level one (and easy to fix if/when it breaks, as it&#39;s all compartmentalized, and replacement parts ar sold cheap online. I believe this is about $130. Won&#39;t find a good one much cheaper, <em>however</em> you can buy a good <em>manual</em> burr grinder for about $20.

Say you have a banking network in your country that has 10,000 in it. Next day Joe and Mary each deposits 10k extra in it. Now your banking system is 30,000. Does that mean your banking system is \"overvalued\"? Does it make sense for onlookers to say your banking system is \"overvalued\" because there are more people willing to participate in it? No! (Unless you dabble in modern frauds known as Fractional Reserve Banking, then no, not really).\n2. The argument that BTC is a 'ponzi' scheme where the \"latecomers\" are paying money for the \"old timers\" to cashout can be made against the banking system, with the fractional reserve lending scheme. Of course BTC can go to 0 if EVERYONE decides to market sell at once. And OF COURSE the whole fucking banking system would collapse if EVERYONE decides to withdraw their money AT ONCE. So this argument is nonsensical.\n3. Again, the same lens can apply to the Ethereum network, when arguing whether or not ETH is overvalued, but instead of a banking network, we can use a different comparison. I haven't been able to come up with anything simple, because ETH is much more complicated than BTC.
