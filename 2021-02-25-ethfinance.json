I was diagnosed with CFS and have had the same issues for years, though maybe not quite as severe as yours. CFS is associated with IBD and these conditions are becoming more prevalent but not understood well at all. After much research and experimentation I managed to substantially improve my situation. If you haven&#39;t yet, I highly recommend that you research elimination diets, low FODMAP, probiotics and the gut microbiome. The past few years has seen a revolution in the science around the microbiome, particularly with the advancements in affordable genomics technologies. With the severity of your condition you could qualify to participate in studies such as those testing FMT which has shown promising results with numerous autoimmune diseases. Most recently there was a case study where FMT sucessfully treated <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869316/\">rheumatoid arthritis</a>! Check out <a href=\"/r/humanmicrobiome\">/r/humanmicrobiome</a></p>\n\n<p>Best of luck to you, bud. Who knows maybe one day your gut health will be in a better spot and ETH will too. You will finally be able to give your bosses desk a gift you can be proud of.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-25 18:13:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gos7ptl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lrzn8b","parent_id":"t1_gos17xr","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/ethfinance","body":"My goodness.

My wife and I have been planning to move out of our small one bedroom apartment for a long time and 2021 was supposed to be our year. Especially now that we suddenly have a baby. This bullrun could not have come at a better time.\n\nCan't believe i actually had the privilege of buying eth at 14 dollars. I remember it fucken doubled to 28 dollars and soon after crashed hard to 15 dollars. I was in a meeting at work and could not think of anything else thinking my chance was gone.Later i resolved to not sell and rather go down with the ship if that's what happened. But, i believed in Ethereum's potential. My father was buying onecoin at this point knowing my involvement in crypto. I indeed told him in no uncertain terms that it was as scam. How can a parent trust some 60 year old nurse coming into your home talking about the wonders of onecoin and how much you can earn if you just recruit enough people and not your son who's actually a nerd, works in IT and maybe knows a thing or two about this.I tipped a friend about eth at 60 dollars, but he wouldn't buy it because it had already increased so much and would rather wait for it to drop. Funny guy.\n\nIn 2017/2018 i was eyeing some beautiful houses that a guy like me shouldn't be able to afford. Was constantly calculating how much money i would have at certain prices and dreaming about owning one of those houses debt free, living like a boss. Of course, somehow the price i was think i'd sell at was constantly moving upwards and i was suddenly also looking at cabins in the woods. What greed !The price started to decline and i was thinking that i could buy the empty loft over my apartment and renovate it. I didn't cash out, just thoughts. And then suddenly my stack was worth just a fraction of what it was at the top and I couldn't buy shit any more.\n\nI've had a gnawing feeling of regret since the last bullrun only tempered by the fact that i haven't acutally lost any money. It's all profit after all.\n\nMy stack was worth less now than last bullrun. Some expensive camping gear (eth wise), CDP's and alts made sure of that. But, I still could not be happier right now !! Even if eth goes to 10k i'll actually have improved our life significantly and i'll always know i was there at the beginning.\n\nProbably a lot of you recognize yourself in this story.\n\nIt's been a privilege hodling with you fine gentlemens !","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Feels good to have finally sold a large portion of my stack. My wife and I have been planning to move out of our small one bedroom apartment for a long time and 2021 was supposed to be our year. Especially now that we suddenly have a baby. This bullrun could not have come at a better time.</p>\n\n<p>Can&#39;t believe i actually had the privilege of buying eth at 14 dollars. I remember it fucken doubled to 28 dollars and soon after crashed hard to 15 dollars. I was in a meeting at work and could not think of anything else thinking my chance was gone.Later i resolved to not sell and rather go down with the ship if that&#39;s what happened. But, i believed in Ethereum&#39;s potential. My father was buying onecoin at this point knowing my involvement in crypto. I indeed told him in no uncertain terms that it was as scam. How can a parent trust some 60 year old nurse coming into your home talking about the wonders of onecoin and how much you can earn if you just recruit enough people and not your son who&#39;s actually a nerd, works in IT and maybe knows a thing or two about this.I tipped a friend about eth at 60 dollars, but he wouldn&#39;t buy it because it had already increased so much and would rather wait for it to drop. Funny guy.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017/2018 i was eyeing some beautiful houses that a guy like me shouldn&#39;t be able to afford. Was constantly calculating how much money i would have at certain prices and dreaming about owning one of those houses debt free, living like a boss. Of course, somehow the price i was think i&#39;d sell at was constantly moving upwards and i was suddenly also looking at cabins in the woods. What greed !The price started to decline and i was thinking that i could buy the empty loft over my apartment and renovate it. I didn&#39;t cash out, just thoughts. And then suddenly my stack was worth just a fraction of what it was at the top and I couldn&#39;t buy shit any more.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve had a gnawing feeling of regret since the last bullrun only tempered by the fact that i haven&#39;t acutally lost any money. It&#39;s all profit after all.</p>\n\n<p>My stack was worth less now than last bullrun. Some expensive camping gear (eth wise), CDP&#39;s and alts made sure of that.

It includes the idea of &quot;batched transactions&quot; -- basically allow submitting multiple txns as a single &quot;all or nothing&quot; atomic unit.  Dapps could then bundle up everything they needed in one call, let you pay a single time for gas.  </p>\n\n<p>(Though this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1301901424381448192\">tweet thread</a> shows the devs have some implementation concerns with the feature)</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Even wilder would be <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2803\">EIP-2803</a> which would allow txns to include raw bytecode. Meaning dapps could have even more power to compose txns with as many separate calls and logic as they wanted; so sites like defisaver &amp; instadapp wouldn&#39;t need their &quot;smart wallet&quot; proxies.  Though I think that approach would increase state size, so &quot;batched txns&quot; might still be preferrable.
