We might also be waiting a couple of months for the next ATH if it follows similar trajectory.  \n* Also possible that $1315 marks the bottom of the dip, but frankly, the volume is unconvincing.\n* I hodled every gwei from $1420 to $80 and back up.

But when \u201cthe merge\u201d happens (when eth1 merged with eth2), issuance will be less because miners won\u2019t be needed any longer, and we will instead have stakers validating the network. Under this validation mechanism, issuance depends on the number of stakers, and it\u2019s approximately going to be 0.5%.

This EIP has a side effect of burning transaction fees, which can further increase the rarity of ETH, and actually make it deflationary (where the total amount of ETH in circulation is actually *negative*, so less than even 0.5%).

I wanted to write this up while it\u2019s still fresh in my mind.  \nFirst a bit of back story, I\u2019ll have been married to my wife, 10 years this March. Her family from Tennessee are a great example of what I see of the typical American Consciousness. Aging parents, with limited technical skills or understanding, two brothers who are a little more up to speed and then all their children from ages 5-18 (including my own) who are even more adjusted to tech but lacking in worldly experience and the ability to see much outside of themselves. (which I don\u2019t think is a bad thing, it\u2019s just something that comes with age.)\n\nAll this being said, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with them over the years and while I haven\u2019t pushed, or really even willfully brought up my experience and knowledge of the crypto space I\u2019m seeing some very interesting developments mostly as an observer.   \nWhen we first got married, everyone in her family was blissfully unaware of Bitcoin or even a cursory understanding of the way our current (United States) Monetary Policy worked.   \n5 years ago was when I first started hearing rumbles of the idea of \u201cbitcoin\u201d from my in-laws and even though at that time there were many other coins, including Ethereum, everything was still just talked about in context of Bitcoin, but even then it was mostly talked about in terms of disbelief and dismissal. \u201c\u201dIt\u2019s not backed by anything\u201d, \u201cThese people throwing their money at this are idiots\u201d, \u201cThis is just like that beanie baby fad.\u201d etc.   \n\n\n3 years ago - Was still a time of these Bitcoin Centrist views but slightly more muted in it\u2019s dismissal and disbelief, but I think, more importantly, this was a key moment of understanding of the united states monetary policies especially in regards to the printing of money and the ever increasing debt that no one including politicians seemed to care about anymore. \n\n2 years ago - The first mention of \u201ccrypto\u201d as a whole. The idea that other crypto currencies exist had entered their collective consciousness, but still it was met with mostly this idea that it was this fake internet money. They realized I knew a lot about the topic and this is probably when I was first questioned about it in a very generalized sense. They were searching for answers to questions that they hadn\u2019t even properly formulated in their minds. Now maybe it was the way in which I explained it, but I think it was also that the topic was too nuanced and forgive the pun, ethereal, for them to fully grasp. \u201cBlockchain\u201d, \u201cCryptographically secure\u201d, \u201ctransparent accounting ledger\u201d were just too out of reach.   \n\n\n1 year ago - Still in disbelief but ever more muted in their assertions, the idea that crypto was real and here to stay was not something they could see in their mind\u2019s eye. News about the previous crash gave them confidence that this was the \u201ctruth\u201d and they assumed they could forget about it. \n\n6 months ago - This is when things really started to \u201cclick\u201d as the ever increasing US and global debt from money printing due to Covid-19 stimulus meshed with the idea that having something whose supply was \u201cset\u201d could be useful as a hedge. Even still, there was still a part of them that thought \u201cwell that\u2019s why Gold is useful\u201d and I politely just ask them what happens if China or Russia or even the US find a mine of gold that increases the supply by an order of magnitude which gave them pause and that was that. As news and media started the most recent cycle that I believe is the catalyst for our current bull run is when they started to see that maybe, just maybe this \u201ccrypto thing\u201d wasn\u2019t going away. \n\nToday - I wasn\u2019t bombarded with amazing questions or anything but I could tell it was something everyone was interested in learning and hearing me speak about it. Everyone was standing and sitting around in the living room, talking about their own things; a question sprung from the mouth of one of my brother in-laws. \u201cHey, childsp, you're in this crypto stuff right? What gives crypto it\u2019s value.\u201d Everyone stopped what they were talking about and ears perked up, eyes were on me. It was a very interesting moment for me and one that I\u2019ll remember for a long time, to see the collective group interested in my response, about crypto! I delicately formulated a response to their level as to not see their eyes glaze over and told them that it \u201cdepends on the crypto\u201d Some crypto like Bitcoin sees its value through a limited and defined maximum supply. While other crypto, like Ethereum see their value through usage of applications on chain. I used a simplistic idea of people paying for bandwidth to connect to the internet. If there is only so much bandwidth and demand is increasing then price must follow suit to reach an equilibrium. \n\nThis seemed to satisfy the group and we talked a bit more about crypto in a very generalized sense.(At one point there was even a joke about Doge coin!!!) \n\nIn the end, one of my brother in-laws said that he knew \u201cthat crypto was real and was here to stay\u201d and that he\u2019d been trying to keep up with it but that it was difficult and a little over his head. \n\nTo me, I think this is just the beginning, and to see from a very analytical, observer frame of mind; where we\u2019ve come from, to where we are now, in the general consciousness is really amazing. We are seeing an exponential curve developing in the collective minds of those \u201con the outside\u201d and adoption is nipping at the heels. \n\nI\u2019ll be keeping my observer hat on and continuing to only respond when asked about the topic of crypto at least until I get asked about a dapp and how they can get onboarded, as that\u2019s when I\u2019ll feel like we\u2019ve \u201cmade it\u201d but for the moment, it\u2019s truly amazing to see the progress.  \n\n\nAs a side note, I\u2019m extremely interested in the thoughts and experiences of others on this sub.
