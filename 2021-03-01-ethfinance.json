I would like to drop this secret, insightful, ALPHA LEAK...\n\n**Sometimes, number go down!**\n\nThat is financial advice.\n\n**That said, significant updates this week include:**\n\n~ The first milestone has been crossed off of this timeline! That's right, the **EIP-1559 community call happened on Friday.** A summary of stakeholder positions from this call [can be found here.](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/1559-outreach) The highlight was undoubtedly u/DCinvestor 's [mic drop moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdXhL6VR0mU&t=2297s&ab_channel=EthereumCatHerders). Kudos to u/Bob-Rossi for the outreach effort in the daily leading up to the call.\n\n~ Tim Beiko posted [a big update on EIP-1559](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/1559-updates/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40timbeiko%2F1559-update-007) what seems like forever ago, but was only last week. The update is that large state testing is pretty much done. This has meant that Tim has **formally [submitted the EIP for inclusion](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/254) in this summer's London Eth1 upgrade.** This doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, but the groundwork is now done. Well done to Tim and team for the absolute massive amount of work done on this so far.\n\n~ Plans for the Eth2 summer upgrade, HF1, are being further fleshed out. On the Eth2 dev call this week the intention was laid clear to **target June for HF1.** A high level plan has been put forward [here.](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/hf1-plan)\nAlso it looks like star names [will be adopted](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vhZTXcTRlFvOOFTXpeD-S52-hK3F6Huq-vp-26YeWJI/edit#gid=0) as the naming convention going forward... bummer for those who wanted Seasame Street muppets. \n\n~ No change for either the upcoming Berlin Eth1 upgrade or The Merge. **They remain on track** as per below.\n\n~ Rocketpool continued to produce encouraging news. The project is still on track for late March/early April go-live. The **final beta will shortly drop**, which should be near identical to mainnet, and to include RocketPool's tokenomics model. This should run for a few weeks prior to live launch. Meanwhile the Sigma Prime audit is near to completion with the Consensys audit planned to kick off 7 March.\n\nIn Layer 2 roadmap news:\n\n~ dYdX becomes the second item in this roadmap to achieved! This week they **[delivered the alpha launch of their zk-rollups solution](https://dydx.exchange/blog/alpha)** (via StarkWare) for cross margined perpetuals. Defi degens get in for cheap trades! More trading pairs to be added ongoing. The full live launch should happen in a few weeks once the solution is tested and stable.\n\n~ And leaving the best till last, such is their confidence in their own zk-rollups solution, **Optimism [has brought forward](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/dope-hires-moar-mainnet-in-march-174fa8966361) their full mainnet release from April to March.** That means no more public testnet. Going straight to live.\n\nThat's three things crossed off the plan for the best reason (teams fucking delivered) this week.

I would like to drop this secret, insightful, ALPHA LEAK...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sometimes, number go down!</strong></p>\n\n<p>That is financial advice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That said, significant updates this week include:</strong></p>\n\n<p>~ The first milestone has been crossed off of this timeline! That&#39;s right, the <strong>EIP-1559 community call happened on Friday.</strong> A summary of stakeholder positions from this call <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/1559-outreach\">can be found here.</a> The highlight was undoubtedly <a href=\"/u/DCinvestor\">u/DCinvestor</a> &#39;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdXhL6VR0mU&amp;t=2297s&amp;ab_channel=EthereumCatHerders\">mic drop moment</a>. Kudos to <a href=\"/u/Bob-Rossi\">u/Bob-Rossi</a> for the outreach effort in the daily leading up to the call.</p>\n\n<p>~ Tim Beiko posted <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/1559-updates/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40timbeiko%2F1559-update-007\">a big update on EIP-1559</a> what seems like forever ago, but was only last week. The update is that large state testing is pretty much done. This has meant that Tim has <strong>formally <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/254\">submitted the EIP for inclusion</a> in this summer&#39;s London Eth1 upgrade.</strong> This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it will happen, but the groundwork is now done. Well done to Tim and team for the absolute massive amount of work done on this so far.</p>\n\n<p>~ Plans for the Eth2 summer upgrade, HF1, are being further fleshed out. On the Eth2 dev call this week the intention was laid clear to <strong>target June for HF1.</strong> A high level plan has been put forward <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/hf1-plan\">here.</a>\nAlso it looks like star names <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vhZTXcTRlFvOOFTXpeD-S52-hK3F6Huq-vp-26YeWJI/edit#gid=0\">will be adopted</a> as the naming convention going forward... bummer for those who wanted Seasame Street muppets. </p>\n\n<p>~ No change for either the upcoming Berlin Eth1 upgrade or The Merge. <strong>They remain on track</strong> as per below.</p>\n\n<p>~ Rocketpool continued to produce encouraging news. The project is still on track for late March/early April go-live. The <strong>final beta will shortly drop</strong>, which should be near identical to mainnet, and to include RocketPool&#39;s tokenomics model. This should run for a few weeks prior to live launch. Meanwhile the Sigma Prime audit is near to completion with the Consensys audit planned to kick off 7 March.</p>\n\n<p>In Layer 2 roadmap news:</p>\n\n<p>~ dYdX becomes the second item in this roadmap to achieved! This week they <strong><a href=\"https://dydx.exchange/blog/alpha\">delivered the alpha launch of their zk-rollups solution</a></strong> (via StarkWare) for cross margined perpetuals. Defi degens get in for cheap trades! More trading pairs to be added ongoing. The full live launch should happen in a few weeks once the solution is tested and stable.</p>\n\n<p>~ And leaving the best till last, such is their confidence in their own zk-rollups solution, <strong>Optimism <a href=\"https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/dope-hires-moar-mainnet-in-march-174fa8966361\">has brought forward</a> their full mainnet release from April to March.</strong> That means no more public testnet.

I'd been watching from the sidelines for a while and I had a small amount saved, so the timing felt right. I bought ETH, ADA (sorry) and EGLD (double sorry). As I mentioned in this thread in the past days, I flipped all my ADA for ETH over the weekend which has helped increase my position, which was the plan I had in mind.

My initial investment was fairly small and due to this I am willing to take a few more risks to get this goal. I'm getting close now. Maybe I should already just hold and DCA from here but I still have my EGLD that I will most likely flip to ETH at some point too.\n\nLong term.. I'm trying to figure out what role crypto has to play in my own ventures when it comes to business. I'm lucky in that I have a job that I really enjoy but on the side, I have a few things running and I guess like everyone on here, I see ample opportunity to merge my interest in this space with my interest in other things.
