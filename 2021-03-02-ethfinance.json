If you don&#39;t get something, just make an assumption and move on. You can always dive deeper and go back. I skipped a lot of the math and proof stuff towards the middle and bottom after reading the general overview at top.</p>\n\n<p>Vitalik says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But even with these factors taken into account, scalability gains of over 100x are expected to be the norm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I think even though 100x sounds like a fake round oversimplified number, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll use. It seems like a (more) educated guesstimate based on the traffic rollups will see. No need to push the best-case scenario, only ETH-ETH transfers. Clearly most of the blockspace right now is DeFi stuff that are complex contract interactions. So depending on how you measure, 140x isn&#39;t incorrect, but let&#39;s not totally overstate things. It&#39;s a huge improvement, and I think it&#39;s fine to be a little reserved at <em>only</em> 100x \ud83d\ude44.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-02 04:26:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gpeoz0g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lvv97v","parent_id":"t1_gpefcb8","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/hereimalive","body":"I've tried to verify my Kraken account on the 14th of February, it's now March 2nd and no response from support.\n\nWhat is /u/krakensupport doing with this support?

The most important thing to them is fees, right?  OK, what are the largest fees they have to deal with?  Well, currently TX fees, but that will (hopefully) be addressed.  What's the next largest problem?  Interestingly, it's definitely not LP fees or a potential UNI fee, its \\*slippage\\*.   \n\n\nAnd what causes slippage?  Presence or absence of sufficient liquidity in the pool. Boom that's the most important thing.  What attracts liquidity?  The best fees for LPs.  So you see, we've defined the tug of rope between LPs and users.  However, we're not currently optimized.  Slippage in the system benefits ZERO people, except arb bots.\n\nAs a thought experiment, excluding tx fees, think about total fees charged to the user (in % terms) on a cartesian plane.  The X axis is LP+UNI fees; the Y axis is typical slippage.  The product of X\\*Y is the total fee right?  Like the area of a right quadrilateral.  It follows then, that if I increase LP fees by any % and slippage reduces by any smaller % then this is better off for the user as a whole and obviously better off the LPers.  We should aim to optimize this completely, because, again, slippage benefits only arbitrageurs, who are not stakeholders in the uniswap ecosystem.  Aim to reduce slippage at whatever cost that does not increase the LP+Uni fee in a greater manner.\n\nGuess what, the \"end game\" for that optimization is a one-protocol solution.

That's why I think Uniswap is here to stay.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Interesting and valid POV, here&#39;s what changed my mind specifically for UNI:</p>\n\n<p>Put yourself in the uniswap user&#39;s shoes.  The most important thing to them is fees, right?  OK, what are the largest fees they have to deal with?  Well, currently TX fees, but that will (hopefully) be addressed.  What&#39;s the next largest problem?  Interestingly, it&#39;s definitely not LP fees or a potential UNI fee, its *slippage*.   </p>\n\n<p>And what causes slippage?  Presence or absence of sufficient liquidity in the pool. Boom that&#39;s the most important thing.  What attracts liquidity?  The best fees for LPs.  So you see, we&#39;ve defined the tug of rope between LPs and users.  However, we&#39;re not currently optimized.  Slippage in the system benefits ZERO people, except arb bots.</p>\n\n<p>As a thought experiment, excluding tx fees, think about total fees charged to the user (in % terms) on a cartesian plane.  The X axis is LP+UNI fees; the Y axis is typical slippage.  The product of X*Y is the total fee right?  Like the area of a right quadrilateral.  It follows then, that if I increase LP fees by any % and slippage reduces by any smaller % then this is better off for the user as a whole and obviously better off the LPers.  We should aim to optimize this completely, because, again, slippage benefits only arbitrageurs, who are not stakeholders in the uniswap ecosystem.  Aim to reduce slippage at whatever cost that does not increase the LP+Uni fee in a greater manner.</p>\n\n<p>Guess what, the &quot;end game&quot; for that optimization is a one-protocol solution.  Winner takes all (most) liquidity.  That&#39;s why I think Uniswap is here to stay.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-02 10:29:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gpfxcva","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lvv97v","parent_id":"t1_gpfjz6n","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/BeastroMath","body":"Pulling a massive liquidity pool to another protocol would require greater incentive than the current system.

A lot of people got burned by that in the last bull run.  They spent the bull run swapping ETH, BTC, and alts back and forth to make gains on the ratio volatility.  What they didn't take into account though was that each of these was a taxable event, so after the market crashed in Dec/Jan, suddenly they were responsible for tens of thousands of dollars in paper gains they made on their trades during the bull run that now didn't exist anymore since the prices tanked.  Sure, the next year they would have been able to write off some of those losses, but by that point it was too late, they had to sell off their entire stack and in some cases *still* owed thousands of dollars on top of that, all to pay income tax on gains they never actually had because it was all still in crypto.\n\nI think next year some of the people here are going to run into tax challenges as well with all of the experimenting they're doing with L2.
