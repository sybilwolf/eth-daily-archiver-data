So whereas Bitcoin has 21 million identical coins, this is a unique coin of its own on a blockchain like Ethereum. The idea here is that he is destroying his ownership of the original and creating ownership of what he destroyed and putting it into a unique piece of digital art which is stored on the blockchain which is basically a super secure shared database which will keep track of who owns it. Let's go through the pros and cons:\n\n>**Cons:**\n\n>1. He's destroying the real artwork. Arguably, this destroys the value as the official Banksy piece no longer exists. This is an extremely valid argument in my opinion. However, there is a counter argument below...\n\n>**Pros:**\n\n>1. What he is doing is a world first, which arguably gives the digial token (NFT) its own value as it is representative of this historical moment and of the former piece of physical art. It is worth noting that this is actually very similar to how new Bitcoins are made. To earn a Bitcoin, you effectively burn thousands of dollars of electricity and get rewarded with a digital coin which in effect is representative of the electricity burned. This is just burning artwork instead of electricity in order to try and give a digital token value.\n\n>2. Ownership and authenticity of this NFT is now permanently tracked completely transparently on a shared public database like the Ethereum blockchain (he may use a different blockchain but by far and away the biggest and most common one for this sort of use case is Ethereum). This means that the big issue of art fraud is gone with NFTs. You can now verify that the token is representative of this real life valuable artwork being burned.\n\n>3. NFTs can be used as collateral to get loans in DeFi (Decentralised Finance which is basically getting loans or earning interest + much more without a bank or custodian via the Ethereum blockchain). This means that now if people do give this NFT real value, then this kid could leverage its value to get a loan and using the NFT/artwork as collateral. This isn't easy to do with real artwork but it can be done instantly and transparently on the blockchain.\n\n>I get that this is all very speculative as is most things crypto related, but this is actually a relatively historic moment, like it or not. We are starting to see the debate of should digital things have real value. I totally understand why most people right now will say that this is stupid. But ask yourself, will the kid who pays real money for hardly useful fortnite skins pay money for an NFT artwork which he can display and show off to his friends remotely in VR worlds like Decentraland or just by sending them a link to his wallet proving his ownership of the NFT? Probably. Even if you or I don't see much value in it yet, as this becomes the norm and especially as kids are brought up around more things with digital value I expect NFTs to start being seen as valuable by most people. However, it will be a slow process in my opinion and much like the price and interest in Bitcoin has, I think NFTs will have big boom and bust cycles driven by speculation before they finally work their way into a normal place in society.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I decided to go and spread the good word over in <a href=\"/r/Banksy\">r/Banksy</a> after someone decided to burn a real Banksy artwork and then mint an NFT of it/of that moment.

This is just burning artwork instead of electricity in order to try and give a digital token value.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ownership and authenticity of this NFT is now permanently tracked completely transparently on a shared public database like the Ethereum blockchain (he may use a different blockchain but by far and away the biggest and most common one for this sort of use case is Ethereum). This means that the big issue of art fraud is gone with NFTs. You can now verify that the token is representative of this real life valuable artwork being burned.</p></li>\n<li><p>NFTs can be used as collateral to get loans in DeFi (Decentralised Finance which is basically getting loans or earning interest + much more without a bank or custodian via the Ethereum blockchain). This means that now if people do give this NFT real value, then this kid could leverage its value to get a loan and using the NFT/artwork as collateral. This isn&#39;t easy to do with real artwork but it can be done instantly and transparently on the blockchain.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I get that this is all very speculative as is most things crypto related, but this is actually a relatively historic moment, like it or not. We are starting to see the debate of should digital things have real value. I totally understand why most people right now will say that this is stupid. But ask yourself, will the kid who pays real money for hardly useful fortnite skins pay money for an NFT artwork which he can display and show off to his friends remotely in VR worlds like Decentraland or just by sending them a link to his wallet proving his ownership of the NFT? Probably. Even if you or I don&#39;t see much value in it yet, as this becomes the norm and especially as kids are brought up around more things with digital value I expect NFTs to start being seen as valuable by most people. However, it will be a slow process in my opinion and much like the price and interest in Bitcoin has, I think NFTs will have big boom and bust cycles driven by speculation before they finally work their way into a normal place in society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-04 02:48:51","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-04 03:06:21","id":"gpn27gd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lxdzux","parent_id":"t3_lxdzux","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Phonethic","body":"What's funny to me is how that community can say a piece of art has value, but an NFT is \"just a jpeg or an mp4\".

So whereas Bitcoin has 21 million identical coins, this is a unique coin of its own on a blockchain like Ethereum. The idea here is that he is destroying his ownership of the original and creating ownership of what he destroyed and putting it into a unique piece of digital art which is stored on the blockchain which is basically a super secure shared database which will keep track of who owns it. Let's go through the pros and cons:\n\n>**Cons:**\n\n>1. He's destroying the real artwork. Arguably, this destroys the value as the official Banksy piece no longer exists. This is an extremely valid argument in my opinion. However, there is a counter argument below...\n\n>**Pros:**\n\n>1. What he is doing is a world first, which arguably gives the digial token (NFT) its own value as it is representative of this historical moment and of the former piece of physical art. It is worth noting that this is actually very similar to how new Bitcoins are made. To earn a Bitcoin, you effectively burn thousands of dollars of electricity and get rewarded with a digital coin which in effect is representative of the electricity burned. This is just burning artwork instead of electricity in order to try and give a digital token value.\n\n>2. Ownership and authenticity of this NFT is now permanently tracked completely transparently on a shared public database like the Ethereum blockchain (he may use a different blockchain but by far and away the biggest and most common one for this sort of use case is Ethereum). This means that the big issue of art fraud is gone with NFTs. You can now verify that the token is representative of this real life valuable artwork being burned.\n\n>3. NFTs can be used as collateral to get loans in DeFi (Decentralised Finance which is basically getting loans or earning interest + much more without a bank or custodian via the Ethereum blockchain). This means that now if people do give this NFT real value, then this kid could leverage its value to get a loan and using the NFT/artwork as collateral. This isn't easy to do with real artwork but it can be done instantly and transparently on the blockchain.\n\n>I get that this is all very speculative as is most things crypto related, but this is actually a relatively historic moment, like it or not. We are starting to see the debate of should digital things have real value. I totally understand why most people right now will say that this is stupid. But ask yourself, will the kid who pays real money for hardly useful fortnite skins pay money for an NFT artwork which he can display and show off to his friends remotely in VR worlds like Decentraland or just by sending them a link to his wallet proving his ownership of the NFT? Probably. Even if you or I don't see much value in it yet, as this becomes the norm and especially as kids are brought up around more things with digital value I expect NFTs to start being seen as valuable by most people. However, it will be a slow process in my opinion and much like the price and interest in Bitcoin has, I think NFTs will have big boom and bust cycles driven by speculation before they finally work their way into a normal place in society.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Interesting.

DOT, SOL, ATOM all have contracts in active use (i mean DOT is lagging on mainnet launch but the code is active). \n\nSo probably what you are missing is that this space seems to value the \"unknown\" over the known when it comes to smart contract platforms. It's actually kind of simple really. With no smart contracts, a coin can be touted as anything people want to make it to be. \"ADA/EOS/Tron/DOT will have more TPS and X&Y are developing on it and it will over take ETH\". It's all theory and hype and easy to get people excited. Once that chain actually launces and people see actual stats of no one using it it fails.

That is getting it publicity and money flowing in from those &quot;BTC went from $1 to $20k why can&#39;t ADA?&quot; types. We saw what happened to DOT when it split.</p>\n\n<p>I think my post gave off a vibe that I like ADA more then I do, I really just think that on 3/4/2021 ADA being in the Top 10 isn&#39;t that unreasonable. It&#39;s a speculative play. And I would go back to my point I have a hard time finding 10 coins I&#39;d prefer to invest in over ADA. Definitely not 25 coins, that&#39;s for sure. (Again, I don&#39;t own any though)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What am I missing? ADA doesn&#39;t have smart contracts yet. DOT, SOL, ATOM all have contracts in active use (i mean DOT is lagging on mainnet launch but the code is active). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So probably what you are missing is that this space seems to value the &quot;unknown&quot; over the known when it comes to smart contract platforms. It&#39;s actually kind of simple really. With no smart contracts, a coin can be touted as anything people want to make it to be. &quot;ADA/EOS/Tron/DOT will have more TPS and X&amp;Y are developing on it and it will over take ETH&quot;. It&#39;s all theory and hype and easy to get people excited. Once that chain actually launces and people see actual stats of no one using it it fails.
