I saw the Cardano remark the author made as an off-the-cuff memey joke and just overlooked it. I was more referring to the actual network criticisms. about it being slow and expensive. Yes you&#39;re right about Cardanos performance if it were on an equal traffic footing, but its still not unfair for them to say that Eth could become a huge storage facility for value while the smaller less bloated tokens become the more heavily traded ones. All speculation of course, who can say what kind of performace Eth will be putting out by then, the very thought of it being &#39;just a storage facility&#39; might become laughable down the line.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-05 09:08:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gpsj7lh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ly5fug","parent_id":"t1_gpsi9p7","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-05 16:26:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gpu2s6s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ly5fug","parent_id":"t3_ly5fug","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/MorganZero","body":"You can never fully insulate yourself from the risk of the price dropping.

You can also \"stake\" your ghst tokens to earn raffle tickets to win exclusive wearables which boost your pets stats (or sell the raffles for ghst).
