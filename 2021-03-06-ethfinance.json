Die Wahrheit liegt vermutlich, wie bei vielen Kryptothemen, irgendwo dazwischen. Was in jedem Fall stimmt: Es geht um ziemlich viel Geld. \n\nDer Reihe nach. NFT ist die Abk\u00fcrzung von Non-Fungible Token, auf Deutsch: nicht austauschbare Token. Vereinfacht gesagt handelt es sich dabei um eine Wertmarke f\u00fcr ein einzigartiges, digitales Objekt.\u00a0 \n\nVielleicht hilft ein Vergleich: Geld ist austauschbar; es ist egal, ob man einen F\u00fcnfzigeuroschein in der Tasche hat oder 50 Eineurom\u00fcnzen im Sparschwein oder 50 Euro auf dem Konto. Der Wert bleibt gleich. Ein Gem\u00e4lde von Picasso ist dagegen nicht austauschbar. Man kann das Bild nicht mit 50 kleineren Picassos austauschen und behaupten, sie w\u00e4ren gleich viel wert. Der Verm\u00f6genswert ist n\u00e4mlich in dem Fall an ein konkretes, physisches Objekt gekoppelt \u2013 und ergibt sich letztlich daraus, was andere Menschen bereit sind, daf\u00fcr zu zahlen. \n\nBei digitalen G\u00fctern ist die Sache mit Besitz und Verm\u00f6genswert schwieriger. Klar, es gibt Urheber- und Nutzungsrechte und man kann so ziemlich alles digital verkaufen, sofern es einen Markt daf\u00fcr gibt. Aber anders als der Picasso an der Wand, lassen sich digitale Fotos, Videos, Texte und Musik einfach kopieren, was der Idee von Echtheit und Besitz entgegensteht. H\u00e4ufig gen\u00fcgt ein Mausklick auf \"Speichern unter\" und schon hat man eine exakte Kopie erstellt. Wie will man da sagen, wem etwa ein einzelnes Gif von Nyan Cat, der durchs Weltall fliegenden Pop-Tart-Katze, wirklich geh\u00f6rt? Wie will man festlegen, was eine einzelne Datei wert ist, wenn es sie auf unz\u00e4hligen Websites zum Download gibt? \n\n\"Digitales Zeug, das einem wirklich geh\u00f6rt\"\n\nHier kommen NFTs ins Spiel und mit ihnen die Blockchain-Technologie.\u00a0 \n\nKryptow\u00e4hrungen wie Bitcoin oder Ether basieren jeweils auf einer eigenen Blockchain, die eine Art digitales Kassenbuch ist: Jede Transaktion wird als ein eigener Block in der Blockchain gespeichert und mit einem einmaligen kryptografischen Wert signiert. Man kann sich die Blockchain also wie eine immer l\u00e4nger werdende Perlenkette von \u00dcberweisungen vorstellen. Ist ein Block erst einmal hinzugef\u00fcgt, kann man ihn nicht mehr l\u00f6schen, denn dann w\u00fcrde die gesamte Kette rei\u00dfen. Das macht die Blockchain sicher vor Angriffen und F\u00e4lschungen.\u00a0 \n\nNon-Fungible Tokens sind spezielle Bl\u00f6cke in dieser Blockchain, die nicht f\u00fcr \u00dcberweisungen von A nach B stehen, sondern einen Verm\u00f6genswert, einen Besitzer und ein bestimmtes digitales Objekt miteinander verkn\u00fcpfen. Sie sind eine digitale Darstellung eines Verm\u00f6genswertes, oder anders gesagt: Sie sind digitales Zeug, das einem auch wirklich geh\u00f6rt, wie das Monopol-Magazin einen NFT-Sammler zitiert. \n\n\nBleiben wir beim Beispiel Nyan Cat. Das animierte Gif tauchte 2011 das erste Mal im Internet auf. Es wurde seitdem unz\u00e4hlige Male geteilt und kopiert und w\u00e4hrend es einen Urheber hat, n\u00e4mlich einen Mann namens Chris Torres, hatte das Gif keinen wirklichen Verm\u00f6genswert. Bis jetzt. Im Februar hat Torres, passend zum zehnj\u00e4hrigen Jubil\u00e4um der Nyan Cat, die Animation noch einmal \u00fcberarbeitet und eine neue, qualitativ hochwertigere Version erstellt. Die hat er anschlie\u00dfend \u00fcber die Kryptokunstplattform Foundation versteigert: F\u00fcr 300 Ether, was zum Kaufzeitpunkt umgerechnet fast 600.000 US-Dollar waren. Die gesamte Transaktion steht nun in der Ethereum-Blockchain, f\u00fcr alle sichtbar: 0x7Eb28B2f14A59789ec4c782A5DD957F9C8F33f6b hat das Werk in Form eines NFTs erworben und somit zum Wertgegenstand gemacht.\n\nEine unbekannte Person hat also mehr als eine halbe Million f\u00fcr ein animiertes Gif ausgegeben, das sich weiterhin jeder per Rechtsklick direkt von der Auktionswebsite auf die Festplatte speichern k\u00f6nnte? Ja, so ist es. Der K\u00e4ufer oder die K\u00e4uferin kann nicht verhindern, dass die neue Nyan Cat weiter kopiert und verteilt wird. Er oder sie besitzt weder die Nutzungsrechte noch das Markenzeichen der Nyan Cat, sondern lediglich den Besitznachweis f\u00fcr eine einzelne, konkrete digitale Manifestation des Werkes. So, wie man bei klassischen Gem\u00e4lden den Besitz gew\u00f6hnlich mit einer Urkunde kl\u00e4rt, garantiert ein NFT: Dieses bestimmte Teil geh\u00f6rt mir! Sie sind also ein Weg, um Knappheit dort zu schaffen, wo es bislang keine gab. \n\n6 Millionen Dollar f\u00fcr ein animiertes Video\n\nNun k\u00f6nnte man annehmen, bei der ganzen Sache handle es sich um einen dieser typischen Internetgags. Jemand mit viel Geld kauft ein bekanntes Meme-Gif, weil es eben geht. Haha, sehr witzig. Doch Nyan Cat ist kein Einzelfall: In den vergangenen Monaten und Wochen gab es zahlreiche NFTs, die verkauft wurden. So hat erst vergangene Woche die S\u00e4ngerin Grimes Kryptokunst im Wert von sechs Millionen US-Dollar versteigert, darunter Fotos und kurze Videos. Ein einzelnes, animiertes Video des Grafikdesigners Mike \"Beeple\" Winkelmann ging f\u00fcr 6,6 Millionen US-Dollar \u00fcber den Tisch. Das sind Preise, wie man sie aus der traditionellen Kunstszene kennt. \n\nNFTs eignen sich aber nicht nur f\u00fcr visuelle Kunst. NBA Top Shot, eine Art digitales Kartensammelspiel, erfreut sich derzeit gro\u00dfer Beliebtheit. Schon seit 2017 gibt es die Website CryptoKitties, dank der man putzige Katzen \u00fcber die Blockchain z\u00fcchten und gewinnbringend weiterverkaufen kann (der Autor dieser Zeilen hat seine Zucht damals leider vorschnell abgebrochen und deshalb keinen Profit gemacht). Auch Influencer entdecken NFTs f\u00fcr sich, etwa der YouTuber Logan Paul oder der deutsche Fynn Kliemann, der Jingles \u00fcber die Blockchain verkauft. Gerade k\u00fcndigten die Kings of Leon an, ihr neues Album auch als NFT herauszubringen. Als limitierte Edition, nat\u00fcrlich. Man sieht: NFTs lassen sich theoretisch mit jeglichen digitalen G\u00fctern verkn\u00fcpfen und fast w\u00f6chentlich erscheinen neue Plattformen, die sich auf Kryptokunst spezialisiert haben.\n\n\nNFTs sind auch eine Geldanlage\n\nUm die Frage nach dem Sinn des Ganzen zu beantworten, muss man sowohl die K\u00e4ufer- als auch Verk\u00e4uferseite betrachten. Die K\u00e4uferin eines NFTs erh\u00e4lt, wie schon erw\u00e4hnt, zum einen den Besitzanspruch. Ob es sich um einen Picasso in \u00d6l oder eine Regenbogen kackende Katze als animiertes Gif handelt, ist in dem Fall egal: Entscheidend ist, dass es einen Besitzer gibt. NFTs geben den K\u00e4uferinnen also gewisserma\u00dfen das Angeberrecht, weil sie nachweisen k\u00f6nnen, dass ihre Kopie die einzig authentische ist, auch wenn es m\u00f6glicherweise Zigtausende andere Kopien gibt. Klingt absurd, aber so funktioniert letztlich der Kunstmarkt: Der ideelle Wert \u00fcberwiegt h\u00e4ufig den materiellen Wert. \n\nZum anderen erwerben die K\u00e4ufer ein Spekulationsobjekt. Denn NFTs lassen sich nat\u00fcrlich weiterverkaufen und man darf darauf hoffen, dass die Nachfrage steigt und man sie zu einem sp\u00e4teren Zeitpunkt gewinnbringend verkaufen kann. Hier spielt nat\u00fcrlich auch der Hype um Kryptow\u00e4hrungen insgesamt eine Rolle: Denn wer ohnehin in Ether oder Bitcoin in der Hoffnung auf steigende Kurse investieren m\u00f6chte, erh\u00e4lt mit NFTs zus\u00e4tzliche M\u00f6glichkeiten, das Geld anzulegen. Das bedeutet gleichzeitig aber auch Risiko: Die 300 Ether, die etwa f\u00fcr die Nyan Cat ausgegeben wurden, sind inzwischen fast 150.000 Dollar weniger wert als noch zum Zeitpunkt der Auktion. \n\nDie Verk\u00e4ufer, also in dem Fall die K\u00fcnstlerinnen und K\u00fcnstler, erhalten mit NFTs dagegen die M\u00f6glichkeit, durch k\u00fcnstliche Knappheit den Wert ihrer digitalen Arbeiten zu steigern. Denn es macht einen Unterschied, ob Sie ein Werk einfach ins Internet stellen beziehungsweise f\u00fcr einige Euro unz\u00e4hlige Kopien auf ihrer Website verkaufen. Oder ob sie eben nur eine einzige echte Kopie als NFT anbieten und somit Sammlerinnen und Spekulanten, aber eben auch treue Fans auf den Plan rufen. NFTs sind also eine neue Einnahmequelle. Sie k\u00f6nnen zudem so festgelegt werden, dass die Urheber nicht nur eine einmalige Zahlung erhalten, sondern immer anteilig dann, wenn das NFT den Besitzer wechselt. Das w\u00e4re quasi eine neue Form von Tantiemen, die bei jedem Wiederverkauf anfallen. Man kann verstehen, weshalb das Konzept gerade in diesen schweren Zeiten f\u00fcr die Kulturindustrie so attraktiv ist und weshalb aktuell viele K\u00fcnstler auf den NFT-Zug aufspringen.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If only there was a token I could send you... </p>\n\n<p>Had to split the article.

Am I missing something?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-06 08:13:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gpz3jz9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lyvdf8","parent_id":"t1_gpyd60r","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/offthewall1066","body":"It\u2019s literally all low effort ADA shilling all day.

So, if you farm 3 Sushi tomorrow, you will be able to harvest only one Sushi; the other two will be locked for six months.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-06 21:13:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gq2if5c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lyvdf8","parent_id":"t1_gq2hlud","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"So I received an amount of SLP on my metamask, would staking this amount correspond to the APY?\n\nEdit: I re-read your comment, so based on what you are saying the rewards would be the 0.xxx per 1,000.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I received an amount of SLP on my metamask, would staking this amount correspond to the APY?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I re-read your comment, so based on what you are saying the rewards would be the 0.xxx per 1,000.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-06 21:20:48","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-06 21:29:03","id":"gq2j3xz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lyvdf8","parent_id":"t1_gq2if5c","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Brassica7","body":"The APY is (I believe) based on the value of the coins you put in the pool. \n\nFor example: you add $5000 worth of ETH and $5000 worth of Aave to the ETH/Aave pool on Sushiswap.
