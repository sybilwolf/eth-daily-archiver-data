The most likely solution to save it and us, it's the Nobel price winning game theory of co2 bonus Malus tax.\n\nThe question was if there would be a game theory stable solution. Because right now it doesn't make sense to save co2, let the others do it. And the rainforest is only dead capital standing around doing nothing but producing free oxygen for everyone. Meanwhile cows and soy brings in cash. So the children of the farmers can buy school books and escape the mess.\n\nNow you could run after these stuff and give handouts but that is slow and inefficient and it's negative perceived charity. Begging for money.\n\nNow to sum it up and make it a bit shorter (I wrote long and lengthy descriptions about the necessary properties a solution would have to work by itself, but few read it anyway):\n\nYou need a solution that works by itself, is self reinforcing, does work on a national regulation level but exhibits if effects globally, it's fair, doesn't let jobs run away abroad where it's cheaper, and some more stuff.\n\nNow with bonus malus approach it's a zero sum tax. No money is gained by the government. If one country implements it you need to pay for the dirt that you produce. Meanwhile if you help save co2 or in general GHG you get payed the money the other had given. Now the nice part. Annother form is to give out the money to EVERYONE in cash. Like a dividend. Swiss does this already today with their VOC (volatile organic components, industrial stuff) and EVERY Swiss person gets the cash for it (around 50-80chf/year). Not much but you didn't even know the component until today. Could be like a basic income if you don't spend it on the other hand on co2 outputs like gas.\n\nYou need to implement it on import and export. WTO already approved it as a fair tax (hence no trade war sueings). Why is this important?

The most likely solution to save it and us, it&#39;s the Nobel price winning game theory of co2 bonus Malus tax.</p>\n\n<p>The question was if there would be a game theory stable solution. Because right now it doesn&#39;t make sense to save co2, let the others do it. And the rainforest is only dead capital standing around doing nothing but producing free oxygen for everyone. Meanwhile cows and soy brings in cash. So the children of the farmers can buy school books and escape the mess.</p>\n\n<p>Now you could run after these stuff and give handouts but that is slow and inefficient and it&#39;s negative perceived charity. Begging for money.</p>\n\n<p>Now to sum it up and make it a bit shorter (I wrote long and lengthy descriptions about the necessary properties a solution would have to work by itself, but few read it anyway):</p>\n\n<p>You need a solution that works by itself, is self reinforcing, does work on a national regulation level but exhibits if effects globally, it&#39;s fair, doesn&#39;t let jobs run away abroad where it&#39;s cheaper, and some more stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Now with bonus malus approach it&#39;s a zero sum tax. No money is gained by the government. If one country implements it you need to pay for the dirt that you produce. Meanwhile if you help save co2 or in general GHG you get payed the money the other had given. Now the nice part. Annother form is to give out the money to EVERYONE in cash. Like a dividend. Swiss does this already today with their VOC (volatile organic components, industrial stuff) and EVERY Swiss person gets the cash for it (around 50-80chf/year). Not much but you didn&#39;t even know the component until today. Could be like a basic income if you don&#39;t spend it on the other hand on co2 outputs like gas.</p>\n\n<p>You need to implement it on import and export. WTO already approved it as a fair tax (hence no trade war sueings). Why is this important? Well because this is the part where everything comes together, now a national regulation exhibits if effects on a global level.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously you could produce steel in China without paying the tax for co2 there.

Not so fun story today, I almost blew up my trading stack. Never felt so irresponsible before, I'm honestly amazed I got out unscathed.

Had only a vauge setup, improper risk management (kept adjusting SL), crazy position size, all for a quick buck.

I don't have the time, experience or knowledge to pull it off.

Extremely high risk - at some point, when you believe the market is nearing the top, you attempt to move all of your ETH into say, a stable coin, before buying back in (with your full stack) when the market corrects to what you believe will be around it's lowest point. I know most folks would get rekt trying to do this but in theory, you could increase your bag substantially IF you timed it right. So for arguments sake, I am including it as an option.\n2. Medium risk - you have a small % of your stack that you try to do 1) with and a larger % that is being held no matter what, unless of course some fundamental thing changes with the tech that goes against what you believe in.\n3. Low risk - you set targets to take profits out all the way up to what you believe will be the market top and vice versa on the way down to buy back in and increase your bag with profits made. I mean, this is just the DCA concept and seems to be widely accepted as the safest way to operate.\n4. Lowest risk - you simply hold everything you have and only DCA to add more, never selling any in the short to medium term. I get that some people would say never taking profits is actually high risk, but with the objective being to increase your Ether bag, this is the only way I can see that you are guaranteed to increase your holdings using only the market. Of course, the value of the bag could go down but again to point 2), until something changes with the tech that goes against your values, I don't get too worried about monetary value.\n\nOf course, anything in crypto deemed low risk can be taken with a large big pinch of salt. I just needed to give some kind of naming convention to this for clarity. Feel free to shoot holes in the logic, I'm here to learn and I'm genuinely interested in how people approach this topic.\n\nI know there are variables to consider like personal goals and also other ways to increase your bag such as staking but don't want to overcomplicate things - although, if you have anything to add there then shoot! :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So folks, as someone who is pretty new in terms of actually putting my money where my mouth is and investing in crypto, what would you recommend when it comes to trying to &#39;time the market&#39; to increase your bag?

A lot of the fun in gaming NFTs is in their trading aspect and that becomes impossible if you have to pay gas fees equal, higher or slightly lower than the profit you're obtaining by selling, say, a GU card. This obviously opened the door to things like Flow, that doesn't benefit from the decentralization aspect of Ethereum, but does the job of providing a decent platform for trading to anyone who wants to.

Not yet ready as far as I know, but given the uptick in Twitter chatter around it lately, it might be in the final stages of testing.   \n\n\nGiven that Ethereum possesses the tooling and the network effects that will, in my opinion, augment and expand what NFTs are capable of (from NFT derivatives, to NFT indexes, to more NFT composability across games, to something else we can't yet fully visualize being a thing), a fast and cheap solution to trade those would definitely bring billions into ETH, if and when that solution becomes ready, available and implemented across marketplaces. I have absolutely no idea what's the estimate on that.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, from a trader's perspective, gaming NFTs might prove to be a decent defense against bear markets, but I'll leave this for anyone reading to think about how.  \n\n\nTill that sort of fast and cheap mechanism is out, other networks that provide less decentralization, more throughput and lower costs (like a centralized database) will benefit from the hype. My personal hope, as an ETH holder, is that they do not acquire composable effects nor network effects during this first big NFT cycle and that Immutable or some other delivers what they've promised asap.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been involved in the NFT space for some time now, but mostly focused on NFTs that present some utility / competitive components (such as gaming NFTs, in my case, Gods Unchained and Sorare) than art NFTs.

Not yet ready as far as I know, but given the uptick in Twitter chatter around it lately, it might be in the final stages of testing.   </p>\n\n<p>Given that Ethereum possesses the tooling and the network effects that will, in my opinion, augment and expand what NFTs are capable of (from NFT derivatives, to NFT indexes, to more NFT composability across games, to something else we can&#39;t yet fully visualize being a thing), a fast and cheap solution to trade those would definitely bring billions into ETH, if and when that solution becomes ready, available and implemented across marketplaces. I have absolutely no idea what&#39;s the estimate on that.  </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, from a trader&#39;s perspective, gaming NFTs might prove to be a decent defense against bear markets, but I&#39;ll leave this for anyone reading to think about how.  </p>\n\n<p>Till that sort of fast and cheap mechanism is out, other networks that provide less decentralization, more throughput and lower costs (like a centralized database) will benefit from the hype. My personal hope, as an ETH holder, is that they do not acquire composable effects nor network effects during this first big NFT cycle and that Immutable or some other delivers what they&#39;ve promised asap.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-08 09:49:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gq8fvvp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m098lz","parent_id":"t1_gq7zh28","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Have you checked out aavegotchi?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Have you checked out aavegotchi?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-08 12:15:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gq90anc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m098lz","parent_id":"t1_gq8fvvp","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ruvalm","body":"I've had a look, but I either missed the point of it or I didn't really see how / where the gaming component of it is.
