Decentralized - validators are spread out all over the world rather than concentrated in one place\n\n4. A public good for the community, not controlled by a business or investors\n\n5. Offers tooling that encourages node operators to use any of the four staking clients.\n\nThere is currently one project that meets all of these criteria, they're slated to launch in early April - Rocket Pool.
