The change being:\n\n>Changes the block reward paid to proof-of-work (POW) miners to 3 ETH from existing 2 ETH, but kicks off a 0.25 quarterly drop to a final 1.0 ETH Reward 2 Years Later. \n\nAlso, Flexpool (and others) are trying to champion [EIP-969](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-969.md) (Essentially ASIC resistance, but not ProgPoW). A thread on r/EtherMining has appeared discussing it - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/m39jep/calling_on_miner_community_to_contribute_to/) \\- made by someone else, not Flexpool.\n\nProbably most interesting in all this is that between EIP-3333's 2 year reduction of BR, the EIP-969 OP on r/EtherMining thinking that \"[PoS is 2 to 3 years away](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/m39jep/calling_on_miner_community_to_contribute_to/gqnowzh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\" (If not more??), and just general miner sentiment on the discord being that PoS is a long ways off I'm just surprised to see such disconnect on what is going on within this subsection of the mining community. Even before yesterdays GitHub update with the merge specs did anyone realistically think the merge was more then 12 months out...?\n\nI believe the goal of EIP-3333 / EIP-969 being updated is for it to be brought to one of the upcoming dev calls.  It's probably too late anyway, but devs have consistently noted that some type of of formal EIP needs to be put forward if miners want **any** chance of core dev support. So I guess +1 for trying?

Instead, think of it abstractly, such as what events need to transpire for that ratio gain to occur.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m thinking once the migration has occurred, and all of DeFi has successfully transitioned to 2.0 and is demonstrating just how awesome the tps/fees/scalability are, mad ratio gains will be had. It will probably be slowly priced in up until that point, with occasional ratio gains and dips along the way, as we still are tightly correlated with btc.</p>\n\n<p>DeFi was around in the 2018 bear but it took 2+ years of solid developments and growth before it got to the point we are at now. I would apply a similar time frame to our current situation, but maybe a bit faster now that all gears are in motion, we are in a bull run, and the devs are mentioning that 2.0 could be sooner than we thought.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-12 09:24:26","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-12 09:28:04","id":"gqpkz4k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m3ba0d","parent_id":"t1_gqpjumj","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/DangerIsMyUsername","body":">Fundamentals and ratio recovery won't happen until ETH absolutely outshines BTC by 10x in every way\n\nYes, exactly.
