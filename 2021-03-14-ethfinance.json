As a result, I came up with a stablecoin (lets call it Fai) idea of my own for Ethereum that I think is really cool and want to bounce it off of someone smarter than me  to see if it really could have merit.\n\nSo the idea is combining the mechanics of the Terra blockchain stablecoin mint and burn mechanics  with the PCV (Protocol Controlled Value) idea of Fei and adding an additional Promise system.\n\nIt would work as follows:\n\n1. The main contract would always enable minting 1 Fai for 1 USD Eth equivalent (that eth goes into the protocol reserve (PCV) meaning it is owned by the protocol and individuals would have no claim over it) and burn 1 Fai to get  1 USD Eth equivalent from the protocol reserves (PCV) at any time. There would be no Dai-like CDP-s, just minting and burning the currency.\n2. The PCV would act as the first and main reserve and collateral for Fai. The main contract would guarantee the peg of the stablecoin, but as a downside would introduce a risk of undercollateralization in  the event of Eth plummeting and of  a bank-run like event collapsing the currency.\n3. At all times, most of the PCV would be put to work in Defi (AMM-s or Yearn or similar), enabling yield generation for the protocol. The liquidity would be pulled from Defi in the event of raised burning demand.\n4. So, the PCV would act as a fractional reserve for Fai. To raise confidence in the currency, however, a \"Promise\" contract is added to the protocol.\n5. The promise contract would in its essence be a promise by ETH hodlers to bail out Fai in the event of a bank run and make it fully collateralized when needed. Technically, it would just mean sending your ETH into a contract, that in the event of PCV failing as a reserve, would send your ETH into the Fai protocol and use it as a collateral.\n6. The promise contract would bring the ultimate capital efficiency, as the \"promised\" ETH does not have to be locked and can be freely used in Defi protocols, with the promise contract acting  as a sort of middleware contract when entering Defi (You send your eth to the Promise contract and it sends it to your preferred Defi contract). It could for example be incorporated as an option into leading lending protocols like Aave and Compound as a way to get low risk extra APY.\n7. In exchange for the promise, the yield generated by the PCV of Fai protocol would be distributed to the hodlers of ETH in the promise contract.\n8. The game theoretic implications of the promise contract would probably in practice mean, that people's trust in the system is high and massive burn events never happen. The ETH in the promise contract is never used making the contract lucrative as a relatively low risk and high return investment. Why not secure the de facto decentralized stablecoin of Ethereum as a long term holder? As the contract ETH amount would probably be capped, I imagine the demand to get in would be massive if the coin indeed would get recognition.\n\nIMO this system would greatly improve capital efficiency (enable close to 1:1 efficiency) compared to DAI and would eliminate all need for messing with the stablecoins in people's wallets (rebases and stuff) to keep the peg.\n\nI am not very familiar with all the stablecoin attempts from 2020. I guess the biggest novelty in my system is the \"promising\" part.

It is a really neat idea from a user pov (take a loan and it slowly pays itself off), but there is the risk there if the other protocols fail you lose the collateral and the peg collapses.

I just hope the feelings are based on objective measures of security and not just because miners proposed it. I'm not even really accusing you of that, but I think it's happening in the broad sense. That is sort of what I was hinting at above --- when the devs felt it was okay to increase issuance with the PoS chain generally nobody cared. Miners want to do it --- it's a problem. Miners of course directly benefit (where as the ACD still have to run validators) so its a little more unsavory, but it's still true.\n\nWhich sort of transitions into your second paragraph. It's a conversation that sort of mirrors the ACD call discussing removing 2315 - is it dangerous to set a precedent like that? That I think is what everyone's fear is since Ethereum has 'never' (in their eyes) increased issuance. But it sort of falls flat considering we already did increase issuance with the PoS chain. That precedent has already been set that we will raise issuance. Can we not in sort of a devil's advocate way claim that the ACDs 'blackmailed' us into accepting that issuance increase? The 'threat' being if we don't accept the beacon chain model they won't work on pushing forward PoS anymore? It's sort of cheeky because the devs motivations are more inline with the overall health and goals of the Ethereum network then miners, but fundamentally that concept is a fundamental truth. They didn't seem to have any interest in lowering the PoW block rewards to offset the printed out of thin air PoS rewards.

I just hope the feelings are based on objective measures of security and not just because miners proposed it. I&#39;m not even really accusing you of that, but I think it&#39;s happening in the broad sense. That is sort of what I was hinting at above --- when the devs felt it was okay to increase issuance with the PoS chain generally nobody cared. Miners want to do it --- it&#39;s a problem. Miners of course directly benefit (where as the ACD still have to run validators) so its a little more unsavory, but it&#39;s still true.</p>\n\n<p>Which sort of transitions into your second paragraph. It&#39;s a conversation that sort of mirrors the ACD call discussing removing 2315 - is it dangerous to set a precedent like that? That I think is what everyone&#39;s fear is since Ethereum has &#39;never&#39; (in their eyes) increased issuance. But it sort of falls flat considering we already did increase issuance with the PoS chain. That precedent has already been set that we will raise issuance. Can we not in sort of a devil&#39;s advocate way claim that the ACDs &#39;blackmailed&#39; us into accepting that issuance increase? The &#39;threat&#39; being if we don&#39;t accept the beacon chain model they won&#39;t work on pushing forward PoS anymore? It&#39;s sort of cheeky because the devs motivations are more inline with the overall health and goals of the Ethereum network then miners, but fundamentally that concept is a fundamental truth. They didn&#39;t seem to have any interest in lowering the PoW block rewards to offset the printed out of thin air PoS rewards. Maybe I&#39;ll ask that on the next ETH 2.0 AMA...</p>\n\n<p>And your final point is true and I would agree - if EIP-1559 can&#39;t pass because a subset of miners can get motivated enough to take down the chain, Ethereum (or at least its governance model) will have failed.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I&#39;ll add, that thanks for the convo.

We&#39;re still so so early!)</p>\n\n<p>Non-fungible tokens are a paradigm shift, in similar ways that Bitcoin was. And art is just <strong>a single</strong> application of NFTs. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks, Ethereum.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-14 15:28:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gqybhm9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m4pc9i","parent_id":"t3_m4pc9i","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/im_THIS_guy","body":"The title is meant to be click bait.
