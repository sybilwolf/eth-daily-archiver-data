In my personal opinion, this is bullshit. It doesn't fucking matter. We're all here for 60-80 years on this floating ball of rock in space and we could be wiped out by any moment by a gamma ray burst, meteor or someone turning off the simulation we may or may not live in. Who the fuck cares if you were a top notch laywer or the best quarterback in your state? To me, only two things matter in this world as they are the only things which have any true value when you really zoom out. In order, these are:\n\n1. Your happiness.\n\n2. The happiness of those around you.\n\nThat's all. Nothing else matters as nobody will remember you 100 years from now and anyone who does know you for the next 100 years because you were an astronaut or president or something is also inconsequential because 100 years is just a blip in the cosmic timeline and when everyone else inevitably passes on you'll still be forgotten.\n\nNow you may get satisfaction from being an important person and influencing others for the better, and if so then that's great! Shoot for the moon! But if not, then don't feel like you have to do that to be happy. Enjoy your narrow slice of time and space while you have it and help those around you to enjoy it too, whether you do that by being a world famous astronaut who inspires millions or simply by being a nice friend or helping out your fellow astronauts in r/EthFinance. The only really tangible thing is how you feel right here, right now and in the future, so don't let a lack of accolades to show off get you down. I see more happiness on the faces of poor people in 3rd world countries who have to live in the moment than some of the most successful people in the world. Too many people just dedicate their lives to getting to the top only to find out that the top isn't all it's cracked up to be. So I say forget the race to the top and start focusing on the journey to happiness. How can you be a failure if you enjoy yourself and help others have a good time too?\n\nI know this is all subjective but all I'm trying to say is don't beat yourself up about not being the sharpest tool in the shed. Clearly your family like to succeed in a certain way/field but who said every tool in the shed needs to be sharp? I can't imagine a sharp hammer being very useful. I think everyone should do their own thing and not worry about what others think about them.\n\nHopefully your bet on ETH will pay off and help you get where you want to be. :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I can never really take any comfort in the things I\u2019m good at, because it haunts me that I cheated my way through a third of my degree; it haunts me that my father has an engineering degree, that my uncle is an executive VP at ISO, that my grandfather was a civil engineer who built his own firm from the ground up.</p>\n\n<p>I write, and I make music and perform, and I have my day (night) desk job that pays the bills.

If I ask you to give me a low ETH price that has a 90% chance of hitting in the next month, you\u2019ll probably give me the same number, because on those time scales the answer is \u201cwho knows\u201d, either the price trends up and never hits it, or the price trends down and you wasted money.  The only way to keep the probability above 50% is to keep it sufficiently close to the current price that random variation can hit it before the mean moves.

In interviews he is quite self-deprecating and says that when it comes to philanthropy, it turned out that his talents were better suited to donating rather than being a public-facing figure for promoting Effective Altruism.
