I'm certainly not bearish on RPL or the project and bought a chunk back in [December](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kg2ggl/daily_general_discussion_december_19_2020/ggebbfu/) so this isn't the whining of someone who missed the rocket. What I'd mostly like to address is this claim that the 10% insurance minimum is going to \"guarantee\" a minimum RPL/ETH ratio of something like 0.035 that makes buying it right now a slam dunk. I'm not saying the price won't go up a lot as we approach launch. I'd just like to focus on the particular claim regarding the price floor.\n\nLet's start with this. [What is the 10% insurance minimum?](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd)\n\n>When depositing ETH, node operators must also deposit a minimum amount of RPL to act as collateral in the case they incur any of these penalties. Should a penalty occur and the user finishes staking with < 16 ETH, the collateral is sold for ETH at auction and the proceeds from this sale are given back to the protocol to compensate for the missing ETH.\n>\n>When a node operator provides an amount of RPL as collateral as an insurance promise, they are rewarded with RPL rewards respective to the amount of collateral they provide. The minimum collateral required is currently 10% of the ETH value and capped at a maximum of 150%.\n\nBasically when a node operator decides to join the network they need to stake 10% of the USD value of their ETH in the protocol so that if more than their 16 ETH is slashed their stake is burned before rETH holders bear the brunt of a bad validator. So, what happens if the value of RPL falls after they start their node? I can't find a definitive answer but there are a few options:\n\n1) They can use node operator rewards from underwater nodes to buy back and burn RPL until those nodes post more RPL themselves.\n\n2) They can buy RPL and give it to the node operators whose bond is below the minimum. (kinder but more gas).\n\nEither way it is likely that node operators will *lose profit* if the 10% minimum is not maintained. If the RPL value falls below the minimum then node operator profit will probably be used to shore up the RPL price. I accept this as criteria for a price floor in that any ratio below that floor incentivizes node operators to sell their ETH (which they have bags of) for RPL. Staking while not maintaining the minimum should be *rationally suboptimal*. So what is the price floor?\n\n1) It's an RPL/ETH ratio.\n\n2) It depends on the adoption metrics of Rocketpool, obviously.\n\nA pessimistic price floor assumes that the protocol fee you get from staking RPL in excess of the 10% minimum is much less valuable than just owning and staking more ETH. For instance if the protocol fee was 0 then why would node operators bond 20% of their ETH TVL instead of 10%? At that fee rate I would expect node operators to only be in it for the node operator fees compared to solo staking. Let's inject some numbers.\n\nOne claim I saw was a few days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/m3pug8/the_rocket_pool_investment_thesis/). Using his numbers, if there is 15M ETH staked and VS%=20% then that implies 3 Million ETH staked in RPL. Half of that is collateralized by insurance on the node operator end so the total supply of 1.5 Million ETH needs to be backed by 10% of RPL in value. Current ETH price is around $1800 this would set a price floor at 270M value bonded (1800 *price per eth* \\*1.5M *insured ETH staked* \\* .1 *minimum insurance*). Turns out that RPL total market cap is around $270M so RPL is fairly priced if those adoption metrics hit. Again, the fair price should always be an RPL/ETH ratio, so if this is a fair price then an ETH ratio of 0.0093 is a fair ratio. Scale down your floor accordingly using your adoption statistics.\n\nCompare how different that estimate is to the investment thesis minimum ratio of: 0.035. We disagree by over 350%\n\nThe next argument(s) usually go like this:\n\n1) RPL will exist in AMM's, not 100% of it will be staked\n\nTrue, but what's the *floor* on that? That's all I'm focused on for this post. The only objective answer is some number approaching 100% of RPL being used to collateralize. Anything else is more speculation on top of the adoption statistics that I'm already granting for the sake of argument.\n\n2) RPL will be used as a governance asset.\n\nYes, and? Is there a revenue stream attached to voting? AFAIK the revenue stream of RPL for its calculation as a capital asset purely comes from the flat protocol fee being given to stakers.\n\n3) More than 10% will be staked.\n\nThis is where I refer you to my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gsnaoo/daily_general_discussion_may_29_2020/fs9p3uz/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kg2ggl/daily_general_discussion_december_19_2020/ggebbfu/) that argue the \"fair value\" PE of Rocketpool should be calculated based on the value of staking RPL in excess of the minimum, not the node operator flexible fee, total ETH generated by the protocol, or some other metric like TVL. If node operators in aggregate are staking anywhere approaching the 10% minimum then the protocol fee ought to be adjusted. The profit from staking more RPL should be approximately equal to the profit of just staking more ETH.

In the past I have called people out for it and said just pay your part and fund public goods. Vitalik would approve. However, I also resent much of the tax system due to its inefficiency and at least here in New Zealand, bullshit tax laws specific to crypto. I&#39;d much rather send my tax money to a charity or Gitcoin Grants rather than fund the incredibly inefficient bureaucracy of government bodies I have to deal with every day at my work place that hamper the innovation the company I work for produces. I will still pay my taxes but I will be vocal to the tax authorities about how bass ackward their crypto tax laws are here.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-16 13:08:44","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-16 13:12:32","id":"gr5sp1v","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m62bc8","parent_id":"t1_gr4bsdq","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Canadiens1993","body":"Just listened to the recent \"The Pomp\" podcast.
