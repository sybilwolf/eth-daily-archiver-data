I'm not going to discuss whether either of those targets are correct, but let's just assume that's what it ends up being and work backwards.\n\nMany people seem to think that if it's supposed to be $10k on Sep 30 and was $2k on Feb 19, the growth should be logarithmic between those.  So we should be at $2.7k Apr 1, $3.3k May 1, $4.2k June 1, etc., which would mean we're currently falling behind and have a long way to go to catch back up.\n\nThat's not how it works though, crypto bull runs are *always* heavily biased toward the final few weeks.  BTC in 2011 grew 3.4x in the 8 days before the peak.  BTC in 2013 grew 5x in the 25 days before the peak.  BTC in 2017 grew 2.4x in the 22 days before the peak.  ETH in 2018 grew 2.7x in the 33 days before the peak.  And it's very important to keep in mind that in these dates and values I'm providing, the *starting* point for all of those growths was the current ATH at that time.  So I'm not just cherry-picking the bottom of some big dip right before the peak, that's literally the ATH growing that fast.\n\nSo what does that mean?  If you take this pretend end point of $10k on Sep 30 and work backwards, that means there's a very good chance our ATH on Sep 1 will be in the $3000s.  In order to hit $10k this cycle we don't need to be growing at a constant clip of 25% per month, we only need to be growing at more like 10% per month, and taking a month or two or three off for a correction really doesn't matter, we can make that back up in a day.\n\nSo just be patient, and if we're still sitting at $2.5k in June or $3k in September, that doesn't mean the bull run is dead or that $10k or hell even $20k are off the table.  In fact, we'd be right on schedule.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think it&#39;s important to remind a few of the new people here about the <em>shape</em> of crypto bull runs.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people are calling for a $10k top, and a lot of people are estimating the end of the bull around the fall, call it September 30.

So far all the other chains are saying \"we can do ethereum things too\", I want to see what *only they can do*. If you just do the same thing i can do in a rollup then it isnt worth it, and the liquidity is already over here. They need to show a use case that i cant do on ethereum, bring some novelty to it.\n\nOn top of that I think too many people miss the fact that ethereum is fun, there is a community that draws silly pictures, makes a billion dollar company around unicorn imagery, is actually being used to its current capacity because demand for it is so high. It celebrates individuals and reminds me of early internet homepages. Dot (and other chains) feel like brand management / corporate design. They need some life flowing into them. \n\nI think they have a place in the future, but so far it looks like they are going to be bridging to ethereum, more than ethereum will need a bridge to them.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>yeah, the polkadot dev community is small, but there is less noise which can be a good thing. But my feeling with it is that its not quite amazing enough to win me over into having to learn a bunch more dev stuff (compared with L2 deployment being fairly painless). </p>\n\n<p>It is far more worthy of its position to me than avax/bnb/ada though. It feels like people are actually getting on with working on dot (same with cosmos), rather than just pumping vc bags. </p>\n\n<p>I think dot has as much to prove, and less momentum, and less devs. Its the same with all the competitor chains, we dont know their boundaries yet. \nSo its a race of rollups vs competitor chains all trying to outcompete each other.
