Of course, as we all know BTC wins this time frame but it was interesting to see what happened with the other coins.\n\nOf the top 200 cryptocurrencies 3 years ago, **only 63** are still in the top 200 today.\n\nOf those 63, only **12** moved up/sideways in the rankings --- BTC stayed #1 and ETH stayed #2. ADA stayed at #5. BNB(23 to 3) / USDT (32 to 4) / LINK (96 to 10) / DOGE (35 to 15) DCR (53 to 45) / ENJ (120 to 51) / MANA (160 to 57) / BNT (105 to 67) / ZEN (156 to 97).\n\nETH was one of **13** that actually had a price increase over this time period. The biggest winner --- >!LINK.!< It went up 2750% in that timeframe. Followed (in order) by BNB (1173%), ENJ, MANA, DOGE, BTC (330%), DCR, ETH (35%), ADA (32%), DNT, BAT, ANT, & ZEN (0.17%, WOO!)\n\nActual Marketcap going up? 19 of them. ETH about 2/3rds of the way down (at 61%) but still that's a small group. >!LINK!< won again if curious, USDT then BNB. BTC up 378% and ADA just barely edged us out at a 63% increase.\n\nSo, I think I'll repeat something I was talking about yesterday. \"The Tech\" is recognized in this space on the longer time frames. nearly 95% of all the top 200 coins at the peak bull of 2018 have since lost value. And about 2/3rds of them lost enough value to warrant being kicked out of the Top 200 at this point. BTC, ETH and DCR (what am I missing with this coin??) were the only 3 coins to show up as gains on both this list and my previous post yesterday.\n\nReality is this on any long term time frame - we are talking about a space that has 6,506 coins listed on Coingecko right now. If you picked ETH you basically grabbed one of the maybe dozen coins over the last 5 years that actually performed at any meaningful level. BTC is *worth* comparing to, but it isn't the *only thing* worth comparing too. And once you do that you will see ETH did pretty well.\n\nData - [1.14.2018](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20180114/) / [3.14.2021](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20210314/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I was have been motivated again by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/m8anmd/daily_general_discussion_march_19_2021/grh9ldf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">this post</a> by <a href=\"/u/pegcity\">u/pegcity</a> to look at the top 200 from the point where ETH was the highest on the historical page of CMC. <strong>January 14th, 2018 @ $1,366.77.</strong> (Peg also mentioned &#39;since ETH broke $400&#39; so maybe I&#39;ll do that too...) Of course, as we all know BTC wins this time frame but it was interesting to see what happened with the other coins.</p>\n\n<p>Of the top 200 cryptocurrencies 3 years ago, <strong>only 63</strong> are still in the top 200 today.</p>\n\n<p>Of those 63, only <strong>12</strong> moved up/sideways in the rankings --- BTC stayed #1 and ETH stayed #2. ADA stayed at #5. BNB(23 to 3) / USDT (32 to 4) / LINK (96 to 10) / DOGE (35 to 15) DCR (53 to 45) / ENJ (120 to 51) / MANA (160 to 57) / BNT (105 to 67) / ZEN (156 to 97).</p>\n\n<p>ETH was one of <strong>13</strong> that actually had a price increase over this time period. The biggest winner --- <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">LINK.</span> It went up 2750% in that timeframe. Followed (in order) by BNB (1173%), ENJ, MANA, DOGE, BTC (330%), DCR, ETH (35%), ADA (32%), DNT, BAT, ANT, &amp; ZEN (0.17%, WOO!)</p>\n\n<p>Actual Marketcap going up? 19 of them. ETH about 2/3rds of the way down (at 61%) but still that&#39;s a small group. <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">LINK</span> won again if curious, USDT then BNB. BTC up 378% and ADA just barely edged us out at a 63% increase.</p>\n\n<p>So, I think I&#39;ll repeat something I was talking about yesterday. &quot;The Tech&quot; is recognized in this space on the longer time frames. nearly 95% of all the top 200 coins at the peak bull of 2018 have since lost value. And about 2/3rds of them lost enough value to warrant being kicked out of the Top 200 at this point. BTC, ETH and DCR (what am I missing with this coin??) were the only 3 coins to show up as gains on both this list and my previous post yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>Reality is this on any long term time frame - we are talking about a space that has 6,506 coins listed on Coingecko right now.

I tend to believe gas should be more related to $, but as eth price rise people with eth would also be richer and thus care less about $ price of gas. Also, with eth price increasing, the chain is usually more congested leading to higher gas. And, with the exception of stable coins, most other tokens on Ethereum have appreciated in value too.</p>\n\n<p>So gas is not 100% linearly related to eth price, but there certainly is a relation.
