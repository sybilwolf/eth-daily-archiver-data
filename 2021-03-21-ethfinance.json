We\u2019ve had some movement on the timing of the merge and an Optimism \u2018delay\u2019, if you can call it that, but I think us interested ecosystem observers are all just playing a big waiting game right now.\n\n**Timeline impacts this week:**\n\n~ Lots of positive talk on this week\u2019s [All Core Devs call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AclPXsRlgSc) about the eth1/eth2 merge. It looks like consensus is forming around delivering the minimum viable merge in Shanghai, the upgrade/hard fork after London, London being the upgrade into which EIP-1559 and the ice age delay will both go. An October date had previously been mooted for Shanghai, but this was prior to the notion that it might include the merge. **IF the merge is included, Shanghai will likely be pushed back due to the sheer amount of testing that will be required, but in Danny Ryan\u2019s view (among others) the ambition is still to deliver the merge in 2021.** Exciting times. The next ACD call will be focussing on this topic, and progressing towards finalising the scope for London. Additionally, for those looking to dig into some of the likely technical requirements for staking in the lead-up to and post-merge, EthStaker hosted a [community call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL8l7GGCpw0) this week on these topics. Well worth the watch as per usual from the Ethstaker team.\n\n~ Off the back of merge developments, I have added the **subsequent Ethereum protocol upgrade/hard fork to the timeline**. This upgrade should include validator withdrawals, which is functionality that is being removed from the initial merge MVP in order to deliver the merge more quickly. The estimate is 3-4 months post-merge, so I\u2019m going for Q1 2022 on this one.\n\n~ **The planned upcoming protocol upgrades (Berlin, London, and Altair) are all still on track as per previous timelines. Berlin should be up on Rinkby this week (24th) which is the final stage of testing ahead of mainnet release on 14th April.**\n\n~ The Rocketpool final beta went live this week as planned. For those who would like to participate either by running a RPL node or by staking fake ETH, head on over to the [Rocketpool beta website](https://beta.rocketpool.net). **Rocketpool is still on track to go live next month.**\n\n~ In layer 2 land, many observers, myself included, had tentatively pencilled in 15th March as the date for the release of Optimism\u2019s optimistic rollups solution on mainnet. Well\u2026 clearly the 15th has come and gone and we do not yet have mainnet Optimism. Many have correctly pointed out that the 15th was not necessarily set in stone, so we may have been getting ahead of ourselves there. Nevertheless, there has been some interesting chat on discord and twitter about this \u2018delay\u2019 and it seems as if there is a dependency on third parties aligning with the Optimism launch. They\u2019re not ready yet! Most are assuming that this group includes Uniswap and [Hayden Adams](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1372951409625346055) seems to be hinting at the same. I think we are ALL looking forward to this becoming clear because something something about gas fees. All told, this is vital - a ton of the upcoming activity depends on this Optimism launch.\n\n\u2014\n\n**THE TIMELINE**\n\nAll dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.

Instead, they marketed themselves as a \u201csufficient L1 base layer chain\u201d that competes with Ethereum. EOS, BSC and Tron are popular examples of that, and it\u2019s not only misleading, it\u2019s just a waste of time IMO (companies/governments/people will not want valuable tokens or dapps built on top of a base security layer that is subject to \u201ceasy\u201d collusion/bribery/attacks\u2014they might as well be using a centralized server and stick to the way things are currently done rather than go through the hassle of doing it on a \u201cblockchain.\u201d). This is also why, even though Tron or xDAI or other sidechains existed since 2017-9, the top DeFi dapps didn\u2019t deploy and build on them. This was also the reason Reddit didn\u2019t choose xDAI for its Reddit Scaling Competition, and why it will very likely launch on Optimism or Starkware.\n\nOther popular sub-categories of L2s besides sidechains can include techniques like what Arbitrum/Optimism/Loopring/etc. are using (rollups\u2014though there are different types). Like sidechains, many aim to gain speed/throughput through some sort of trade off (compared to L1), but the key difference is that the tradeoff comes in data availability/computation rather than the # of nodes that will verify transactions (though all L2s, whether it\u2019s a side chain or a rollup will have *some* sort of increased attack vector vs. the base L1 layer). A big difference here is that, instead of creating their own base layer security, rollups leverage Ethereum\u2019s L1 security guarantees (the scaling gains are instead made by batching or compressing parts of the transaction data or computation, which then gets published to the L1 layer). This results in a *much* more dependable way of increasing throughput from a security standpoint vs. sidechains.\n\nVitalik has written extensively over the years about L2s and rollups. Here are some good posts:\n\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html\n\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2019/08/28/hybrid_layer_2.html\n\nTLDR: the main difference between sidechains and other L2 scaling techniques is where its security is derived from.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Excellent question.

This was also the reason Reddit didn\u2019t choose xDAI for its Reddit Scaling Competition, and why it will very likely launch on Optimism or Starkware.</p>\n\n<p>Other popular sub-categories of L2s besides sidechains can include techniques like what Arbitrum/Optimism/Loopring/etc. are using (rollups\u2014though there are different types). Like sidechains, many aim to gain speed/throughput through some sort of trade off (compared to L1), but the key difference is that the tradeoff comes in data availability/computation rather than the # of nodes that will verify transactions (though all L2s, whether it\u2019s a side chain or a rollup will have <em>some</em> sort of increased attack vector vs. the base L1 layer). A big difference here is that, instead of creating their own base layer security, rollups leverage Ethereum\u2019s L1 security guarantees (the scaling gains are instead made by batching or compressing parts of the transaction data or computation, which then gets published to the L1 layer). This results in a <em>much</em> more dependable way of increasing throughput from a security standpoint vs. sidechains.</p>\n\n<p>Vitalik has written extensively over the years about L2s and rollups. Here are some good posts:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html\">https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/08/28/hybrid_layer_2.html\">https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/08/28/hybrid_layer_2.html</a></p>\n\n<p>TLDR: the main difference between sidechains and other L2 scaling techniques is where its security is derived from.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-21 18:27:08","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-21 19:24:19","id":"grrjd5s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m9ptnz","parent_id":"t1_grrhipi","score":57,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Dude.

My college finance professors would be shitting their pants if you told them instead of risking your money in this bloated stock market for 7% annual returns, you could get the same ROI in literal cash, 0-downside investments.\n\nAre transaction fees currently too high?  Yes.  Is 10% a reasonable rate of return for a cash investment for 10 years?

Rollups will still have enough TPS to hold us over until then. 1000 TPS on optimistic rollups is a scalability increase of almost 100x.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we can get exchanges supporting optimism that will make on boarding easier but I still think we are going to see an awful lot of activity between layer 1 and layer 2, particularly at first. This is why I&#39;m keen that layer 1 is capable of handling the load or we end up with a really big 15 lane motorway with a tiny 1 lane on ramp.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty right now among people who aren&#39;t deep into how rollups work. When we see Optimism release and dapps migrate, all that doubt will fade and nobody will care about execution sharding anymore. In any case, sharding at the base layer isn&#39;t coming until 2022 at the earliest, but the consensus is that it simply isn&#39;t needed because of how awesome rollups are.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-21 06:09:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"grp4aj6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m9ptnz","parent_id":"t1_grp3z1a","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Coldsnap","body":"I think that uncertainty is the #1 thing holding the price back at the moment vs BTC.
