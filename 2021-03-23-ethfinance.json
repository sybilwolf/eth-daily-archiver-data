And I think sometimes people get stuck in a \"I'd rather it work and be delayed then it launch broken\" mentality. Which I feel like it all doesn't really apply here because the issue isn't a delay due to a bug... its a 1 month delay of a testnet due to poor communication.

It won't fail, but there are a lot of pitfalls over the next 3 to 6 months that can chip away from it's sheer domination of the marketplace.

Just need to make sure to take out that liquidity as soon as it reaches your price otherwise if prices goes down it will be traded back to your original asset.  I&#39;m sure other apps will built on that and automate the process of pulling out the liquidity as soon as it reaches your range. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>V3\u2019s LP customizability opens up a novel order feature to complement market orders, which we are calling \u2019range orders\u2019.  </p>\n\n<p>LPs can deposit a single token in a custom price range above or below the current price: if the market price enters into their specified range, they sell one asset for another along a smooth curve while earning swap fees in the process.  </p>\n\n<p>Depositing to a narrow range feels similar to a traditional limit order. For example, if the current price of DAI is below 1.001 USDC, Alice could add $10m worth of DAI to the range of 1.001 \u2014 1.002 DAI/USDC.  </p>\n\n<p>Once DAI trades above 1.002 DAI/USDC, Alice\u2019s liquidity will have fully converted into USDC. Alice must withdraw her liquidity (or use a third-party service to withdraw on her behalf) to avoid automatically converting back into DAI if DAI/USDC starts trading below 1.002.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-23 11:08:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gryezcu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mb80at","parent_id":"t1_gryc3yj","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"You could use matcha for limit orders","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You could use matcha for limit orders</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-23 11:05:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gryekaa","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mb80at","parent_id":"t1_gryc3yj","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Xitir","body":"Haven't heard of matcha before, but it seems interesting.

Every other human being is also dealing with the shit in their own lives, and it can be exhausting having other people who constantly complain or are over-dramatic piled on top of that.</p>\n\n<p>While it is important to &#39;just be yourself,&#39; it&#39;s also important to realize that being yourself includes negative traits that each of us -- as individuals -- need to constantly work on improving.  I know I have plenty of them myself and it&#39;s a daily struggle. That said, there&#39;s no one else who can improve you except for you.  Even if Ethereum moons beyond your wildest dreams, the money isn&#39;t going to suddenly get you a bunch of friends, or dates, or whatever it is that you&#39;re missing in your life.  You can&#39;t be reliant on others to make your life better, you need to take action and do it yourself.  Yes, it is scary, and you will have failures along the way.  But that&#39;s just fucking life, and you pick yourself up and try until you get it right, or stay trapped in a miserable existence.  </p>\n\n<p>The choice is yours.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-23 21:29:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gs0j6ni","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mb80at","parent_id":"t1_grzgadk","score":-1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/suicidaleggroll","body":"If your previous post that you YOLOd your entire checking and savings accounts into ETH is actually true, that's your problem.
