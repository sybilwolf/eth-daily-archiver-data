They *might* release a simplified smart contract platform before 2023, though.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, it&#39;s nigh impossible to attain feature parity with the EVM, which is why almost all post-2018 smart contract platform is simply cloning EVM in some form - BS Chain, Polkadot, Avalanche, NEAR (and obviously all Ethereum sidechains) etc. etc. There simply no shortcut to leapfrogging 6 years of intense development and battle-hardening. Indeed, Ethereum itself has shelved plans for Ewasm - EVM is here to stay and will likely continue evolving and improving over time.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that Cardano is a pre-2018 smart contract platform from the days of EOS, Tron and Neo when hubris drove people to believe they could build something better - all of them failed miserably. Of course, the greatest trick that Cardano pulled was to fail shipping a product at all unlike its competitors from that era.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-24 08:43:13","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-24 10:40:58","id":"gs263gw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mbysn2","parent_id":"t1_gs1xxup","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SwagtimusPrime","body":"Yeah, you're right.

Maybe -80%, maybe -85%, maybe -90%, but yes I think that's going to continue.  People keep saying \"institutional buying\" will stop it, but why?  Institutions will drop a tanking asset just as fast as regular investors will.  We had institutional investment last cycle and it didn't stop or slow anything down.  We have even more institutional investment now and the volatility we've seen so far in this bull market looks just like previous bull markets.\n\nNow it's important to remember that so far, every single crypto bull market has ended in a huge blowoff top where the ATH rockets up by 2-3x in the last month.  Most of that 90% correction comes from this blowoff top.

Not that a really great UI isn't a super important thing for increasing adoption.  But infrastructural projects that contribute at the smart contract layer provide functionality; throwing a UI on top is then a permissionless process that opens things up to further innovation without fragmenting functionality/lidiquity -- e.g. look at what DefiSaver, Matcha, InstaDapp have all done based on top of 0x, Maker, Aave, etc.\n\nCan't think highly enough of **Uniswap**.  Still holding a bit of my airdrop (thought traded some of it for AAVE, so not *too* unhappy).  I really like Uniswap's fundamental approach, in that their contracts don't \"shut down\" when a new version comes out; that their whole UI is decentralizable; they really have a dedication to the overall spirit of \"trustless\" applications.  Not that I dislike Matcha, Sushi, and others :)\n\n**Aave** is another I really like. Not just something to be used directly, but they've published their API and I think their contracts are used as source of liquidity (and flash loans!) by a large number of downstream projects, farming and otherwise.  And they seem to have plenty of things on their roadmap, so project is lively.  AAVE Token is nice -- the staking, collateral, and governance power makes it rather nice.  But it has a history of multi-month 50% slow bleeds in price -- so if you don't buy at right time, it can be frustrating. \n\nI like **Loopring**, but I want to like it a lot more than I do. They put a lot of incredible effort into it, especially getting their ZK Rollup working.  But there always seems to be something missing. One example is that. their AMM system lacks routing on the UI layer.  So I can't trade e.g AAVE -> USDC, I have to manually click \"AAVE<>ETH\" pool, trade to ETH, then trade to \"ETH<>USDC\".  Make that a one-click trade with routing, like Uniswap does!  This just adds friction to the user experience.  Also inconsistent tokens between the AMMs and the Order Book (e.g. LINK in one, but not the other).  Token is appreciating in price, but I'm unclear on the tokenomics of the v3.6 loopring, need to revisit (the older system seems complex and awkward to use).\n\nSpeak of which, I really like **Chainlink**.  While they currently are running a bit of a walled garden in terms of *becoming* an oracle provider, the effort they're putting into making a truly enterprise-grade oracle framework is astounding.  People who compare them to BAND etc, I think are missing the fact that an oracle network is strongest due to it's *offchain* resilience, not it's on-chain presence.  I'm unsure of the LINK token itself though. Outside of LINK staking, not sure what drives the valuation.  And LINK staking isn't out yet, and I don't think it'll be quite what people expect.  I've got some, but it's been sorely underperforming, especially given how *omnipresent* the Chainlink project is.\n\nAnother one running behind the scenes that not as many notice is **0x Protocol**.  It's the reason Matcha.xyz has \"buyer pays gas\" limit orders.  One of the few that seems to be *entirely* API, with no canonical UI at all.  Haven't investigated the token, but maybe I should revisit some time.\n\nCurrently eyeing **Polygon / Matic**. I want to like it, inter-chain stuff is definitely not going to go away. I do prefer Ethereum-centered sidechains like Matic over independent ones like DOT; if for no other reason than the security is at least notionally tied to Etherereum's.  I haven't fully evaluated the risks of staking with Matic, still making up my mind.\n\nRelating to that, really like the wealth of L2 projects out there.  Everyone's crazy about **Optimism VM**, and yeah, I'm really excited.  But optistic rollups in general require a \"watcher\" to submit proofs of misbehavior in a timely manner, which feels very fragile to me.  \n\nZK Rollups seem much more like the far future to me -- more upfront processing cost, but they submit positive proofs only, so no need for a watcher.  The two things they're lacking are generic Solidity / EVM support, and proper decentralization (so it's not all running through one zkrollup proving server!).  **StarkWare** is one I'm watching closely here, they're powering ImmutableX and some others, have a generic zkRollup with their own language (Cairo), seem to be working on Solidity > Cairo compilation, and long term roadmap is working towards full decentralization.

This potentially gives XTK a longer lifespan than it's more popular competition if liquidity farming is a trend and what we saw in Defi Summer is unsustainable.\n\nSo XTK will take some share of the rewards they harvest for the automation they provide. The number of tokens they offer service for will bloom into the dozens. The profit will scale with the protocols they are servicing. The XTK coin will be valuable because it will have some share of the profit. The PE will trend towards 20 in the long run. If this bull case comes true let's consider what a market cap of 4.5M means. What is 5-20% of the voting fees on dozens of platforms worth if crypto as a whole succeeds and seriously disrupts finance?\n\nWell, ~60% of the fees on KNC go to voters (a small protocol they already have).

Let's say XTK captures 10% of the voting market and then takes 10% of your voting reward for their automation (and converting the rewards to more KNC). 16M rewards would net XTK about $160k. PE 20 would put the token at 3.2M. That's for 1 (one!) token out of their set and certainly not the largest one.\n\nNow how much profit are all banks + stock exchanges + all music labels, etc making. You know, those industries Ethereum is trying to cut all the parasitic middlemen out of. Now divide that profit amongst Defi offerings for voting. Now take like 5% of that profit (XTK voting fees) and multiply by 20 (PE). Surely it's in the billions. Do your own estimation but the current market cap of XTK is 4.5M. Rank 1156. That's lower than literal scams and it's a safer thesis than any given coin succeeding as their Defi offering.\n\nSo yeah, I think its worth speculatively holding what I farm after I sell enough to pay for my taxes on the profit.
