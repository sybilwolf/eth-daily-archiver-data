My two ~~cents~~gwei is that I'm firmly behind the QuickMerge idea as priority.\n\n---\n\nI'm finding the idea of the Quick-Merge proposal (as ref'd in issue 278) really persuasive as a next step.  I know it doesn't get everything up and running in it's final state (no withdrawals, etc), and would have it's own complexity (still have to keep ETH1 & ETH2 services running, and RPC comm channels are always a headache). But the whole PoS transition is going to be complex regardless, with a LOT of moving parts, ranging from software, to sysops, to social.\n\nIf there's one principle I've learned about complex software updates, it's *\"evolutionary not revolutionary\"*.  This means, don't try to take large changes all in one go (a \"revolution\").  If the change is large enough, frequently it's beneficial to head the opposite way:  Split them into as many small steps as needed, so that each step represents a a stable transition from one state of the software to another; with the code being runnable at every step (a slow \"evolution\")\n\nThere does need to be a balance.  Breaking things up like that does add some overhead you wouldn't spend otherwise -- each transition is extra effort testing, deploying, bugfixing.  But the benefit is that you reduce the number of moving parts, which makes it easier for human minds to encompass and review.  And by minimizing the number of changes per step, you minimize the surface area of things that can go wrong.  Most critically, you also minimize the number of things that have to be patched or walked back if something *does* go wrong.\n\nThe Quick Merge idea feels like that to me. It doesn't get us all the way there.  But the jump from PoW to PoS is innately a huge one operationally, so I think it's prudent to minimize the other things that are changing in the first big step.

My two <del>cents</del>gwei is that I&#39;m firmly behind the QuickMerge idea as priority.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I&#39;m finding the idea of the Quick-Merge proposal (as ref&#39;d in issue 278) really persuasive as a next step.  I know it doesn&#39;t get everything up and running in it&#39;s final state (no withdrawals, etc), and would have it&#39;s own complexity (still have to keep ETH1 &amp; ETH2 services running, and RPC comm channels are always a headache). But the whole PoS transition is going to be complex regardless, with a LOT of moving parts, ranging from software, to sysops, to social.</p>\n\n<p>If there&#39;s one principle I&#39;ve learned about complex software updates, it&#39;s <em>&quot;evolutionary not revolutionary&quot;</em>.  This means, don&#39;t try to take large changes all in one go (a &quot;revolution&quot;).  If the change is large enough, frequently it&#39;s beneficial to head the opposite way:  Split them into as many small steps as needed, so that each step represents a a stable transition from one state of the software to another; with the code being runnable at every step (a slow &quot;evolution&quot;)</p>\n\n<p>There does need to be a balance.  Breaking things up like that does add some overhead you wouldn&#39;t spend otherwise -- each transition is extra effort testing, deploying, bugfixing.  But the benefit is that you reduce the number of moving parts, which makes it easier for human minds to encompass and review.  And by minimizing the number of changes per step, you minimize the surface area of things that can go wrong.  Most critically, you also minimize the number of things that have to be patched or walked back if something <em>does</em> go wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The Quick Merge idea feels like that to me.

I asked him this question and he said right now they&#39;ve busted their ass to scale to ~40 qbits, and they&#39;ve essentially reached the limit that they can scale with existing methods.  </p>\n\n<p>So to scale past even 40 bits they will require techniques that haven&#39;t been discovered yet. Let alone scaling to 256 bits. The impression I got from him was that they&#39;re nowhere close, he more or less laughed away the concern.  </p>\n\n<p>So your friend who thinks working at IBM qualifies him to make such predictions is probably grossly overestimating his competence.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-25 13:32:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gs7qyw1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mcrcgt","parent_id":"t1_gs7eg7k","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Canadiens1993","body":"Quantum computing risk to crypto is a red-herring.
