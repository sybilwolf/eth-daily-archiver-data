In the same way, if it depreciates such that 0.031 ETH is worth $10, then I\u2019d lose money or sell for less than what I intended at the time of purchase. </p>\n\n<p>So I wouldn\u2019t be worried about the changing value of Ether being a barrier for new entry. The biggest barrier people are talking about now are gas fees for Ethereum transactions - which is tied to transaction volume, not ether value.

The way miners work, each miner has to look at the outstanding actions everyone on the Ethereum network is making (sending ether and interacting with contracts), and process them to update the blockchain. The fee system compensates those miners for using their computers to both process the transactions and/or run code, as well as solve the computational puzzle required to maintain the integrity or \"security\" of the blockchain. Unfortunately, the current method of adding new transactions to the blockchain (proof of work) is very computationally expensive. Not only do miners have to invest in hardware and storage that can hold the entire history of the blockchain, process new transactions, and solve the hard puzzle to participate in \"proof of work\", doing these things also costs electricity. So there must be a financial incentive for miners to process transactions, thus making the Ethereum network work. To ensure miners make a profit (i.e compensation from fees outweighs electricity costs), given the cost of doing a transaction, such as the computational work a miners hardware setup has to do in order to facilitate you buying my $50 NFT, the gas fee system implements a transaction cost. Part of what drives this cost up aside from how complex the transaction is and completing the proof of work is transaction volume. If 20 people are processing transactions, but there are hundreds of miners, supply and demand dictates that the cost is cheap because the demand is low but supply is high (the software behind a miner setup allows them to choose which transactions to process first). But if the number of miners is dwarfed by a large number of users who want to get their transactions processed, miners are incentivized to choose the highest prices; thus users get into a bidding war over who's transactions get processed.

Maybe some ETH predictions on CT caused this :) So Ill just write down my thoughts, maybe some of you havent thought about it in that way. As I said there are some predictions/ assumptions (e.g. ETH prize in 2025) in this post and obviously those could be wrong and you could have a different view/ opinion, but for the sake of the idea, please ignore this if youre not with me.   \nIts 2025. ETH is 100k+. A lot of people will be chasing 1 whole ETH and owning a validator will be bigger than having 1 BTC, way bigger. But those of us that have been part of crypto since 2017/2018 or even earlier will of course be in a different situation. Lets assume we had diamond hands, even through the next bear market (assuming there again is a 4 year cycle and this bull's peak is Q4 21 or Q1 22 + 2 years of bear market) and havent sold until 100k. At one point a lot of people will take profit. If ETH really nears a 6digit prize Ill take profits and derisk. My goal is not to sell all my holdings, but I guess around 30-40%. But what does that mean? \n\nMy take is: **my investment/ profit will never leave the system. Never.** In 4 years taking profits and derisiking probably doesnt mean going back to FIAT and dealing with traditional finance. It means having stable coins and depositing somewhere to earn 5% APY (I dont believe that we will see longterm 10% APY like nowerdays, but defi will have higher yields than trad finance / banks for some more years). It means buying stock. Either tokenized stocks or synth stocks. Ill be able to buy an stock index via $index. It means getting 3-5% APY on your validator (via e.g. RPL), potentially selling the ETH for more stable coins. Or Ill be investing in NFTs. Or ill try to double up again by throwing money into some small caps. Need money for something? Traveling? Going out? Youll have a (near) feeless crypto credit card that will allow you to buy whatever you want. \n\nI guess this is what whales do each and every day in 2021. They already live like that, with some limits of course (fees, some services still not developed, e.g. tokenized stocks), but you get the point. \n\nThere might be one exception to this: real estate. At least where I live (and might want to buy a house) I guess tokenized real estate wont be a thing in the time frame I am talking about. So I probably have to convert to FIAT to pay for the house and also the legal stuff/ settlement wont happen on ETH. But even that will come to \"defi\" / ETH / crypto, I am sure. \n\nReally being bankless wont be a problem in 4-5 years.
