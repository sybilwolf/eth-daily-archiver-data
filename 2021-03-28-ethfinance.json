The more sophisticated investor in crypto should be able to look beyond the narrative/shills, and see the real potential in the asset and the solid infrastructure development achieved to date and conclude that ETH will unquestionably come out ahead.  The reality is that the number of sophisticated investors in crypto are still few and far between.  So, sit back, relax and take comfort in knowing that you are early and that once EIP 1559, The Merge and L2 solutions get rolled out the value proposition of ETH will no longer be narrative, but fundamentals...and you can guess where the price will go.
