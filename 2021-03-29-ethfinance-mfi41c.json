Intellectual property is a serious problem for artists and copyright owners who want to get their properties into consumer printing. Piracy is the biggest concern. Locking in the workflow into a walled garden with DRM assets won't work because people will find ways to get those assets cracked. And open source hardware/software is more in tune with the DIY spirit of the hobby.\n\nA major example would be miniature wargaming, where Games Workshop (Warhammer40k) l has been reluctant to address the elephant in the room, where a noticable minority of gamers have been printing figure proxies from various third party sources and where GW has been so quick to litigate IP infringement without addressing the much bigger issue at hand. Unless they find a way to monetize 3D printing, they'll get left behind in about a decade when anyone can pick up a reasonably high quality resin printer to make some models for pennies on the dollar.

Is it logical that it differs? Yes, because it comes down to risk tolerance.\n\nInstitutions favour low risk. ETH currently has higher implementation risk i.e. there is a risk that things go wrong. Looking at the market as a whole, institutions do not distinguish between different coins - they want \u2018crypto\u2019 exposure, and at the moment that means picking the least volatile coin (relatively!) and the one that isn\u2019t undergoing big transformation. That\u2019s enough for them at the moment. \n\nThe aforementioned risk means that rewards are also likely to be greater i.e. ETH will outperform BTC, as it has done. But what that means for portfolio managers is that you only need a smaller allocation of ETH to get the same USD return as BTC.\n\nWhy is it different for individuals? Firstly, we can afford to accept more risk. It\u2019s our money and we\u2019ve done more research, so we chase alpha. \n\nThere is less information asymmetry. Depending on how much time you dedicate reading about the ecosystem, you\u2019re probably aware of many things that are happening that others are not. You only have to go to r/cc to see that people do not understand basic concepts. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that these are priced in (not suggesting r/cc moves the market, but broader retail exposure will).\n\nI also personally don\u2019t think that BTC is diversification. The crypto market moves in unison, save for fundamental news or hype. Yes BTC dips less, but unless you are choosing to sell for good at that moment, it doesn\u2019t matter. Your portfolio may be higher with BTC at these points, but the only time it matters is the time you sell. And for the reason above, ETH is where the alpha is. Holding BTC in this regard is only limiting your upside (unless you actually believe in its value proposition).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>From an institutional standpoint I agree, but from an individual standpoint I don\u2019t. Is it logical that it differs? Yes, because it comes down to risk tolerance.</p>\n\n<p>Institutions favour low risk. ETH currently has higher implementation risk i.e. there is a risk that things go wrong. Looking at the market as a whole, institutions do not distinguish between different coins - they want \u2018crypto\u2019 exposure, and at the moment that means picking the least volatile coin (relatively!) and the one that isn\u2019t undergoing big transformation. That\u2019s enough for them at the moment. </p>\n\n<p>The aforementioned risk means that rewards are also likely to be greater i.e. ETH will outperform BTC, as it has done. But what that means for portfolio managers is that you only need a smaller allocation of ETH to get the same USD return as BTC.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it different for individuals? Firstly, we can afford to accept more risk. It\u2019s our money and we\u2019ve done more research, so we chase alpha. </p>\n\n<p>There is less information asymmetry. Depending on how much time you dedicate reading about the ecosystem, you\u2019re probably aware of many things that are happening that others are not. You only have to go to <a href=\"/r/cc\">r/cc</a> to see that people do not understand basic concepts. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that these are priced in (not suggesting <a href=\"/r/cc\">r/cc</a> moves the market, but broader retail exposure will).</p>\n\n<p>I also personally don\u2019t think that BTC is diversification. The crypto market moves in unison, save for fundamental news or hype. Yes BTC dips less, but unless you are choosing to sell for good at that moment, it doesn\u2019t matter.

Idk lol.. just rambling right now :P)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I should definitely add some explanation and tips in the statistics page (for example, you can click on any bar in the blocks charts to be redirected to the etherscan page for that block), but I shouldn&#39;t spend too much time on this side (hobby) project right now, so I&#39;ll have to delay that..</p>\n\n<p>So after this wall of text, if you want to take a look: <del>redacted link</del> (not sure it looks pleasant on mobile, browse at your own risk :D)</p>\n\n<p>If the site doesn&#39;t load at all, it&#39;s because it&#39;s self hosted and my upload speed isn&#39;t capable of handling many people. I still had quite a lot of headroom last time, but if it&#39;s not loading don&#39;t waste your time :P</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;ll implement any of the things I&#39;ve said because I need to study and the website itself is pretty much ready for its initial purpose (school project), but I&#39;d like to know about cool ideas nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p>Probably keeping it online for 1-2 hours maximum..</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-29 08:22:17","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-29 11:09:14","id":"gsp27sj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mfi41c","parent_id":"t3_mfi41c","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"It's a cool idea.

Thank you to those who have come to the AMA of the DApp Korea community. Today, we have the Hermes Network as a guest. Hi! Please introduce yourself and the project from the speaker who is with you today.\n\nG: Hello, this is Tony. I am in charge of communication in the Hermes Network.\n\nG: Hermez is a layer 2 solution that provides scalability to token transfers based on Ethereum. Hermez can process up to 2000 transactions per second and is designed for high-transfer tokens such as Ether, Dai, LabBTC, etc.\n\nG: Hermez is a zero-knowledge rollup, utilizing zkSNARK to address proof of verification and on-chain data availability.\n\nG: We just launched on the Ethereum mainnet. It was about 30 minutes ago. Today is a very, very important day for our project. :D\n\nQ1. I would like to ask a question about the specific features of the Ethereum-level security guaranteed by zk-SNARKs applied to the Hermes network.\n\nA1. The zkSNARKs used in Ethereum are called bn128 pairing. It belongs to a considerable level of advanced cryptography, was introduced by the Zcash community, and applied as a precompiled smart contract on Ethereum.\n\nQ2. Looking at Optimism, they are aggressively collaborating with other DeFi projects. Does Hermez have any other De-fi project and partnership plans?\n\nA2. of course. First of all, we are an open source project that anyone can use, contribute to, and apply our code. We also have many projects and partnership programs in the field. Hermez is an open API/SDK and you can use any project.\nTether is a token that occupies an important part of Ethereum. Tether currently accounts for 30 percent of network gas costs and will benefit from the Hermes network application. The Tether team has already announced the use of Hermez.\nHowever, Hermez is also open to all other ERC tokens. Currently, ETH, HEZ, USDT, USDC, DAI, WBTC can be transferred from Hermez. More tokens will be added in the future. Soon, anyone will be able to register tokens in the system.\n\nQ3. The promotion part of HEZ distribution is divided into 3 types. How is it used?\n\nA3. One of the big problems before the rollup is'minimum volume' to make a profit. Hermez is the project with the lowest break-even point for this right now, but still has the homework to reach the break-even point.\nTherefore, from now on, we will focus on promoting some of the HEZ tokens and promoting network utilization.\n\nQ4. Looking at Hermez's token economy, it uses Proof-of-Donation Mechanism. Here it is stated that 30% of the tokens will be burned. I am curious about the reason for burning such a large amount of tokens.\n\nA4. It is a very important point for Hermez that a significant amount of collected HEZ is actually incinerated. (Hermez uses the auction method, where the coordinator collects the transaction fee HEZ) The auction incentive amount should be very difficult for bidders to manipulate. Therefore, 30% of tokens are burned, and 40% contributes to L1 (Ethereum). The remaining 30% goes back to the promoters as a reward.\nDonations back to L1 also play a significant role. Because we run on L1 (Ethereum), we can make a better L2 through the process of making a better L1 system.\n\nQ5. First, let's assume one case.\n\u201cAssume there is a coordinator N who has staked X HEZ. Here, transaction T occurs in which F funds are withdrawn from HEZ L2 to the mainnet. Here, N above will create a batch with the highest donation bid amount D. If your donation amount + total value of staked HEZ is lower than F, N will have an incentive for transaction cheating.\u201d\n5\u20131. Because Hermez uses rollups, he knows that the state route of the upcoming batch must match the previous state route. So, is it basically impossible to cheat like the above?\nIf the above is true, is there no need for penalties such as slashing because the coordinators' evil actions are essentially blocked? Where can a bad actor risk occur, and how is it resolved?\n\nA5. First of all, let me explain how an auction (auction) works.\nAnyone on the network can bid on a slot purchase.\nOne slot is a period of 40 blocks and is approximately 10 minutes. Here, the coordinator (auction winner) can create as many batches as he wants. The coordinator takes a fee for every transaction put into the batch.\nThe auction is conducted with HEZ tokens, 30% of the HEZ collected at the auction is burned, 40% is donated, and 30% is taken by the successful bidder as described above.\n5\u20131. Operators can only change state for verified transactions. (Signed transactions of users with sufficient balance \u2026.etc) This is guaranteed by zkSNARK proof!\nThis is the key difference between the traditional Optimistic Rollup and Snark Proof. Optimistic rollups do not have such proofs and therefore have a challenge period.\nHowever, for zk rollups like Hermez, the validity of the transaction is guaranteed through encrypted proof. zkrollup has faster finalization. And in zk rollup, operators don't need to deposit any funds.\nI'm skeptical about the optimistic rollup. Because, in my opinion, these challenge games are complex. In the zk rollup, you have to perform difficult proof operations. However, once the proof goes on-chain, you can be sure that this transaction is final.\nAt Hermez, we developed a Prover, or Prover, that can process about 1912 transactions in 60 seconds. And this prover can work in parallel. In this way, we can achieve 100 times the scalability of existing Ethereum. (This is the premise that we use all of the Ethereum network)\nHowever, this is only the first version, and we can make further improvements in space and proof computation time to increase transactions per batch.\n\nQ6. With the recent NFT boom, I think you will get a lot of questions about NFT. Do you think the Hermez network needs NFT?\n\nA6. There is no direct relationship between Hermez and the NFT. However, Hermes' payment scalability technology can be used for other protocol scalability based on NFT.\n\nA6\u20132. NFTs are currently producing very high hype. Hermez is focused on token transfer, which is Hermez's core goal. This is currently in its infancy, and we want to deliver value to users by securing a smooth payment network.\nBut we can issue an NFT someday. Is there a project of community members who want to support this?\n\nQ7. The recent cryptocurrency market is very sensitive to security issues. Various projects have suffered damage from many investors due to hacking attacks. What is the safety of Hermez Network as a result of Hermez's security audit?\n\nA7. We have received three independent audits for our circuit and smart contracts, and we have also conducted several internal audits. We are also running a bug bounty program. Of course, this does not make it clear that there are no bugs. However, we are convinced that everything is in good shape, and security is our top priority at Hermez. Nevertheless, users using the system are urged to fully understand the network risk.\n\nQ8. Please explain the token matrix of the HEZ token. And I would like to know what are the conditions for token staking.\n\nA8. Information on our token matrix can be found at https://hermez.io/tokenomics/ and in the white paper.\nIn response to staking, we are looking at the different incentives that users can deposit into Layer 2. However, there is no definite part yet. We plan to update this to the community in the future.\nStaking is essential for liquidity. This is necessary for the slot auctions to be fair. Tokens used for staking are reinvested for network development. For example, 30% of the tokens collected at the auction are returned to network users as rewards.\n\nQ9. Currently, there are numerous projects appearing in the cryptocurrency market. What is Hermez's marketing strategy to survive in the meantime, and do you have any plans to enter the Korean market?\n\nA9. Over the past few months, we've been working on product development and have been in stealth mode.\nFrom now on, you can see the Hermes team making a louder voice. We plan to participate in various events, AMAs, and meetups around the world. We will also email monthly news starting next week, so the community is always up to date and updated.\nWe are always open to building a healthy Korean community. Please come up with a variety of ideas!\n\nQ10. What is Hermez's ultimate goal?\n\nA10. Hermez's ultimate goal is to spread cryptocurrency to everyone around the world.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s their AMA, translated: (<a href=\"/u/BakedEnt\">u/BakedEnt</a> )\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/despread-creative/dappkorea-ama-recap-5-%ED%97%A4%EB%A5%B4%EB%A9%94%EC%A6%88-hermez-ab945cc5f53e\">https://medium.com/despread-creative/dappkorea-ama-recap-5-%ED%97%A4%EB%A5%B4%EB%A9%94%EC%A6%88-hermez-ab945cc5f53e</a></p>\n\n<p>M: Hello!

And in zk rollup, operators don&#39;t need to deposit any funds.\nI&#39;m skeptical about the optimistic rollup. Because, in my opinion, these challenge games are complex. In the zk rollup, you have to perform difficult proof operations. However, once the proof goes on-chain, you can be sure that this transaction is final.\nAt Hermez, we developed a Prover, or Prover, that can process about 1912 transactions in 60 seconds. And this prover can work in parallel. In this way, we can achieve 100 times the scalability of existing Ethereum. (This is the premise that we use all of the Ethereum network)\nHowever, this is only the first version, and we can make further improvements in space and proof computation time to increase transactions per batch.</p>\n\n<p>Q6. With the recent NFT boom, I think you will get a lot of questions about NFT. Do you think the Hermez network needs NFT?</p>\n\n<p>A6. There is no direct relationship between Hermez and the NFT. However, Hermes&#39; payment scalability technology can be used for other protocol scalability based on NFT.</p>\n\n<p>A6\u20132. NFTs are currently producing very high hype. Hermez is focused on token transfer, which is Hermez&#39;s core goal. This is currently in its infancy, and we want to deliver value to users by securing a smooth payment network.\nBut we can issue an NFT someday. Is there a project of community members who want to support this?</p>\n\n<p>Q7. The recent cryptocurrency market is very sensitive to security issues. Various projects have suffered damage from many investors due to hacking attacks. What is the safety of Hermez Network as a result of Hermez&#39;s security audit?</p>\n\n<p>A7. We have received three independent audits for our circuit and smart contracts, and we have also conducted several internal audits. We are also running a bug bounty program. Of course, this does not make it clear that there are no bugs. However, we are convinced that everything is in good shape, and security is our top priority at Hermez. Nevertheless, users using the system are urged to fully understand the network risk.</p>\n\n<p>Q8. Please explain the token matrix of the HEZ token. And I would like to know what are the conditions for token staking.</p>\n\n<p>A8. Information on our token matrix can be found at <a href=\"https://hermez.io/tokenomics/\">https://hermez.io/tokenomics/</a> and in the white paper.\nIn response to staking, we are looking at the different incentives that users can deposit into Layer 2. However, there is no definite part yet. We plan to update this to the community in the future.\nStaking is essential for liquidity. This is necessary for the slot auctions to be fair. Tokens used for staking are reinvested for network development. For example, 30% of the tokens collected at the auction are returned to network users as rewards.</p>\n\n<p>Q9. Currently, there are numerous projects appearing in the cryptocurrency market. What is Hermez&#39;s marketing strategy to survive in the meantime, and do you have any plans to enter the Korean market?</p>\n\n<p>A9. Over the past few months, we&#39;ve been working on product development and have been in stealth mode.\nFrom now on, you can see the Hermes team making a louder voice. We plan to participate in various events, AMAs, and meetups around the world. We will also email monthly news starting next week, so the community is always up to date and updated.\nWe are always open to building a healthy Korean community. Please come up with a variety of ideas!</p>\n\n<p>Q10. What is Hermez&#39;s ultimate goal?</p>\n\n<p>A10. Hermez&#39;s ultimate goal is to spread cryptocurrency to everyone around the world.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-29 13:40:49","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-29 13:44:17","id":"gsq82ck","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mfi41c","parent_id":"t1_gsq75wh","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"Thank you for sharing / translating.
