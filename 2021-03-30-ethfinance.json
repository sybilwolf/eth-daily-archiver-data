Uniswap removed it from their frontend/website to keep volume numbers accurate. I believe you can still trade it by interacting with the Uniswap smart contract directly as they can't sensor that (yay Ethereum!), they can only censor their website which people use to interact with Uniswap contracts.\n\nI'm not an expert and the specifics as to how the fake volume is created goes beyond my understanding. Personally, I defend Uniswap's right to do this.

I think BTC is successful because it accomplished what it intended to do - 21m, fixed supply, etc. However, as we have experienced in the last 20 years, innovation in technology will move forward and improve. The question I ask myself is will this technology be more relevant in the next 5-20 years? Seeing how quickly defi and nft were adopted I would say so. However, nothing is guaranteed. Innovation does not JUST happen. It takes time, energy, and a lot of mistakes along the way. ETHs value prop is that it has a great ecosystem and looks a lot closer to achieving its vision. Can it fail? Always a possibility. But I believe that it will innovate and get better and I\u2019m essentially investing in that.

My 2c","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Appreciate you sharing and I think it\u2019s always good to hear different perspectives. I think BTC is successful because it accomplished what it intended to do - 21m, fixed supply, etc. However, as we have experienced in the last 20 years, innovation in technology will move forward and improve. The question I ask myself is will this technology be more relevant in the next 5-20 years? Seeing how quickly defi and nft were adopted I would say so. However, nothing is guaranteed. Innovation does not JUST happen. It takes time, energy, and a lot of mistakes along the way. ETHs value prop is that it has a great ecosystem and looks a lot closer to achieving its vision. Can it fail? Always a possibility. But I believe that it will innovate and get better and I\u2019m essentially investing in that.

Bitcoin was created to solve the problem of trust with governments and to be money that can be sent/received anywhere/anytime without permission or trust of anyone else. Bitcoin\u2019s narrative matches the real world utility. Ethereum still can't come up with a narrative and product market fit after all these years. \n\nThe fact is, ethereum is a scam that totally revolutionized scams and is the future of pyramid schemes (how many ERC20 pyramid scams and shitcoins run on top of ethereum again?), but it would still be a garbage shitcoin even if it was created without the premine scam.\n\nThe ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce uneducated (in cryptocurrency) people, but there is no persistence of a singular narrative and ethereum is still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. Satoshi created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else, and that's his own words. Bitcoin didn't have a premine, a developer fund/tax, and Satoshi never cashed out. Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their ethereum stack if they \ndon't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run, but you can also lose bitcoin.\n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (this cannot even be replicated)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every other founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nIn the launch strategy, ethereum decided to do something controversial at the time, a premine. Before ethereum, most cryptocurrency that had a premine were instantly labeled as untrustworthy/unfair by the cryptocurrency community. Ethereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million for the ICO participants to buy. The crypto community always knew that premines were scams but after ethereum, the premine scam stigma had been lifted and now we have countless altcoins that were all created to enrich their founders. \n\n1) Vitalik and many others in the ethereum space are known scammers because Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense to the credulous. \n\n[Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\n2) ETH is an illegal security according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp) with a premine of 72 million ETH. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine ignoring the 60 million they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security\n\n3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness\"\n\n4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency (like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) then every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not then what purpose does ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?\n\n5) Advertising immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks.\n\n6) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbies are misled into believing that ETH is decentralized.\n\n7) Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch soon and I have no expectation that the new ethereum will be any more successful than the current one it's still a centralized shitcoin controlled and ran by scammers.\n\n8) The fact that ethereum is switching over to staking rewards has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH unlike bitcoin being staked will expose you to taxes. Coinbase for example files a 1099-MISC for any user staking over 600 USD a year to the IRS.\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is a comment in response to me in the btc sub. </p>\n\n<p>NOT MY SENTIMENTS. </p>\n\n<p>curious of some of the educated sub members here perspectives. </p>\n\n<p>See below: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&amp;t=47m24s\">Click here to listen to a few minutes of bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talk about ethereum and Vitalik.</a> </p>\n\n<p>Jimmy worked directly with Vitalik from the beginning back when Vitalik worked on rootstock for bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum is a centralized scam.

Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they&#39;ve been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their ethereum stack if they \ndon&#39;t understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run, but you can also lose bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>Satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)</p></li>\n<li><p>Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)</p></li>\n<li><p>Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (this cannot even be replicated)</p></li>\n<li><p>Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every other founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the launch strategy, ethereum decided to do something controversial at the time, a premine. Before ethereum, most cryptocurrency that had a premine were instantly labeled as untrustworthy/unfair by the cryptocurrency community. Ethereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million for the ICO participants to buy. The crypto community always knew that premines were scams but after ethereum, the premine scam stigma had been lifted and now we have countless altcoins that were all created to enrich their founders. </p>\n\n<p>1) Vitalik and many others in the ethereum space are known scammers because Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense to the credulous. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/\">Gregory Maxwell: \u201cVitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam\u201d</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4\">Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23\">Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam</a></p>\n\n<p>2) ETH is an illegal security according to the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp\">Howey Test</a> with a premine of 72 million ETH. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine ignoring the 60 million they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security</p>\n\n<p>3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but &quot;rich statefulness&quot;</p>\n\n<p>4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency (like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) then every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution?

This is what it would look like based on the 2020 married filing joint brackets:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>10% up to $19,750 of Ordinary Income = $1,975</li>\n<li>12% up to the remaining $50,000 ($30,250) = $3,630</li>\n<li>0% LTCG on the 30k between $50,000 and $80,000.</li>\n<li>15% LTCG on $80,000 to $150,000 = $10,500</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It has to be this way because if we modify your scenario we come into situations like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Person A - $0 of income and $80,800 of capital gains = $0 tax bill</li>\n<li>Person B - $1 of income and $80,800 of capital gains = $12,120 tax bill.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Person B has the same capital gains as Person A but because they made $1 in income they owe $12,120 more in taxes.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: To change to 15% instead of 10% in my calcs</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-30 20:44:50","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-30 20:51:54","id":"gsvn7s1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mg8cy9","parent_id":"t1_gsvina8","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hipaces","body":"Ok, sorry about that.
