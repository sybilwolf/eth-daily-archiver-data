Also dollar looking strong and will likely continue rise.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-31 04:45:36","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-31 04:49:01","id":"gswlhbc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mgykyv","parent_id":"t1_gswgjux","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/LCFCKris","body":"Heyyy... that\u2019s pretty good.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Heyyy... that\u2019s pretty good.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-31 11:53:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gsy11ng","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mgykyv","parent_id":"t3_mgykyv","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/marinepenguinreborn","body":"Hmmm, that's mildy adequate","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hmmm, that&#39;s mildy adequate</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-31 11:56:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gsy1hds","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mgykyv","parent_id":"t1_gsy11ng","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/BakedEnt","body":"Please for the love of God ETH, don't pull BTC into price discovery mode....","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Please for the love of God ETH, don&#39;t pull BTC into price discovery mode....</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-31 12:16:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gsy40ni","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mgykyv","parent_id":"t3_mgykyv","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"I mean, FileCoin, OMG, TRX and EOS are kind of pulling eth to be fair","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I mean, FileCoin, OMG, TRX and EOS are kind of pulling eth to be fair</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-31 12:18:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gsy4dgu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mgykyv","parent_id":"t1_gsy40ni","score":-4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BakedEnt","body":"Ya drunk peg?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ya drunk peg?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-31 12:22:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gsy4sq9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mgykyv","parent_id":"t1_gsy4dgu","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"no?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/FgXxSAa","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>no?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/FgXxSAa\">https://imgur.com/a/FgXxSAa</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-31 12:25:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gsy5awx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mgykyv","parent_id":"t1_gsy4sq9","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BakedEnt","body":"Ok but there are no algo bots linking TRX or Filecoin to automate Bitcoin buys.

All of the governments of the world would make their centralized exchanges consult this server whenever coin is sent to them from an address.  If the address is blacklisted in their server, you don't get your loot.\n\nThere is no whitelist.  Once you send from a blacklisted address to any other address, that address would become blacklisted too.\n\nThe governments already \"worked together\" when they signed on to the FATF.  They're basically giving them responsibility for fucking this all up.\n\nSeriously, it could be as simple as a box sitting on some bureaucrats desk that's running 24/7.\n\nLook up the FATF on Wikipedia.  You'll get an idea of their scope.  All of these nations got sold on the idea of enforcing money laundering laws and combatting terrorism despite a lot of the obvious problems because it gives them power and it provides a pretext to take peoples' loot.\n\nStaking is interesting.  The address to which your rewards go to is on-chain.  So obviously if you stake with a blacklisted address, the address the rewards go to get blacklisted as well.\n\nAbout the only thing you can do with coins on a blacklisted address is use it for fees since fees are going to be burned.  But since fees have to come from the same address you're sending loot from it's pointless.\n\nSkipping fiat entirely is your answer.  Ethereum 2.0 may provide the TPS necessary that let's you do the fabled buy coffee with crypto scenario.\n\nBut this is why I'm very suspicious about what is going on right now and am so fearful that they're up to no good.  They surely see this.  Are they trying to kill the baby while it's still in the crib?  It's easy to be paranoid.\n\nLook at Ethereum 1.0 as our foot in the door.  DeFi works.  The fees aren't what we want, but it works.  My fear is we're being baited into moving into something too soon, something that gives them justification to regulate 2.0 out of existence.  The current plan is there is no Ethereum 1.0 to fall back to.\n\nIt's like fucking chess with these guys where they have a pocket full of rooks.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am assuming that it is the FATF that is running the server.

They&#39;re basically giving them responsibility for fucking this all up.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously, it could be as simple as a box sitting on some bureaucrats desk that&#39;s running 24/7.</p>\n\n<p>Look up the FATF on Wikipedia.  You&#39;ll get an idea of their scope.  All of these nations got sold on the idea of enforcing money laundering laws and combatting terrorism despite a lot of the obvious problems because it gives them power and it provides a pretext to take peoples&#39; loot.</p>\n\n<p>Staking is interesting.  The address to which your rewards go to is on-chain.  So obviously if you stake with a blacklisted address, the address the rewards go to get blacklisted as well.</p>\n\n<p>About the only thing you can do with coins on a blacklisted address is use it for fees since fees are going to be burned.  But since fees have to come from the same address you&#39;re sending loot from it&#39;s pointless.</p>\n\n<p>Skipping fiat entirely is your answer.  Ethereum 2.0 may provide the TPS necessary that let&#39;s you do the fabled buy coffee with crypto scenario.</p>\n\n<p>But this is why I&#39;m very suspicious about what is going on right now and am so fearful that they&#39;re up to no good.  They surely see this.  Are they trying to kill the baby while it&#39;s still in the crib?  It&#39;s easy to be paranoid.</p>\n\n<p>Look at Ethereum 1.0 as our foot in the door.  DeFi works.  The fees aren&#39;t what we want, but it works.  My fear is we&#39;re being baited into moving into something too soon, something that gives them justification to regulate 2.0 out of existence.  The current plan is there is no Ethereum 1.0 to fall back to.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like fucking chess with these guys where they have a pocket full of rooks.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-31 21:50:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gszxajo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mgykyv","parent_id":"t1_gszvcj2","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Ber10","body":"Just because they signed something doesnt make it law all over the world.

Bitcoin was created to solve the problem of trust with governments and to be money that can be sent/received anywhere/anytime without permission or trust of anyone else. Bitcoin\u2019s narrative matches the real world utility. Ethereum still can't come up with a narrative and product market fit after all these years. \n\nThe fact is, ethereum is a scam that totally revolutionized scams and is the future of pyramid schemes (how many ERC20 pyramid scams and shitcoins run on top of ethereum again?), but it would still be a garbage shitcoin even if it was created without the premine scam.\n\nThe ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce uneducated (in cryptocurrency) people, but there is no persistence of a singular narrative and ethereum is still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.\n\nOver 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. Satoshi created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else, and that's his own words. Bitcoin didn't have a premine, a developer fund/tax, and Satoshi never cashed out. Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their ethereum stack if they \ndon't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run, but you can also lose bitcoin.\n\nSatoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly:\n\n* No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)\n\n* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)\n\n* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (this cannot even be replicated)\n\n* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every other founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)\n\nIn the launch strategy, ethereum decided to do something controversial at the time, a premine. Before ethereum, most cryptocurrency that had a premine were instantly labeled as untrustworthy/unfair by the cryptocurrency community. Ethereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million for the ICO participants to buy. The crypto community always knew that premines were scams but after ethereum, the premine scam stigma had been lifted and now we have countless altcoins that were all created to enrich their founders. \n\n1) Vitalik and many others in the ethereum space are known scammers because Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense to the credulous. \n\n(http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)\n\n[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)\n\n[Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)\n\n2) ETH is an illegal security according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp) with a premine of 72 million ETH. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine ignoring the 60 million they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security\n\n3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but \"rich statefulness\"\n\n4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency (like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) then every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not then what purpose does ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?\n\n5) Advertising immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks.\n\n6) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbies are misled into believing that ETH is decentralized.\n\n7) Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch soon and I have no expectation that the new ethereum will be any more successful than the current one it's still a centralized shitcoin controlled and ran by scammers.\n\n8) The fact that ethereum is switching over to staking rewards has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH unlike bitcoin being staked will expose you to taxes. Coinbase for example files a 1099-MISC for any user staking over 600 USD a year to the IRS.\n\nEthereum scam part 1 - [Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0)\n\nEthereum scam part 2 - [Here we take a look at the value & business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it's one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4)\n\nEthereum scam part 3 - [The ethereum scam part 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg)\n\nhttps://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\n\n[Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is a comment in response to me in the btc sub. </p>\n\n<p>NOT MY SENTIMENTS. </p>\n\n<p>curious of some of the educated sub members here perspectives. </p>\n\n<p>See below: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&amp;t=47m24s\">Click here to listen to a few minutes of bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talk about ethereum and Vitalik.</a> </p>\n\n<p>Jimmy worked directly with Vitalik from the beginning back when Vitalik worked on rootstock for bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum is a centralized scam.

Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run, but you can also lose bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>Satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>No premine (Satoshi didn\u2019t grant himself any coins)</p></li>\n<li><p>Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)</p></li>\n<li><p>Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (this cannot even be replicated)</p></li>\n<li><p>Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every other founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the launch strategy, ethereum decided to do something controversial at the time, a premine. Before ethereum, most cryptocurrency that had a premine were instantly labeled as untrustworthy/unfair by the cryptocurrency community. Ethereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million for the ICO participants to buy. The crypto community always knew that premines were scams but after ethereum, the premine scam stigma had been lifted and now we have countless altcoins that were all created to enrich their founders. </p>\n\n<p>1) Vitalik and many others in the ethereum space are known scammers because Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense to the credulous. </p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/\">http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/</a>)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4\">Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23\">Vitalik\u2019s Quantum Scam</a></p>\n\n<p>2) ETH is an illegal security according to the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp\">Howey Test</a> with a premine of 72 million ETH. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine ignoring the 60 million they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security</p>\n\n<p>3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but &quot;rich statefulness&quot;</p>\n\n<p>4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency (like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) then every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not then what purpose does ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?</p>\n\n<p>5) Advertising immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks.</p>\n\n<p>6) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbies are misled into believing that ETH is decentralized.</p>\n\n<p>7) Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch soon and I have no expectation that the new ethereum will be any more successful than the current one it&#39;s still a centralized shitcoin controlled and ran by scammers.</p>\n\n<p>8) The fact that ethereum is switching over to staking rewards has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH unlike bitcoin being staked will expose you to taxes. Coinbase for example files a 1099-MISC for any user staking over 600 USD a year to the IRS.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum scam part 1 - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0\">Here we focus on the Ethereum token pre-sale which to anyone with any financial experience, is an obvious sale of an unlicensed unregistered security.</a></p>\n\n<p>Ethereum scam part 2 - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCiHTJRbIf4\">Here we take a look at the value &amp; business proposition of Decentralized Smart Contracts and why it&#39;s one of the dumbest ways to make your business more efficient.</a></p>\n\n<p>Ethereum scam part 3 - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFXqVpGDNg\">The ethereum scam part 3.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36\">https://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxtVLjCxPDU\">Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are Scams and so are the developers that build on them</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-30 23:15:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gsvzlub","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mgykyv","parent_id":"t3_mgykyv","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/headwar","body":"There was talk here that using a certain service helps reduce gas when lp-ing. zapper?

An edict like this would necessarily split ETH in two - \"whitelisted\" ETH that can be spent anywhere, and \"blacklisted\" ETH that cannot touch any financial exchange regulated under the FATF, but can still be spent on transaction fees, staked, and exchanged at unregulated DEXes and any centralized exchanges that are not subject to FATF rules.\n\nInterestingly, the fee burn in EIP 1559 makes it impossible to launder blacklisted coins into whitelisted coins simply by becoming a staker and paying them to yourself as a transaction fee.

I didn't see a mention in the new guidelines, but I did only skim them. And as I mentioned, I think that it is impossible to put KYC on DeFi in practice since it's so trivially forkable in an anonymous way.\n\n> Shouldn't we have that choice? Supporting a fork gives it to us.\n\nI get the ideology, but I believe the Ethereum ecosystem just can't survive being fragmented like that right now. I believe there should be a single, trusted chain that the developers commit to upgrading, exchanges commit to supporting, and smart contract systems can support to be compatible with other systems.\n\n> We have Bitcoin devs claiming this or that potential exploit, can we dismiss 100% of that criticism as being rooted in bile?\n\nI think we can, actually. I haven't seen any practical systemic attack to be worried about (delaying finality, censoring transactions, confirming invalid transactions), and I also haven't seen any evidence of critical bugs aside from the clock sync bug that was found in testnet, which I admit was a rather big bug but was a very unique, one-off case that didn't threaten the safety of the network, just the liveness. My question is if Bitcoin devs have exploits for Ethereum's PoS, why aren't they publishing them? Why aren't they using them to crash the beacon chain to spin a narrative around Bitcoin maximalism? They could say that they're waiting for the PoS merge to unleash them, but the longer PoS runs flawlessly, the more I seriously doubt that the Bitcoin maxis have discovered exploits that top auditing firms plus hundreds of top security researchers worldwide have missed.\n\nI would gladly discuss any attack with a bitcoin maxi in detail. I'm not afraid of getting technical and down to the level of code.\n\n> An open source project that aims to upend the financial world uses a centralized (git is decentralized, github is most emphatically not) source code repository that just happens to be run by a company that makes its money primarily by selling proprietary software.\n\nBecause Git is decentralized, the dev team could pick up and move providers at a moment's notice, so the centralization isn't as much an issue. Say tomorrow Microsoft does something questionable, the devs could move the code trivially to Bitbucket, Gitlab or other provider (or even start emailing git patches to each other) by changing a setting in their Git clients. It might take a day or two to migrate the discussions and issues. Then they keep chugging along.\n\nIn other words, GitHub has almost zero vendor lock in for a code-only project like Ethereum.\n\n>  I should think it obvious what the concerns are: at a minimum you likely know the whereabouts of the many contributors throughout the day\n\nMicrosoft definitely knows the IP address and thus the general whereabouts of Ethereum contributors at the moment they browse GitHub or push code, but likely so does Google, and Apple, and cell phone providers and governments. We lost our location privacy as a species long ago. You have to just assume that as long as your cell phone is powered on, some government system somewhere is probably logging your position. So I would say it's a threat that's not unique to Microsoft.\n\n> you know who is slacking\n\nAnyone can look at the public commit history and tell who's slacking ;) No special privileges required.\n\n> you are probably able to affect the workstations used in some nefarious fashion\n\nVery unlikely. This would require a zero-day exploit in the Git protocol itself or a web browser, both of which are some of the most widely-used and highly-audited types of software in the world.\n\n> even the code itself? (an actor with access to Microsoft's resources could own SHA-1 if it wanted)\n\nWhile this may be true, the attack would be plainly visible as it would cause discrepancies in developers' local code repos, and likely cause their git clients to throw duplicate/conflicting object errors which would be investigated quickly. Then Microsoft would have to come up with a very elaborate story to cover their ass and not hemorrhage corporate customers due to such a preventable, obvious, widely studied and inexcusable security breach.\n\nOn another note, while collision attacks are viable on SHA-1 nowadays, I am pretty sure that preimage attacks are still not viable. That's the type of attack that could potentially have bearing on the security of a git project given an attacker outside the dev team.\n\n> There is also the question of, who is accessing the source code? ... What kinds of exploits can somebody with backdoor access to github achieve by contacting parties interested in the code out-of-band?\n\nHopefully everyone! All source code for Ethereum's Layer 1 is public as far as I know. Perhaps counterintuitively, sharing your code publicly generally leads to *less* exploits than closed-source code. This pattern is often touted by open-source proponents.\n\n> We've got miners apparently making threats of performing the unsupported fork; Microsoft or its assignees knows more about who these people are than the Foundation; would coordination with these miners somehow profit some group within? How is this not a problem?\n\nI can't think of any specific attack that GitHub could make against the Ethereum developers that (1) the developers could not easily detect, (2) the developers could not trivially move to a different git provider to avoid, and (3) wouldn't put Microsoft in massive hot water with their large corporate and government customers. But if there is a specific class of attack, I would be curious to hear it.\n\n> Microsoft's CEO looked the OSS community in the eye after the Github announcement and proclaimed that they were \"all-in on open source.\" Does that sound like a true statement to you?\n\nAs a developer, it does, honestly. I can't remember the last time a company purchased a developer tool and actively made it so much better to use. New CI/CD tools and hosted runners, Codespaces, the Arctic code vault, dependabot alerts, as a dev, GitHub is more of a joy to use for writing open source than it's ever been.\n\nAs a counterpoint you have Stack Overflow which has been slowly alienating its developer community over the same timeline in the name of short term profits and corporate bs. Microsoft really does care about the devs that use GitHub, at least in the sense that they are looking 10-20 years ahead to tastefully extract profit from a bustling open source community, rather than trying to squeeze their users today to pump their quarterlies.\n\n> we're letting them host Ethereum clients?\n\nThe binaries are authenticated via PGP, so Microsoft is only a bandwidth provider. Data integrity is verified by a separate un-forgeable signature.\n\n> Yes. We lose the miners. They're gone. There's no rolling back. I use all kinds of software and I accept updates largely on the premise that if I don't like what it does I can roll back. None of these OSs or applications are as important to me as Ethereum is, and yet this ends up being the sole software product I don't get to benefit from rolling back?\n\nI think there's a false equivalency comparing a software upgrade to a software *protocol* upgrade. With software, everyone can for the most part use whatever version they like. With a protocol, everyone communicating has to use the same version of the protocol or they can't communicate with each other. This is why Ethereum protocol upgrade hard forks happen in lockstep. At a specific predetermined block number all clients start using the new protocol suddenly, dropping the old protocol.\n\nBecause the Ethereum protocol is itself a consensus protocol, having multiple versions running at the same time necessarily means having two separate forks of the chain, but you get that!\n\nThis is comment 1/2, since I've run up against the 10,000 character limit.

And as I mentioned, I think that it is impossible to put KYC on DeFi in practice since it&#39;s so trivially forkable in an anonymous way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shouldn&#39;t we have that choice? Supporting a fork gives it to us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I get the ideology, but I believe the Ethereum ecosystem just can&#39;t survive being fragmented like that right now. I believe there should be a single, trusted chain that the developers commit to upgrading, exchanges commit to supporting, and smart contract systems can support to be compatible with other systems.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have Bitcoin devs claiming this or that potential exploit, can we dismiss 100% of that criticism as being rooted in bile?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think we can, actually. I haven&#39;t seen any practical systemic attack to be worried about (delaying finality, censoring transactions, confirming invalid transactions), and I also haven&#39;t seen any evidence of critical bugs aside from the clock sync bug that was found in testnet, which I admit was a rather big bug but was a very unique, one-off case that didn&#39;t threaten the safety of the network, just the liveness. My question is if Bitcoin devs have exploits for Ethereum&#39;s PoS, why aren&#39;t they publishing them? Why aren&#39;t they using them to crash the beacon chain to spin a narrative around Bitcoin maximalism? They could say that they&#39;re waiting for the PoS merge to unleash them, but the longer PoS runs flawlessly, the more I seriously doubt that the Bitcoin maxis have discovered exploits that top auditing firms plus hundreds of top security researchers worldwide have missed.</p>\n\n<p>I would gladly discuss any attack with a bitcoin maxi in detail. I&#39;m not afraid of getting technical and down to the level of code.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An open source project that aims to upend the financial world uses a centralized (git is decentralized, github is most emphatically not) source code repository that just happens to be run by a company that makes its money primarily by selling proprietary software.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because Git is decentralized, the dev team could pick up and move providers at a moment&#39;s notice, so the centralization isn&#39;t as much an issue. Say tomorrow Microsoft does something questionable, the devs could move the code trivially to Bitbucket, Gitlab or other provider (or even start emailing git patches to each other) by changing a setting in their Git clients. It might take a day or two to migrate the discussions and issues. Then they keep chugging along.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, GitHub has almost zero vendor lock in for a code-only project like Ethereum.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I should think it obvious what the concerns are: at a minimum you likely know the whereabouts of the many contributors throughout the day</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Microsoft definitely knows the IP address and thus the general whereabouts of Ethereum contributors at the moment they browse GitHub or push code, but likely so does Google, and Apple, and cell phone providers and governments. We lost our location privacy as a species long ago. You have to just assume that as long as your cell phone is powered on, some government system somewhere is probably logging your position. So I would say it&#39;s a threat that&#39;s not unique to Microsoft.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>you know who is slacking</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyone can look at the public commit history and tell who&#39;s slacking ;) No special privileges required.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>you are probably able to affect the workstations used in some nefarious fashion</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Very unlikely. This would require a zero-day exploit in the Git protocol itself or a web browser, both of which are some of the most widely-used and highly-audited types of software in the world.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>even the code itself? (an actor with access to Microsoft&#39;s resources could own SHA-1 if it wanted)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While this may be true, the attack would be plainly visible as it would cause discrepancies in developers&#39; local code repos, and likely cause their git clients to throw duplicate/conflicting object errors which would be investigated quickly. Then Microsoft would have to come up with a very elaborate story to cover their ass and not hemorrhage corporate customers due to such a preventable, obvious, widely studied and inexcusable security breach.</p>\n\n<p>On another note, while collision attacks are viable on SHA-1 nowadays, I am pretty sure that preimage attacks are still not viable. That&#39;s the type of attack that could potentially have bearing on the security of a git project given an attacker outside the dev team.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is also the question of, who is accessing the source code? ... What kinds of exploits can somebody with backdoor access to github achieve by contacting parties interested in the code out-of-band?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hopefully everyone! All source code for Ethereum&#39;s Layer 1 is public as far as I know. Perhaps counterintuitively, sharing your code publicly generally leads to <em>less</em> exploits than closed-source code. This pattern is often touted by open-source proponents.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We&#39;ve got miners apparently making threats of performing the unsupported fork; Microsoft or its assignees knows more about who these people are than the Foundation; would coordination with these miners somehow profit some group within? How is this not a problem?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t think of any specific attack that GitHub could make against the Ethereum developers that (1) the developers could not easily detect, (2) the developers could not trivially move to a different git provider to avoid, and (3) wouldn&#39;t put Microsoft in massive hot water with their large corporate and government customers. But if there is a specific class of attack, I would be curious to hear it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Microsoft&#39;s CEO looked the OSS community in the eye after the Github announcement and proclaimed that they were &quot;all-in on open source.&quot; Does that sound like a true statement to you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a developer, it does, honestly. I can&#39;t remember the last time a company purchased a developer tool and actively made it so much better to use. New CI/CD tools and hosted runners, Codespaces, the Arctic code vault, dependabot alerts, as a dev, GitHub is more of a joy to use for writing open source than it&#39;s ever been.</p>\n\n<p>As a counterpoint you have Stack Overflow which has been slowly alienating its developer community over the same timeline in the name of short term profits and corporate bs. Microsoft really does care about the devs that use GitHub, at least in the sense that they are looking 10-20 years ahead to tastefully extract profit from a bustling open source community, rather than trying to squeeze their users today to pump their quarterlies.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>we&#39;re letting them host Ethereum clients?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The binaries are authenticated via PGP, so Microsoft is only a bandwidth provider. Data integrity is verified by a separate un-forgeable signature.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes. We lose the miners. They&#39;re gone. There&#39;s no rolling back. I use all kinds of software and I accept updates largely on the premise that if I don&#39;t like what it does I can roll back. None of these OSs or applications are as important to me as Ethereum is, and yet this ends up being the sole software product I don&#39;t get to benefit from rolling back?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think there&#39;s a false equivalency comparing a software upgrade to a software <em>protocol</em> upgrade. With software, everyone can for the most part use whatever version they like. With a protocol, everyone communicating has to use the same version of the protocol or they can&#39;t communicate with each other. This is why Ethereum protocol upgrade hard forks happen in lockstep. At a specific predetermined block number all clients start using the new protocol suddenly, dropping the old protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Because the Ethereum protocol is itself a consensus protocol, having multiple versions running at the same time necessarily means having two separate forks of the chain, but you get that!</p>\n\n<p>This is comment 1/2, since I&#39;ve run up against the 10,000 character limit.

Dismissed as Bitcoin FUD and while I can usually tell the difference, here it's a question of blockchain-as-understood-by-international-lawyers/criminals.  I don't put stock in it but I can't shoot it down either.  It's not whether it's true or not it's that it's clearly an uncertainty.\n\nPossibly less about the consensus mechanism and more about whether they grandfather in existing coins, and only subject new coins to parts of all of a new regime?  Is 2 a new coin?  So then I'm, I don't know anymore what side I'm arguing for, because if it is and they grandfather, we would clearly not want to fork so as to enjoy any vested privilege.  And if they don't?  Again isn't not so much as yes or no but that we don't know?\n\nGiven such uncertainty, wouldn't the wisest course be to not do anything destructive?  Wouldn't we want to have a PoW fork going simply on account of it being the least destructive option?\n\nIt's destructive deprecating the miners.  Keeping them around as a contingency simply makes sense, maybe not from a development perspective, I'm not based in the code but this isn't about the code, this is basic strategy.  If you're a General fighting a war sending home one of your armies home as you march your other into a potential ambush is not good strategy.  You resolve the uncertainty first.\n\nIf it complicates the code, so be it, yes easy to say, but strategically it just has to be worth it.  I mean, the frustrating thing to me is to not get a good answer as to why we can't do this.  Ether survives the fork just as it does in any other fork, it's off-chain assets that half to be split in two.  Is that it?\n\nSo all values identified as representative of a off-chain asset after block #XYZ are thereafter to be interpreted as exactly half of what they are.\n\nIs that it?

The miners are being sent home.  No more Ethereum for you!\n\nAnd then what, act surprised if/when they do the fork?\n\nWouldn't this simply be a courtesy?  I'm not a miner, honest; I like Ralph Kramden quotes, a favorite is about being nice to people on the way up because you might meet the same people on the way down, burning bridges can be as devastating as it is easy.\n\nDid the uncertainty point survive?\n\nIt could easily be a question of whether the Ethereum ecosystem can survive at all.\n\nYou know, when we talk about support, the bare minimum necessary is to simply acknowledge the off-chain asset.  Maybe it is so that the PoW chain sees the price fall, but that doesn't affect the asset.  Most here will probably end up using a centralized exchange to transfer that asset from/to PoW/PoS.  Drama complete.\n\n> My question is if Bitcoin devs have exploits for Ethereum's PoS, why aren't they publishing them? Why aren't they using them to crash the beacon chain to spin a narrative around Bitcoin maximalism? They could say that they're waiting for the PoS merge to unleash them, but the longer PoS runs flawlessly, the more I seriously doubt that the Bitcoin maxis have discovered exploits that top auditing firms plus hundreds of top security researchers worldwide have missed.\n\nNeeds mo money.  Shouldn't that be the assumption?  Is the bile real?  Is the bile real?  If it is, why would you expect them to do you the favor of attacking the chain when you most want them to?\n\n> but the longer PoS runs flawlessly, the more I seriously doubt that the Bitcoin maxis have discovered exploits\n\nAnd that should be the recruitment line to talk people who have assets in both PoW/PoS into moving them over to PoS.\n\n> Say tomorrow Microsoft does something questionable\n\nAgain would this be assuming they would do you the favor of not waiting for exactly the worst moment to do this?\n\n> the devs could move the code trivially to Bitbucket, Gitlab or other provider (or even start emailing git patches to each other) by changing a setting in their Git clients\n\nBut of course that's after whatever is that they did and I mean, that's just an enormous surface area of fail.  I invoke Snowden.  This is Microsoft ffs.  Called them a vendor of proprietary software is what I did but should have gone on to talk about the client list, with just today the big contract with the U.S. military.\n\nThis isn't even close.  Of course the tools are going to be brilliant.  The tools you use.  And the tools the guys on the other side of that connection are using.\n\n> Microsoft definitely knows the IP address and...\n\nYeah yeah yeah yeah.  Snowden.  Not taking precautions?  I'm not a priest.  This is just obviously being gamed.  You probably think I'm trolling you.  You can bloody be sure I think you're all trolling me.\n\n(all, like OSS) \n\n> Anyone can look at the public commit history and tell who's slacking ;) \n\nAgain, since the threat would be a well-timed one, it isn't things like the number of commits but being able to determine that Alice just took a coffee break or Bob went to the john.\n\n> Very unlikely. This would require a zero-day exploit in the Git protocol itself or a web browser, both of which are some of the most widely-used and highly-audited types of software in the world.\n\nWho maintains the database of exploits at Microsoft?  I think I know who does at Google.  Centralized exploit delivery service is what it should be called.  Bob comes back from the john and intercepts the latest and greatest and hands if off to Eve.\n\n> On another note, while collision attacks are viable on SHA-1 nowadays, I am pretty sure that preimage attacks are still not viable. That's the type of attack that could potentially have bearing on the security of a git project\n\nI imagine in this totally Snowden-approved (or should be) scenario the network is stressed in some way necessary to cause the developers to reach out to Github and do the patch magic.  And the exploit then be waiting and nobody's auditing anything and the devs are _trusting_ Microsoft at that moment to do the right thing.\n\n> Perhaps counterintuitively, sharing your code publicly generally leads to less exploits than closed-source code.\n\nNo that's not my point.  It is not just that the code is being downloaded but the other activity.  How seriously?  You could just grab the code but there's other stuff, all of which can be logged, all of which can be analyzed.\n\nIs the ability to affect the likelihood of a fork a valuable thing for somebody to do?  If there's value in that, in some I'm sure convoluted manner, then you can be sure that at that level, the tools have been rendered that allow them to extract it.\n\nAgain this is Ethereum, this isn't any of this other stuff.  This isn't a typical example of OSS.  Github is fine I'm sure for any of this other stuff.  Somebody would obviously love to game this and in any way they can.\n\n> I can't think of any specific attack that GitHub could make against the Ethereum developers that (1) the developers could not easily detect, (2) the developers could not trivially move to a different git provider to avoid, and (3) wouldn't put Microsoft in massive hot water with their large corporate and government customers.\n\nYou can't think of any but they can.  And look at all of these assumptions.  That it wouldn't be at the behest of their large corporate and government customers!  That detection is possible per interaction.  And again that the attack advertises itself and they didn't science the shit out of it.\n\n\"All of the git tools for this work great!\" should be my line, not yours. \n\n> As a developer, it does, honestly. I can't remember the last time a company purchased a developer tool and actively made it so much better to use.

If these features you're talking about right now aren't available native on Linux or via some other provider then that doesn't appear to be so.\n\nI'm just saying that exercising the same discipline with the development tools as is done with the protocol is just good strategy.  Sending your troops swords off to Alice's Sword Repair Shop (yes, we've rolled over back to Alice) when Alice may be a sympathizer is not good strategy.\n\nLet me eply to your protocol points after a meal or maybe tomorrow.

Otherwise there wouldn't have been plans to implement eWASM in the past.\n\nI just read the Enjin blogpost and it basically boils down to fees and transaction times. A parachain can do 700-1k TPS.

There are areas where the two diverge and attempt to solve different problems. There are also areas of significant overlap. One of these areas is the virtual machine. WASM as a technology is significantly more powerful than the EVM. It is my opinion that we need to make improvements (such as building an EVM compatibility layer on top of WASM - eWASM) and that the engineering required to do so will take years. Enjin certainly won&#39;t be the last to try different networks to solve their problem and it could be incredibly damaging for Ethereum if we get stuck with this legacy VM due to not starting that work when it became apparent it was required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ethereum devs know this.
