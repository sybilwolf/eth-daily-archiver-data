Flow built a L1 chain for NFTs, but centralized their validation to get the scalability. Similarly, Polkadot parachains (and Avalanche multi-chains) were to enable custom L1s, while again centralizing validation and with a potentially high auction cost for a parachain. ImmutableX is out-scaling both those options, while also not materially compromising on security and decentralization like Polkadot and Flow do.

It's pretty obvious now that ImmutableX is going to be the de-facto standard venue for NFT activity going forward.\n\nThe user experience is incredible. You go from a maximum of 5 TPS for NFT trades on L1 to potentially 9,600 TPS (though more complex exchanges will be lower, but still thousands).

You'll recall this is a significant advantage of ZK rollups over optimistic rollups, which take 7 days, and can't be worked around for non-fungible assets with liquidity bridges etc. Of course, there will be a gas cost to L1 entry and exit, but I expect exchanges to support ImmutableX natively shortly.\n\nCheck out Loopring, dYdX and DeverseFi for a similar user experience for fungible assets.\n\nPS: Some further thoughts: \n\nI'll note that projects like Connext and Hop are already working on better L1 <> L2 and L2 <> L2 inter-operability. \n\nTheir \"carbon-neutral\" branding is pretty clever.

I&#39;m quite confident we&#39;ll hit at least $5k this cycle, so I don&#39;t have any sell plans before then.  At that point it depends on what sentiment looks like - if it&#39;s mid summer and we&#39;re still just trickling upwards then I&#39;ll probably just sit and wait, but if it&#39;s late in the year and we&#39;ve hit something that looks like mania I plan to start phasing out.  Current estimates are ~25% at 5k, ~50% at 10k, rest at 15k if we get there, but again, playing it by ear and adjusting based on what sentiment and price action looks like at the time.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-01 09:21:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gt1njl4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mho0ic","parent_id":"t1_gt1lty2","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/LLupine","body":"Definitely not selling at 2k.

Sounds like they are basically taking Eth&#39;s EVM and porting it onto a sidechain for BCH, and are claiming it can handle a much higher TPS somehow (1 billion gas every 15 seconds?). For example, they are saying the Uniswap contract will be working on it as soon as this weekend (though I&#39;m assuming this must be some kind of testnet, it didn&#39;t sound like the side chain was fully launched yet, and I&#39;m not sure what they would even swap there since there aren&#39;t any tokens yet I know of).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone think this will be a legit competitor for Ethereum if it can launch by the end of the year? My first impression is if Eth is already on POS and has scaling from layer 2s by the time this is ready, then it shouldn&#39;t take too much away from Eth and may just be the preferred DeFi universe for BCH holders. If it launches before then with better scaling it would concern me though.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/mhwrdg/smartbch_is_a_ethereum_virtual_machine_web3/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/mhwrdg/smartbch_is_a_ethereum_virtual_machine_web3/</a> - post from Roger Ver with more details on the project.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-01 14:35:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gt2snop","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mho0ic","parent_id":"t3_mho0ic","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"It's going to be super centralized with something like 1 billion gas per 15 seconds.
