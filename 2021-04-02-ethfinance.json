I hope you don't mind. It's about ImmutableX, which is launching publicly next week.\n\nIt's not just a Layer 2 NFT marketplace, but rather a ZK rollup built specifically for NFT applications. It offers greater scalability (up to 10,000 TPS) than any L1 chain, all the while being secured by Ethereum mainnet. This is it - the blockchain trilemma effectively conquered. Flow built a L1 chain for NFTs, but centralized their validation to get the scalability. Similarly, Polkadot parachains (and Avalanche multi-chains) were to enable custom L1s, while again centralizing validation and with a potentially high auction cost for a parachain. ImmutableX is out-scaling both those options, while also not materially compromising on security and decentralization like Polkadot and Flow do. This is why I think Polkadot's model is DOA and why L1 chains have no real future aside from creating strong network effects in certain niches (like Flow is doing) or becoming an Ethereum rollup.\n\nLaunching with Gods Unchained, but soon available for all developers building NFT-related smart contracts. They have been announcing a new partner everyday, including the biggest NFT exchange there is - OpenSea. It's pretty obvious now that ImmutableX is going to be the de-facto standard venue for NFT activity going forward.\n\nThe user experience is incredible. You go from a maximum of 5 TPS for NFT trades on L1 to potentially 9,600 TPS (though more complex exchanges will be lower, but still thousands). What costed $40 on L1 suddenly costs only $0.003 in gas, and is effectively gas-free abstracted away from the end-user. Finally, transactions are confirmed instantly, another significant UX improvement. Overall, the experience is now essentially perfect.\n\nEntries from and exit to L1 is potentially within a mainnet block, or at most within a few minutes, whenever ImmutableX publishes the next state transition to L1. If ImmutableX is as popular as I suspect, there'll be one every block, so entry/exit times of 12 seconds. You'll recall this is a significant advantage of ZK rollups over optimistic rollups, which take 7 days, and can't be worked around for non-fungible assets with liquidity bridges etc. Of course, there will be a gas cost to L1 entry and exit, but I expect exchanges to support ImmutableX natively shortly.\n\nCheck out Loopring, dYdX and DeverseFi for a similar user experience for fungible assets.\n\nPS: Some further thoughts:\n\nI'll note that projects like Connext and Hop are already working on better L1 <> L2 and L2 <> L2 inter-operability.\n\nTheir \"carbon-neutral\" branding is pretty clever. Along with decreasing gas costs by 10,000+ times, it also reduces carbon footprint by a similar amount. We all know NFTs are going mainstream, but the carbon footprint, high transaction fees, and clunky user experience have been three of the chief complains - all solved by ImmutableX. Of course, there's still a large crowd that don't yet see the advantages of a smart contract over having third-party agents, lawyers, brokers and paper contracts, so that will take time. But when they do, there'll be all the scalability we need for the world's NFT usage. Not to mention, with data sharding coming in late 2022 / early 2023, this will go up to 200,000+ TPS. At that point, it can support mainstream games like Fortnite.\n\nSlight inaccuracy above: there's one L1 chain today that can potentially exceed ImmutableX's throughput - Solana. But it costs $1,500/month to run, increasing by $500 every couple of months. It's as centralized as blockchains can get.\n\nFinal clarification: I believe for the initial launch, you don't have complex smart contract functionality, but rather basic NFT-related transactions like minting, exchange etc. That should cover most bases though, and I'm sure they're going to continue developing the platform.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is the first time I&#39;m reposting a comment from the prior daily, but I think this is too important to go unnoticed for the wider NFT and Ethereum ecosystem.

IMO we should be testing that and breaking out, leading to a ~100% increase (like, ratio ~0.07). This is <em>easily</em> justified by the success of Ethereum. If BTC remained around it&#39;s current value then ETH = $4k seems like <em>a minimum</em> price, not even accounting for EIP-1559 and successful move to PoS. IMO, if EIP-1559 is successful and progress towards PoS continues at pace, there will be no explanation for such a low ratio to continue apart from either inexplicably ignorant or absurdly fraudulent markets.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-02 18:39:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gt7bk2x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_midbun","parent_id":"t3_midbun","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/twobadkidsin412","body":"Yes I will take another hit of this hopium","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes I will take another hit of this hopium</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-02 19:20:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gt7fs0z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_midbun","parent_id":"t1_gt7bk2x","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/tutamtumikia","body":"I think inexplicable ignorance is a super easy explanation if you follow this space.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think inexplicable ignorance is a super easy explanation if you follow this space.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-02 20:58:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gt7p52u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_midbun","parent_id":"t1_gt7bk2x","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-01 23:29:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gt48pzu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_midbun","parent_id":"t3_midbun","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/piisai","body":"2 bucks now!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>2 bucks now!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-01 23:51:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gt4a30d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_midbun","parent_id":"t1_gt48pzu","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Funny how BTC briefly cracking the 60k \nmark last night made headlines around the world yet ETH briefly cracking 2k again...

I do think (hope) that we have a good amount of room to run up before that, especially if btc doesn\u2019t fuck it up for us.  But I have some laddered limit sells starting around 2100, some of my stack I\u2019ve been holding for quite some time and it feels good to stick to a plan and pull out a small amount of profits.  I\u2019ll be keeping in 65% or so of my total holdings regardless, but nothing wrong with people having a plan to take some profits, whether to spend it on something or with the intent to buy back in at a lower usd price if that\u2019s what you see happening.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-02 10:18:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gt5r0jd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_midbun","parent_id":"t1_gt5mv73","score":-3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stevieraykatz","body":"Dawg have you been paying attention for the last month?
