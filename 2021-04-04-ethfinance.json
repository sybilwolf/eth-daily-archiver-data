It's one of the reasons that we explicitly decided to not create yet another ERC-20 as a unit of exchange for VCs to snap up (we'll just use ETH thank you).\n\nNFT's recent meteoric rise in popularity was a surprise, but our April release target was set well in advance of the start of it. Would it hurt if some of that hype carries over into interest in Influence? Of course not, but it wasn't the goal. We're also ensuring that earlier adopters are getting aggressive bonuses, because we get that it's a leap of faith. While given the background of the literally hundreds of projects abandoned post-2018, it may be hard to take my word, I will tell you that this is a 10-year vision finally coming to fruition, and I have \\*absolutely\\* no intention of abandoning it, no matter if 1 asteroid is sold, or 250,000.\n\nIf you want to delay, I respect that of course.
