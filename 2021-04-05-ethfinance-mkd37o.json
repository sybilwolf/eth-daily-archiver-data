Easiest example is price - miners worry about short term prices, investors long term value, and devs might not care about price at all beyond security. Users might be a \"flip of the switch\" - don't care about price until gas prices go up since they just buy what they need when they need it - since they are just trading ERC tokens, yield farming, ect.\n\nNow apply that to something like EIP-1559.

Too high funding means long is an overcrowded trade, and thus there's strong future selling pressure when spot rises. Because positive funding is what % longs owe to shorts, high positive funding means there's immiment selling pressure (within 8 hrs) for longs to close their position as keeping it open starts to get expensive. For example, in a 20x long with 1 ETH margin, your notional is 20 ETH. A sustained funding of 1.8% is 5.4% daily (it's never this high for this long tho). It costs you 1.08 ETH a day to keep your 20 ETH position open, which wipes out your margin and forces you to close. \n\nI'm asking if there's been precedent where high funding rates can be sustainable to an ATH run, or does it always lead to a purge of longs.

This is needed since perpetual futures essentially roll over every 8 hours forever, unlike traditional futures which have a definite expiration. </p>\n\n<p>Positive funding means the market is going long, neutral funding means there&#39;s an equal number of shorts/longs and negative funding means the market is going short. Too high funding means long is an overcrowded trade, and thus there&#39;s strong future selling pressure when spot rises. Because positive funding is what % longs owe to shorts, high positive funding means there&#39;s immiment selling pressure (within 8 hrs) for longs to close their position as keeping it open starts to get expensive. For example, in a 20x long with 1 ETH margin, your notional is 20 ETH. A sustained funding of 1.8% is 5.4% daily (it&#39;s never this high for this long tho). It costs you 1.08 ETH a day to keep your 20 ETH position open, which wipes out your margin and forces you to close. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m asking if there&#39;s been precedent where high funding rates can be sustainable to an ATH run, or does it always lead to a purge of longs. If there&#39;s strong spot demand, I&#39;m inclined to say it&#39;s possible but since I&#39;ve only recently kept track of this, I&#39;m not sure.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-05 20:03:30","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-04-05 20:10:03","id":"gtj2qss","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mkd37o","parent_id":"t1_gtj0zci","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/tech_consultant","body":"I've been a bit quiet the last few days as I'm trying to reduce my phone based Reddit consumption. \n\nTo the moon, comrades.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been a bit quiet the last few days as I&#39;m trying to reduce my phone based Reddit consumption. </p>\n\n<p>To the moon, comrades.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-05 20:32:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtj5un8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mkd37o","parent_id":"t3_mkd37o","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/reuptaken","body":"FEI out of peg: let's punish MKR!\n\nThat's how it works.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>FEI out of peg: let&#39;s punish MKR!</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s how it works.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-05 02:13:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtfouto","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mkd37o","parent_id":"t3_mkd37o","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-05 02:48:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtfqyr4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mkd37o","parent_id":"t1_gtfouto","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/consideritwon","body":"Is maker still partially relying on usdc for backing?

The basic idea is rather than specifying a strategy using a set of discrete events (limit orders) they specify their strategy using a function (e.g. x*y=k). What Kyber means by their \"framework catered to professional market makers\" is just customized functions per participant rather than one function to rule them all like Uniswap v2, Bancor, Balancer, etc. The touted advantages are identical to Uniswap v3, it's just that Kyber had a whitelisted system for who could participate as a federated price reserve and they didn't have a clean UI for it. Their DMM does a few things but at its heart the AMM portion of it is just what Uniswap v3 does but worse. Their one parameter is the amplification factor which determines the steepness and bounds of the bonding curve. This is potentially going to create a UI mess with a bunch of different pools created at different strike prices for each individuals position. Compare this to Univ3 where there is 1 pool for each pair but each person has their individual position. Personally I feel Uniswap v3 is going to eat their lunch on this aspect. They have the bigger name, the trust that comes with it, and the way they do it is more gas efficient. Too little too late as it were. If this was launched in April 2020 then this had some potential. Instead they spent their developer hours on being able to vote on 3 system parameters and watched Uniswap gain all the market share from every food token because Uniswap offered fungible LP tokens that could be staked for liquidity farming.\n\nHowever, their DMM does offer one novel thing worth mentioning: Dynamic Fees. Basically the idea is that they dynamically adjust the fee rate based on the volatility of the pair. It's not explained clearly to me how they are calculating price volatility or the effect on volume this will have. Generally fees are optimized when you maximize volume * fee rate. If the pair is moving a lot and you're using an AMM then there is a lot of volume. Are you better off in that situation increasing the fee rate and driving that volume elsewhere? Is the multiple higher? I'd need to see some actual proof of that claim. If they were calculating the spread of price across other exchanges for the fee rate then I could believe they were attempting to protect LP's from arbitrage bots eating all the profit, but they aren't.\n\nAdditionally let's do a PE calculation real quick. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/kju63a/daily_general_discussion_december_25_2020/ggyvcnk/) the long form calculation summary.\n\nCurrent parameters:\n\n0.1%, Burn: 5.77%, Reward: 62.75%, Rebate: 31.48%\n\nLast quarter volume: Jan 858M, Feb 554M, Mar 330M. Q1 volume: 1.742B. Total fees: 1.742M Projected annual fees: 6.968M. Let's call it 7M.\n\nBenefit to KNC stakers are 7M(total fees)\\*0.0577(burn rate) + 7M(total fees)\\*0.6276(staking rewards)\\*3.35(1/KNC staking ratio)=15.12M\n\nMarket Cap: 688M\n\nPE: 45.53\n\nSo the PE has gone from 15 in December to 45 now. I converted a good amount of my position to BNT in early February which definitely worked out. Then I upsized considerably from cash reserves to farm XTK at the start of March. Now I'm up almost 100% on my principal from farming XTK but given all I see here I'm considering moving my farming position to Aave instead of KNC.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Having a look at <a href=\"https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-dmm-beta-is-live-b6bdd18d0dde\">Kyber&#39;s new DMM</a></p>\n\n<p>To some extent Kyber has always done what Uniswap 3 is trying to do with each provider specifying their own liquidity curve.
