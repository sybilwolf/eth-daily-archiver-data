Firstly, an announcement - the kind folks at Ethstaker.cc have offered this post a home! [Check this link](https://ethstaker.cc/category/ethosphere/) if you want to bookmark the timeline and always reference the latest version. I also can expand the post there as am not limited to 10k charas. That being said, I'll keep posting abridged here in r/ethfinance because why not?\n\nI feel that this week seemed relatively quiet compared to last week with what seemed like every project in the L2 space giving insane roadmap updates, both positive and negative. We have some changes/confirmations this week though:\n\nProtocol upgrades - The first of these, Berlin, upcoming on April 14th or 15th depending on your timezone, is on Rinkby testnet and still on track to go live according to [this week\u2019s All Core Devs call](https://youtu.be/V-Qz4UN6Z88). There is a Cat Herders [viewing party](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-countdown-community-call-ffa51239c148) for those interested in watching it live with the various EIP authors, as well as a POAP-inclusive [Ethstaker viewing party too.](https://ethstaker.cc/berlin-hardfork-party/)\n\nAfter that on the Eth1 side we still have the London upgrade scheduled for July. This has EIP-1559 of course and the good news here is that Besu, Geth and Nethermind are already syncing on testnet. The general dev consensus is that London is in a very good place this early on in the timeline. Definitely on track, integration testnet (named Aleut) [spec exists](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/client-integration-testnets/aleut.md).\n\nAfter London will be Shanghai. The consideration at the moment is twofold\u2026 1- should The Merge go into Shanghai, and 2 - if so, what does that mean for other EIPs in the backlog? If the intent is to deliver \u2018minimum viable Merge\u2019 that implies that other EIPs may not get delivered for quite some time (possibly 1 year+). Does that make sense? So there is a big discussion happening at the moment on what, if any, additional EIPs should be being considered for London, Shanghai, and the subsequent upgrade. I\u2019d recommend checking out [the ACD call](https://youtu.be/V-Qz4UN6Z88) for the detail there, or follow [Tim Beiko on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1377980135484260352) u/DCinvestor has also [been posting](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mho0ic/daily_general_discussion_april_1_2021/gt1lasq/) on this topic seeking community views.\n\nWhile this discussion progresses, efforts on The Merge are accelerating. [Work towards a locked down spec](https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/ethereum_consensus_upgrade_mainnet_perspective) is going well. Community comms efforts [have started](https://ethmerge.com/). Everybody seems now to want to get it done - but not at the expense of 1559, mind you. Dev consensus seems to be that Merge efforts are in a good place, particularly after the first of the new bi-weekly [Merge dev calls.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3hfgLa_GHw) The only concerns are around client team resource - there is a lot of work compounding, particularly if decisions are taken to load up London and Shanghai with other EIPs. This is very \u2018watch this space\u2019. The roadmap will be highly enlightened once the [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/) hackathon at ETHglobal has taken place April/May. This is where the Eth1 and 2 client teams will be attempting to hack together a testnet Merge and Sharding with rollups if all goes well.

Firstly, an announcement - the kind folks at Ethstaker.cc have offered this post a home! <a href=\"https://ethstaker.cc/category/ethosphere/\">Check this link</a> if you want to bookmark the timeline and always reference the latest version. I also can expand the post there as am not limited to 10k charas. That being said, I&#39;ll keep posting abridged here in <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a> because why not?</p>\n\n<p>I feel that this week seemed relatively quiet compared to last week with what seemed like every project in the L2 space giving insane roadmap updates, both positive and negative. We have some changes/confirmations this week though:</p>\n\n<p>Protocol upgrades - The first of these, Berlin, upcoming on April 14th or 15th depending on your timezone, is on Rinkby testnet and still on track to go live according to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/V-Qz4UN6Z88\">this week\u2019s All Core Devs call</a>. There is a Cat Herders <a href=\"https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-countdown-community-call-ffa51239c148\">viewing party</a> for those interested in watching it live with the various EIP authors, as well as a POAP-inclusive <a href=\"https://ethstaker.cc/berlin-hardfork-party/\">Ethstaker viewing party too.</a></p>\n\n<p>After that on the Eth1 side we still have the London upgrade scheduled for July. This has EIP-1559 of course and the good news here is that Besu, Geth and Nethermind are already syncing on testnet. The general dev consensus is that London is in a very good place this early on in the timeline. Definitely on track, integration testnet (named Aleut) <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/client-integration-testnets/aleut.md\">spec exists</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After London will be Shanghai. The consideration at the moment is twofold\u2026 1- should The Merge go into Shanghai, and 2 - if so, what does that mean for other EIPs in the backlog? If the intent is to deliver \u2018minimum viable Merge\u2019 that implies that other EIPs may not get delivered for quite some time (possibly 1 year+). Does that make sense? So there is a big discussion happening at the moment on what, if any, additional EIPs should be being considered for London, Shanghai, and the subsequent upgrade. I\u2019d recommend checking out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/V-Qz4UN6Z88\">the ACD call</a> for the detail there, or follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1377980135484260352\">Tim Beiko on Twitter.</a> <a href=\"/u/DCinvestor\">u/DCinvestor</a> has also <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mho0ic/daily_general_discussion_april_1_2021/gt1lasq/\">been posting</a> on this topic seeking community views.</p>\n\n<p>While this discussion progresses, efforts on The Merge are accelerating. <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/ethereum_consensus_upgrade_mainnet_perspective\">Work towards a locked down spec</a> is going well. Community comms efforts <a href=\"https://ethmerge.com/\">have started</a>. Everybody seems now to want to get it done - but not at the expense of 1559, mind you. Dev consensus seems to be that Merge efforts are in a good place, particularly after the first of the new bi-weekly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3hfgLa_GHw\">Merge dev calls.</a> The only concerns are around client team resource - there is a lot of work compounding, particularly if decisions are taken to load up London and Shanghai with other EIPs. This is very \u2018watch this space\u2019. The roadmap will be highly enlightened once the <a href=\"https://rayonism.io/\">Rayonism</a> hackathon at ETHglobal has taken place April/May. This is where the Eth1 and 2 client teams will be attempting to hack together a testnet Merge and Sharding with rollups if all goes well. Exciting stuff.</p>\n\n<p>In other updates:</p>\n\n<p>~ Coinbase stock listing <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/coinbase-is-said-to-plan-its-direct-listing-in-two-weeks\">now has a date\u2026 14th April</a>, same day as Berlin!

I think I\u2019ll still ride it out a bit and I remain unemotional but shit, not easy to hit your marks. Probably done after this little test trial of trading. TLDR: Trade at your own peril.

So, if you are putting a substantial amount in, you\u2019re probably still ok in a return vs. fee perspective, but if you\u2019re just looking to dip your toes in, be wary.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-06 12:46:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtluh3w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ml40yc","parent_id":"t1_gtltlol","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Audy922","body":"Thanks.
