Until recently, most people thought (and still think) that almost all fees would be burned, but this won\u2018t be the case.\u00a0\nThat is because gas does not equal gas. The existence of markets on top of Ethereum (such as exchanges, lending protocols, etc.) creates a constant stream of financial arbitrage opportunities. These opportunities, e.g. to arbitrage the price between two Defi exchanges or between one Defi and one Cefi exchange, to liquidate borrowers or margin traders, and so on, have tremendous financial value. But they can only be performed by the first trader who gets them mined on the blockchain.\nThat is why the first 10-20 transactions in every block tend to pay disproportionate amounts of transaction fees \u2013 much more than is necessary to get included in the block. They do this because they must be early in the block to complete their trade. Miners currently benefit tremendously from these transactions, many of them without even knowing about it.\u00a0\nThis revenue would be unaffected in EIP-1559, because it would be paid via the tip, not the basefee, and hence isn\u2019t burned. Georgios and I\u00a0have recently quantified the importance of these \u201cpriority transactions\u201d relative to normal transactions, and made a surprising discovery.\nDepending on how much MEV is correctly classified by our data source, we can see that miners are likely making more money from selling priority gas today than from selling regular gas.

Until recently, most people thought (and still think) that almost all fees would be burned, but this won\u2018t be the case.\u00a0\nThat is because gas does not equal gas. The existence of markets on top of Ethereum (such as exchanges, lending protocols, etc.) creates a constant stream of financial arbitrage opportunities. These opportunities, e.g. to arbitrage the price between two Defi exchanges or between one Defi and one Cefi exchange, to liquidate borrowers or margin traders, and so on, have tremendous financial value. But they can only be performed by the first trader who gets them mined on the blockchain.\nThat is why the first 10-20 transactions in every block tend to pay disproportionate amounts of transaction fees \u2013 much more than is necessary to get included in the block. They do this because they must be early in the block to complete their trade. Miners currently benefit tremendously from these transactions, many of them without even knowing about it.\u00a0\nThis revenue would be unaffected in EIP-1559, because it would be paid via the tip, not the basefee, and hence isn\u2019t burned.

Do other wallets, that are compatible with DEX, charge extra fees too?</p>\n\n<p>And with ETH 2 happening this/next year, what would be the incentives for not simply holding ETH since it&#39;s gonna be ultra-sound money? Is it using the ecosystem cause fees would be low so still worth to do swaps, being involved into projects, etcetera?</p>\n\n<p>Also, most of my stack is still in the orange coin and, unfortunately, can&#39;t swap that to ETH since it&#39;s gonna trigger taxes :( I can see ETH pushing for x10 of the current price sometime this cycle (what is a cycle for ETH lol) but if bitcoin peaks at x5 of the current price that means that ETH can at least x5 * x4 (to even out the market cap). Hopefully I&#39;d get to cash out my grandpa coin in the summer/fall and then get some of that ETH during some quick downside, beginning of the next bear market (which might be shorter or non-existent for ETH again) or before merge happens.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-07 22:59:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gts2gay","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t3_mmkgdz","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/stripedredwallpaper","body":"Ethereum","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-07 22:00:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtrxvbx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t3_mmkgdz","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CantBelieveIGotThis","body":"jk","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>jk</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-07 23:27:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gts4gtt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t1_gtrxvbx","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/usswsbregrets","body":"Looks like I shouldn\u2019t have sold all my 1inch","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Looks like I shouldn\u2019t have sold all my 1inch</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-08 00:18:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gts7zcd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t3_mmkgdz","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/crypto_lad","body":"I have 2 and a half inches here that I can give you?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have 2 and a half inches here that I can give you?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-08 01:42:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtsdn2o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t1_gts7zcd","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Childsp","body":"Quit bragging.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Quit bragging.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-08 06:05:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtt0trn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t1_gtsdn2o","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Screw those binance shit chain traitors!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Screw those binance shit chain traitors!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-08 01:24:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtscc29","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t1_gts7zcd","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Who\u2019d have thought you\u2019d have so much success as a prostitute!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Who\u2019d have thought you\u2019d have so much success as a prostitute!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-08 00:21:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gts85tt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t1_gts7zcd","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/headwar","body":"Why pump?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Why pump?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-08 02:55:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtsipcn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t1_gts7zcd","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/usswsbregrets","body":"GDAX listing","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>GDAX listing</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-08 02:56:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtsiqsz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mmkgdz","parent_id":"t1_gtsipcn","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/accountaccumulator","body":"In case someone is interested in building for Lido, they have just started a developer/contributor programme.
