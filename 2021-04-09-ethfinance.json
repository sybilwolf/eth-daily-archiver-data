But doge is pretty cheap right now and it may hit $1.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s amazing how they speak with so much confidence about investing and crypto.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-09 17:56:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtzuhxe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mna0c6","parent_id":"t1_gtzlcdp","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hereimalive","body":"Still regret selling my 3 million DOGE for $1000.\n\nI mined those.
