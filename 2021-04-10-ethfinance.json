Reminder: the latest version of the timeline can always be found [here](https://ethstaker.cc/category/ethosphere/) but will always post to the r/ethfinance daily because, as u/superphiz notes, [the best place to find out about what's going on in Ethereum at any given moment is this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mmkgdz/daily_general_discussion_april_8_2021/gtv3r9j/).\n\nThis week it felt like certain pieces were moving into place - we have some big projects either launching, or preparing to, all the while the Ethereum core protocol upgrades continue to make good progress. Clearly next week is a big one for milestones.\n\n~ First up this week is Rocketpool. The final beta is still ongoing, as are its security audits. Lots of speculation this week about when Rocketpool will finally launch as it originally had ambitions to do so in Q1. [This estimate](https://discord.com/channels/405159462932971535/405163713063288832/829020202778886206) is the best going right now, which would indicate mid-May. Also RPL community member hanniabu has made a [fun tool](https://www.rocketpooltool.com/) which attempts to predict how much your prospective Rocketpool node might return to you in rewards. The results are\u2026 compelling! I believe the tool is not fully fleshed out so salt grains are required.\n\n~ The [Immutable X Marketplace](https://market.x.immutable.com/) went live this week for Gods Unchained. [Here\u2019s what you can do on it right now.](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/04/07/immutable-x-marketplace-early-access/) These are [the first stages](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/03/04/immutable-x-gu-rollout/) of what will become a full, open NFT protocol once the concept is proven with GU. Cracking start though with [$400k in fees saved on day 1 alone](https://cryptobriefing.com/no-fee-nfts-save-immutable-x-users-400k-24-hours/).\n\n~ Defi platform dYdX was one of the early milestones [tracked in this timeline](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lv1lh6/daily_general_discussion_march_1_2021/gpb8i27/), and indeed they released their L2 closed alpha back in February. Very happy to report that [dYdX L2 launched on mainnet this week](https://dydx.exchange/blog/public). Looking forward to seeing them grow via handy tools like [L2Beat!](https://www.l2beat.com/)\n\n~ On the Ethereum protocol side of things we had the [Eth2 devs call this week.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLB5HEWdZUE) The main update for this timeline is that work continues towards both The Merge (see below) and the Altair upgrade this summer. Prior to Altair launch, the Nimbus team is flagging 2 months lead time for security audits. Danny Ryan thinks June is optimistic at this point. As such, I wouldn\u2019t call it a delay necessarily, given no firm commitments have been made, but this likely pushes the upgrade into Q3 (July) on the timeline. Client teams are making good progress though. [Dev call notes](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/SkiD8Y3rd) if you\u2019d like the detail.\n\n~ After last week\u2019s new [Merge dev call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3hfgLa_GHw&t=531s), and the announcement of the [Rayonism hackathon](https://rayonism.io/), work on the Merge is still in full swing. The hardworking client teams are supporting this at the same time as progressing Altair (for Eth2 clients) and London (for Eth1 clients) in parallel. If you want to learn about The Merge, check out [https://ethmerge.com/](https://ethmerge.com/). You can even contribute to the content there by [submitting a PR to the repo](https://github.com/InsideTheSim/ethmerge.com-content) just like helpful individuals Justin Drake and u/vbuterin have already done.\n\n~ And finally, for the London upgrade, the first EIP-1559 transaction [successfully ran this week](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1380530805169123339) on the Aleut devnet. #itshappening.gif!\n\nSee you all next week after a successful [Berlin launch](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-countdown-community-call-ffa51239c148) ([ethstaker launch party!](https://ethstaker.cc/berlin-upgrade-party/)), Coinbase [stock listing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/coinbase-is-said-to-plan-its-direct-listing-in-two-weeks), and [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/) kick-off!\n\n\u2014\n\n**THE TIMELINE**\n\nAll dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.\n\n**Done/In Progress**\n\n* ~~18 March - [Rocketpool final beta](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-3-0-beta-finale-fb35c4f8e003).~~ In progress.\n\n* ~~24 March - Eth1 Berlin upgrade on Rinkby testnet.
