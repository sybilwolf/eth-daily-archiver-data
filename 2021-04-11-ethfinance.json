It&#39;s irrelevant what flawed arguments maxis make about ETH. The reality is that the price of ETH is critical to the security model, just as is the price of BTC. The price of BNB has nothing to do with security.

I've seen some people here who don't see any value in Bitcoin, so thought I'd point out some. We all know money is a fictional human construct, so it's all about psychological stability, confidence and maturity of an asset. Bitcoin is far ahead on that front for various reasons we've all heard about, while Ethereum still has many high-risk protocol upgrades coming up. However, Ethereum is also making some calculated compromises with decentralization:\n\n\\- Ethereum's state is growing much faster than Bitcoin, even at current gas limits, so it's certainly harder to run an Ethereum node.\n\n\\- Presumably as a result, Ethereum's reliance on Infura is definitely more than any single service provider for Bitcoin.\n\n\\- Running a full node is difficult enough, but with weak subjectivity in beacon chain it becomes essentially impossible to sync a full node from genesis, so a trust assumption is introduced here with nodes being synced from snapshots.\n\n\\- Further, with statelessness, proposers still have to run a full node, which becomes very expensive with blown out gas limits. Of course, validators, services, and users will be able to run stateless clients. Sharding also introduces some complexity, as do rollups.\n\nEthereum's multi-client approach does make it more decentralized and anti-fragile than Bitcoin's single client, even though it has been thoroughly battle-tested. Overall, yes, Bitcoin does take the more purely decentralized approach. Are Ethereum's minor trade-offs worth it? I definitely think so (no need for a rebuttal on the above points, I'm well aware!), and it is what enables/will enable rich decentralized applications to run at scale. However, I think it's pretty clear that as a special-purpose blockchain, Bitcoin will remain the de-facto standard pristine store-of-value for the foreseeable future. Doesn't mean ETH won't flip BTC, though - in traditional finance the derivatives markets are at least twice as large as the actual collateral.\n\nOn the flipside, we have the centralized knock-off. As much as I despise Binance, the cold hard reality is that they offer much of the entire Ethereum experience at a fraction of the cost, and they have an order of magnitude more money than the Ethereum Foundation to push the narratives aggressively. This has proven to be a winning strategy, at least in the short term. There are also promising, well-implemented, well-networked and well-funded semi-decentralized projects like Polkadot that'll be here to stay by fulfilling niches that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum do. I do think a vast majority of L1s are irrelevant, though, with rollups offering better functionality, scalability, security, decentralization and network effects than most L1s.\n\nIn short, I see a world where Bitcoin and Ethereum will thrive together, both complementing each other. Bitcoin is worth a lot more with Ethereum's DeFi protocols; likewise, Ethereum is worth a lot more with Bitcoin's pristine collateral on DeFi protocols. There's no argument for maximalism - this industry will grow faster when we work together.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Kudos to <a href=\"/u/arthurtest\">u/arthurtest</a> for running <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/moo5z5/ethereum_maximalism_is_barely_distinguishable/\">an intriguing experiment</a>.

However, Ethereum is also making some calculated compromises with decentralization:</p>\n\n<p>- Ethereum&#39;s state is growing much faster than Bitcoin, even at current gas limits, so it&#39;s certainly harder to run an Ethereum node.</p>\n\n<p>- Presumably as a result, Ethereum&#39;s reliance on Infura is definitely more than any single service provider for Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>- Running a full node is difficult enough, but with weak subjectivity in beacon chain it becomes essentially impossible to sync a full node from genesis, so a trust assumption is introduced here with nodes being synced from snapshots.</p>\n\n<p>- Further, with statelessness, proposers still have to run a full node, which becomes very expensive with blown out gas limits. Of course, validators, services, and users will be able to run stateless clients. Sharding also introduces some complexity, as do rollups.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum&#39;s multi-client approach does make it more decentralized and anti-fragile than Bitcoin&#39;s single client, even though it has been thoroughly battle-tested. Overall, yes, Bitcoin does take the more purely decentralized approach. Are Ethereum&#39;s minor trade-offs worth it? I definitely think so (no need for a rebuttal on the above points, I&#39;m well aware!), and it is what enables/will enable rich decentralized applications to run at scale. However, I think it&#39;s pretty clear that as a special-purpose blockchain, Bitcoin will remain the de-facto standard pristine store-of-value for the foreseeable future. Doesn&#39;t mean ETH won&#39;t flip BTC, though - in traditional finance the derivatives markets are at least twice as large as the actual collateral.</p>\n\n<p>On the flipside, we have the centralized knock-off. As much as I despise Binance, the cold hard reality is that they offer much of the entire Ethereum experience at a fraction of the cost, and they have an order of magnitude more money than the Ethereum Foundation to push the narratives aggressively. This has proven to be a winning strategy, at least in the short term. There are also promising, well-implemented, well-networked and well-funded semi-decentralized projects like Polkadot that&#39;ll be here to stay by fulfilling niches that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum do. I do think a vast majority of L1s are irrelevant, though, with rollups offering better functionality, scalability, security, decentralization and network effects than most L1s.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I see a world where Bitcoin and Ethereum will thrive together, both complementing each other. Bitcoin is worth a lot more with Ethereum&#39;s DeFi protocols; likewise, Ethereum is worth a lot more with Bitcoin&#39;s pristine collateral on DeFi protocols. There&#39;s no argument for maximalism - this industry will grow faster when we work together.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-11 08:09:30","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-04-11 08:23:25","id":"gu5h21j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mokpzr","parent_id":"t3_mokpzr","score":30,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-11 08:57:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gu5mq5b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mokpzr","parent_id":"t1_gu5h21j","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/243576809","body":"I'm not sure Bitcoin is around in 5-10 years unless it makes significant changes.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m not sure Bitcoin is around in 5-10 years unless it makes significant changes.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-11 09:16:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gu5p538","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mokpzr","parent_id":"t1_gu5mq5b","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Bitcoin the network may very well die in the long term.
