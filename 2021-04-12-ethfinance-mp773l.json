There were multiple forks and faketoshis trying to capitalize on the ez pz open source copy pasta free coins (sounds familiar?).</p>\n\n<p>2021 ETH is pretty similar. It had only 1 previous bull run to show for, and now it had to consolidate its position as the top dog of smart contracts. There are multiple pretenders and forks and copy paste projects trying to &#39;kill it&#39;. Based on the fundamentals, I think this year will be the &#39;last&#39; hard battle ETH has to fight. The next bull run, I imagine, ETH will be in a very established and comfortable throne alongside BTC, backed by institutional trust. On the other side, ADA, DOT and BNB will have to fight for the top 10 spots.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-12 05:33:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gu8x7ub","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mp773l","parent_id":"t3_mp773l","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BakedEnt","body":"BTC maxis must be celebrating that our focus shifted from trying to flip BTC to \"defending\" against centralised copycats and vaporware ETH killers.

My reasoning is two fold:\n\n 1. it's pretty clear that the internet is absolutely essential to maintain our global supply chains, banking infrastructure, and communications networks. Even in a global power outage, satellite internet still provides a means to keep the network going where local power banks can maintain the infrastructure, and thus it's likely blockchains will continue as long as theirs sufficient hash power. So I think the internet infrastructure is actually very resilient, and thus so is crypto.\n \n 2. In the event of hyperinflation, goods and services will be much more valuable than fiat currency. Any digital finance networks based on fiat will be affected by this. So that means getting food and services will go back to bartering, however bitcoin and ethereum provide an alternative means of accounting, and thus the utility of a cryptocurrency will revert back to the essentials, a unit of account and a store of value.\n\n Why ETH instead of BTC? Because if we have a financial collapse, it's easier to rebuild a novel global financial network on Ethereum. Also, in the likely scenario where fiat just keeps going and hyperinflation never happens, Ethereum is still a better bet than Bitcoin.\n\n So all in all, I'm still bullish on crypto, and Ethereum in particular.

My reasoning is two fold:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>it&#39;s pretty clear that the internet is absolutely essential to maintain our global supply chains, banking infrastructure, and communications networks. Even in a global power outage, satellite internet still provides a means to keep the network going where local power banks can maintain the infrastructure, and thus it&#39;s likely blockchains will continue as long as theirs sufficient hash power. So I think the internet infrastructure is actually very resilient, and thus so is crypto.</p></li>\n<li><p>In the event of hyperinflation, goods and services will be much more valuable than fiat currency. Any digital finance networks based on fiat will be affected by this. So that means getting food and services will go back to bartering, however bitcoin and ethereum provide an alternative means of accounting, and thus the utility of a cryptocurrency will revert back to the essentials, a unit of account and a store of value.</p>\n\n<p>Why ETH instead of BTC? Because if we have a financial collapse, it&#39;s easier to rebuild a novel global financial network on Ethereum. Also, in the likely scenario where fiat just keeps going and hyperinflation never happens, Ethereum is still a better bet than Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>So all in all, I&#39;m still bullish on crypto, and Ethereum in particular.

On the other hand you&#39;re getting a high APY because you&#39;re one of the few betters against something which is likely to happen (like ETH 5K in 2021) or for something that is very unlikely to happen (like ETH 100K in 2021). As you have the option to change your options weekly (the reasons why fees will be low as long as it is on L1 is that all changes will be made weekly at once and the fees will be shared on the call makers) you may be able to get very high APYs for short amounts of time.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this more or less correct, as it is how I understand it.
