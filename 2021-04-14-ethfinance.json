I've been pumping this Berlin Upgrade call by EthStaker, but there's more to it. Poap.art will be launching during the call, and call participants will receive a POAP that will serve as an entry token into https://poap.art. From there, they'll have the duration of the call to paint one pixel per second on a 128x128 collaborative canvas. At the conclusion, that canvas will be minted as an NFT.. the first NFT minted by the poap.art platform. It has the potential to be kind of a big deal, and I imagine something Ethfinanciers would like to stamp with their seal. My job is to encourage a bunch of communities to participate in this, so I can't help you organize, but you need a fearless leader who can put a team of clickers together along with a pixel-art roadmap to draw on this canvas. It could be a big long-term payout for Ethfinance and the only cost is missing one measly night of sleep (and potentially getting fired from your job, but that's not my problem, you were going to be watching COIN anyway). Anyway, I hope someone steps up and makes this a mission for the day.

It&#39;s much easier to catch a price close to the ATH on the way down than on the way up.  Last cycle it took ONE month for the ATH to go from $500 to $1400, and <em>FIVE months</em> for it to finally drop back below $500 for the last time (until this bull run of course).  Looking in closer, it took <em>8 days</em> to go from $900 to $1400, and then a month and a half to drop back below it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-14 20:46:10","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-04-14 20:52:02","id":"gukh711","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mqjl8a","parent_id":"t1_gukgebj","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/beermango","body":"This is the kind of hopium I guess I was reaching out for, and I think deep down I feel the same way.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is the kind of hopium I guess I was reaching out for, and I think deep down I feel the same way.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-14 20:50:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gukho1v","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mqjl8a","parent_id":"t1_gukh711","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/happychillmoremusic","body":"If it goes to 10k I\u2019m going to just have to figure out how to have sex with myself","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If it goes to 10k I\u2019m going to just have to figure out how to have sex with myself</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-14 21:13:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gukjras","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mqjl8a","parent_id":"t1_gukh711","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/ThreePoundUni","body":"I\u2019m debating this.

More often than not I have lost small amounts of money on them.. These pools are \"dangerous\" for new (to crypto) people, as Impermanent Loss is not a concept most people fully understand..\n\nBigger amounts:\n\nWhen I plan to hold the token for the long term, I use Bancor. After providing liquidity for more than 100 days, you get 100% Impermanent Loss protection.\n\nBancor is great, if you have some coin/token that you want to: a) yield farm but also protect from Impermanent Loss, b) hold for a long period of time, c) use to earn a high yield & pool trading fees.\n\nIn my opinion, 10k is the logical minimum investment, considering the high entry tx fees. The project will soon (no date) move to L2 (Arbitrum). This will most probably fix the high fee problem.\n\nOK.. Keep in mind the following:\n\na) If you enter a 'protected' Bancor pool, you need to stay inside for at least 100 days if you want to be 100% protected from Impermanent Loss. Actually, the initial protection begins after 30 days (30%) and increases by 1% up to day 100...\n\nb) If you enter a 'protected' Bancor pool, WITH rewards, the percentages advertised, only fully apply if you keep your funds into the pool for at least 4 weeks. Providing liquidity for a shorter time period (than 4 weeks) earns you fewer rewards (lower reward multiplier), and of course, leaves you open to IL (see point a).\n\nc) The rewards are paid in the Bancor native token, BNT (not in the token you provide for liquidity).\n\n\nMy own personal experience with Bancor is positive. They have paid the rewards they were advertising and with each passing day that my liquidity stayed in their pool, the IL decreased slightly. After 100 days, I got full IL protection..\n\nThe Bankless guys did a good job of explaining the above, in the following article:\n\n[https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-protect-yourself-from-impermanent](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-protect-yourself-from-impermanent)\n\nPS: their Discord is an AMAZING place to get all your questions answered.

After providing liquidity for more than 100 days, you get 100% Impermanent Loss protection.</p>\n\n<p>Bancor is great, if you have some coin/token that you want to: a) yield farm but also protect from Impermanent Loss, b) hold for a long period of time, c) use to earn a high yield &amp; pool trading fees.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, 10k is the logical minimum investment, considering the high entry tx fees. The project will soon (no date) move to L2 (Arbitrum). This will most probably fix the high fee problem.</p>\n\n<p>OK.. Keep in mind the following:</p>\n\n<p>a) If you enter a &#39;protected&#39; Bancor pool, you need to stay inside for at least 100 days if you want to be 100% protected from Impermanent Loss. Actually, the initial protection begins after 30 days (30%) and increases by 1% up to day 100...</p>\n\n<p>b) If you enter a &#39;protected&#39; Bancor pool, WITH rewards, the percentages advertised, only fully apply if you keep your funds into the pool for at least 4 weeks. Providing liquidity for a shorter time period (than 4 weeks) earns you fewer rewards (lower reward multiplier), and of course, leaves you open to IL (see point a).</p>\n\n<p>c) The rewards are paid in the Bancor native token, BNT (not in the token you provide for liquidity).</p>\n\n<p>My own personal experience with Bancor is positive. They have paid the rewards they were advertising and with each passing day that my liquidity stayed in their pool, the IL decreased slightly. After 100 days, I got full IL protection..</p>\n\n<p>The Bankless guys did a good job of explaining the above, in the following article:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-protect-yourself-from-impermanent\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-protect-yourself-from-impermanent</a></p>\n\n<p>PS: their Discord is an AMAZING place to get all your questions answered.
