The biggest ones sometimes never retrace. Examples for ETH include the move from $1 to $6 and the move from $13 to $80. I believe we&#39;re due for a similar move from $180 to $1000+. If you endured the last two years building an ETH stack during the bear market, congratulations. If you swooped in during the recent panic with liquid capital, and snatched up some cheap ETH, my hat&#39;s off to you. If you&#39;re in either category, you&#39;ve already won; all you have to do is decide on some firm sell targets and be patient...

Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. <strong>The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions</strong>, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. -Satoshi Nakamoto</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When will BTC Maxis come around and accept that Bitcoin has failed its vision?
