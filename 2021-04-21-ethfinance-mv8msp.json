I&#39;m not going to get any more money by pointing out how dumb you are for not wanting to invest Ethereum or that the project you prefer is shit. The industry will evolve and the best project will be the best.</p>\n\n<p>We may have market share but so did Yahoo, MySpace, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Be humble but do not keep your head under ground, be aware of what&#39;s going on and never ever be a fucking cunt to whoever thinks differently than you.</p>\n\n<p>You think Ethereum is good and the best? So do I, now shut the fuck up and be nice to people around you.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-21 13:40:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gvd8ckl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mv8msp","parent_id":"t1_gvd6thq","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Most of us are just tired of being told we're wrong for a decade.

Anyway, I'll just post it here so it's not lost:\n\nWe've all seen the \"high fees = platform is dying\" populist narrative time and time again, but it never seemed to make any sense from a basic microeconomics perspective. What is really happening is that there's overwhelming demand with limited supply, leading to high prices. Fortunately, finally we now have a control (Ethereum) and a variable (BS Chain) to analyze some real data. Before you downvote away, let me just make it very clear that BS Chain is centralized trash, but most retail in the space are only looking to make a quick buck and couldn't care less about decentralization - and BS Chain is the right product at the right time. 20th April was a particularly busy day. Of course, I should be looking at a moving average, but I find the data from yesterday fascinating. Here's what the two platforms did:\n\nBS Chain consumed 1.2T gas, 15x more than Ethereum at 81M. As a result, BS Chain's state grew by a whopping 5.5 GB in a single day! At this rate of growth, and if they keep bumping up gas limits, it'll surpass Ethereum's 6-year state by next month (despite only a couple of months of any real activity), and grow to several TBs by summer. In a couple of years, we'll be looking at 10 TB+. So, clearly, this level of scalability on L1 is very, very expensive, and completely rules out decentralization or trustlessness in any form.\n\nWhat about revenues, though? Despite Ethereum's state only growing 6% BS Chain's, its revenues in tx fees were $49 million, compared to $4.6 million for BS Chain.\n\nWhat does this mean? I'm not an economist, so please take my opinion with a bag of salt. But here are my takeaways:\n\n\\- Ethereum blockspace is a premium service with a premium price tag. Currently, it costs 180x higher to use Ethereum than BS Chain, but people are more than wiling to pay, and its supply is totally maxed out. BS Chain is the cheap knock-off, but people are unwilling to pay more than 0.5% the price to pay it, and it too is supply constrained. They cannot keep increasing gas limits forever, even if they are centralized.\n\n\\- There's an overwhelming demand for EVM blockchain space. No matter what Ethereum does, L1 gas will remain high forever as higher gas limits will be easily saturated. Even if 64 shards were executing, it wouldn't take long till we're back to square one. Vitalik may have massively underestimated how popular Ethereum would be.\n\n\\- Like with all products, there is a correct equilibrium for maximizing revenues - if supply starts exceeding demand, revenues will start to decrease significantly even if many more transactions are being made. Case in point: BS Chain. So, contrary to popular belief, **if Ethereum were to blow up gas limits up to 100M and gas prices plummet to 10 gwei, it's actually bearish for ETH** with overall tx fee revenues declining, especially with fee burns incoming. Validators/miners are incentivized to find the right balance to maximize revenues, and they will be keeping L1 blockspace at a premium. This also makes it more secure. This is not a discussion that'll happen till after statelessness and sharding execution, though, as Ethereum blockspace will continue to be supply-constrained for the next few years.\n\n\\- All that said, rollups with data sharding are the only solution currently to offer enough supply for global demand while also being decentralized.

Anyway, I&#39;ll just post it here so it&#39;s not lost:</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve all seen the &quot;high fees = platform is dying&quot; populist narrative time and time again, but it never seemed to make any sense from a basic microeconomics perspective. What is really happening is that there&#39;s overwhelming demand with limited supply, leading to high prices. Fortunately, finally we now have a control (Ethereum) and a variable (BS Chain) to analyze some real data. Before you downvote away, let me just make it very clear that BS Chain is centralized trash, but most retail in the space are only looking to make a quick buck and couldn&#39;t care less about decentralization - and BS Chain is the right product at the right time. 20th April was a particularly busy day. Of course, I should be looking at a moving average, but I find the data from yesterday fascinating. Here&#39;s what the two platforms did:</p>\n\n<p>BS Chain consumed 1.2T gas, 15x more than Ethereum at 81M. As a result, BS Chain&#39;s state grew by a whopping 5.5 GB in a single day! At this rate of growth, and if they keep bumping up gas limits, it&#39;ll surpass Ethereum&#39;s 6-year state by next month (despite only a couple of months of any real activity), and grow to several TBs by summer. In a couple of years, we&#39;ll be looking at 10 TB+. So, clearly, this level of scalability on L1 is very, very expensive, and completely rules out decentralization or trustlessness in any form.</p>\n\n<p>What about revenues, though? Despite Ethereum&#39;s state only growing 6% BS Chain&#39;s, its revenues in tx fees were $49 million, compared to $4.6 million for BS Chain.</p>\n\n<p>What does this mean? I&#39;m not an economist, so please take my opinion with a bag of salt. But here are my takeaways:</p>\n\n<p>- Ethereum blockspace is a premium service with a premium price tag. Currently, it costs 180x higher to use Ethereum than BS Chain, but people are more than wiling to pay, and its supply is totally maxed out. BS Chain is the cheap knock-off, but people are unwilling to pay more than 0.5% the price to pay it, and it too is supply constrained. They cannot keep increasing gas limits forever, even if they are centralized.</p>\n\n<p>- There&#39;s an overwhelming demand for EVM blockchain space. No matter what Ethereum does, L1 gas will remain high forever as higher gas limits will be easily saturated. Even if 64 shards were executing, it wouldn&#39;t take long till we&#39;re back to square one. Vitalik may have massively underestimated how popular Ethereum would be.</p>\n\n<p>- Like with all products, there is a correct equilibrium for maximizing revenues - if supply starts exceeding demand, revenues will start to decrease significantly even if many more transactions are being made. Case in point: BS Chain. So, contrary to popular belief, <strong>if Ethereum were to blow up gas limits up to 100M and gas prices plummet to 10 gwei, it&#39;s actually bearish for ETH</strong> with overall tx fee revenues declining, especially with fee burns incoming. Validators/miners are incentivized to find the right balance to maximize revenues, and they will be keeping L1 blockspace at a premium. This also makes it more secure. This is not a discussion that&#39;ll happen till after statelessness and sharding execution, though, as Ethereum blockspace will continue to be supply-constrained for the next few years.</p>\n\n<p>- All that said, rollups with data sharding are the only solution currently to offer enough supply for global demand while also being decentralized. But even that may not be enough long term, which is why tech like zkPorter and Validium will play an important role. Eventually, I see multi-layered scalability, with various hybrid layers with different magnitudes of decentralization/centralization. We see this already with Visa being a centralized scalability solution for Ethereum. Perhaps they&#39;ll settle with a rollup eventually, which would make it a dual-layer solution with a centralized layer on top of a decentralized layer 2, on top of Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it this way: there are multiple usecases for blockchain smart contracts, each with different levels of value and security requirements.
