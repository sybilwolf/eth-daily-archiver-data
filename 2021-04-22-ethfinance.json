ETH has truly been life changing.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/ETHfinance\">/r/ETHfinance</a> it&#39;s not a goodbye, but rather a see you later!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-22 11:15:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gvh0yn1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mvxoow","parent_id":"t3_mvxoow","score":59,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/originalbaconslab","body":"Good job.

Right now ETH is $2622 and BTC is $54907, so ETH/BTC is 0.04775.</p>\n\n<p>The reason it&#39;s important is because crypto is highly volatile.  If you just look at ETH/USD you don&#39;t know if any price action is just ETH moving by itself, or if it&#39;s the entire crypto sphere moving together.  The ETH/BTC ratio will tell you which one it is.  If the ratio is holding steady, then any price changes you see are just the entire crypto market inflating or deflating with market sentiment.  If the ratio starts rising, it means there&#39;s something <em>particular to ETH</em> that&#39;s outperforming the rest of the market.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-22 09:47:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gvgo8ml","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mvxoow","parent_id":"t1_gvgmqjg","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"To expand on that, 0.177 is known as The Flippening; when eth market cap is equal to bitcoin's.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To expand on that, 0.177 is known as The Flippening; when eth market cap is equal to bitcoin&#39;s.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-22 09:59:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gvgpw9r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mvxoow","parent_id":"t1_gvgo8ml","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/suicidaleggroll","body":"That's where it was last cycle, but ETH's supply has increased since then.

So to transfer a token from Alice to Bob one must submit a transaction to a contract on L1, which hold all the records of ownership. Now if you are moving your tokens to L2 then token ownership needs to be given to the address of the L2 contract and then the L2 contract makes a record inside of itself of how much you own of X. Right so far? Then the thing is that the L2 contract needs to support all ERC20 tokens. I notice that at this point ZkSync says they are whitelisting tokens manually at the moment, so I assume that's what they are talking about? So technically L2 (Plasma, optimistic rollups and zk-rollups) is in a way a big wrapper around the state of ERC20 contracts on L1 as far as L1-L2 interoperability is concerned (or ERC721, depending on the usecase). Except that for optimistic rollups at the moment the full state of a contract gets written onto L1 and not just token values, which zkRollups are not doing yet.\n\nAm I understanding this correctly?\n\nEDIT: What the hell Matic (Polygon), xDAI and all those do I don't even have the basic idea.

The underlying tokens will also be used to vote on protocol governance and most xTokens have several variants with different mandates that dictate how they'd vote.\n\nUltimately it boils down to you only having to pay for 2 on chain transactions, one to enter the xToken and one to leave when you eventually decide to do that. But you get all rewards as if you were actively staking and compounding your tokens weekly (very expensive for BNT). All this while being able to show your governance preferences, which again usually cost on-chain transactions.  \n\nThere is also the benefit that doing it this way could be considered far more tax beneficial\\*. You'd only pay gains on the difference in price of the xToken from when you entered to when you exited.
