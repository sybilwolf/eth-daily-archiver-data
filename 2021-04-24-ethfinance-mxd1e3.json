Honestly, this surprises be because, for all the excitement around the technology, I can't for the life of me figure out why the vast majority of people don't at minimum view it the same way they view buying a stock.  But they just don't.  \n\nThis puts the idea of $10k ETH really into perspective in my opinion.  Traditional stocks 4x all the time over a period of years, even when the company is a known commodity.  \n\nI like to compare ETH to Facebook because in 2013, FB was clearly the dominant social media platform in all kinds of metrics like total users and daily active users.  Like, everybody was well aware of the network effect FB had achieved.  But the stock was $27.  The basic reasoning was that there were up-and-coming competitors that had slick platforms (but far fewer users) and there were questions of whether Facebook could effectively monetize it's platform/users profitably.

Honestly, this surprises be because, for all the excitement around the technology, I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out why the vast majority of people don&#39;t at minimum view it the same way they view buying a stock.  But they just don&#39;t.  </p>\n\n<p>This puts the idea of $10k ETH really into perspective in my opinion.  Traditional stocks 4x all the time over a period of years, even when the company is a known commodity.  </p>\n\n<p>I like to compare ETH to Facebook because in 2013, FB was clearly the dominant social media platform in all kinds of metrics like total users and daily active users.  Like, everybody was well aware of the network effect FB had achieved.  But the stock was $27.  The basic reasoning was that there were up-and-coming competitors that had slick platforms (but far fewer users) and there were questions of whether Facebook could effectively monetize it&#39;s platform/users profitably.

Downvote away! \n\nEveryone knows the blockchain trilemma and compromises involved. Cardano's consensus layer is pretty unique in the space - it seems to be the worst of all worlds. It is definitely more decentralized than most DPoS-like chains, but by doing so it's not scalable. While other chains simply have hard validator limits and no delegation limits to deliver higher throughput, Cardano has a bizarre combination of having a delegation saturation which was intended to limit centralization. It has obviously failed completely, with Binance running dozens, if not hundreds of validators (or what they call stake pools). This design means Cardano can have more validators than any DPoS-type chain, but the flipside is it's no longer scalable. As a result, it has 20 second block times - which are longer than Ethereum's 12 seconds - and at the current block limits Ethereum has roughly 8 times higher throughput. They can of course increase their blocksize to roughly match Ethereum, but probably not do much more than that. Their state channel scaling solution is quite obsolete in a world of rollups and sharding. There's also a whole bunch of other strange decisions - such as the hard fork combinator which essentially centralizes hard fork choice, but I'll stop here. All that said, I genuinely feel there are some well-intentioned researchers and engineers, and I'm sure they'll deliver a product. It's absolutely not a scam, though CH's ridiculous shenanigans don't do the project any favours. Or maybe it's just a marketing tactic to cultivate a cult of personality and attract newbies, who knows?\n\nI was joking about the shitposting, of course, the real reason I made this comment is to highlight the remarkable beacon chain consensus mechanism which continuously goes underappreciated as \"just another PoS\".

Downvote away! </p>\n\n<p>Everyone knows the blockchain trilemma and compromises involved. Cardano&#39;s consensus layer is pretty unique in the space - it seems to be the worst of all worlds. It is definitely more decentralized than most DPoS-like chains, but by doing so it&#39;s not scalable. While other chains simply have hard validator limits and no delegation limits to deliver higher throughput, Cardano has a bizarre combination of having a delegation saturation which was intended to limit centralization. It has obviously failed completely, with Binance running dozens, if not hundreds of validators (or what they call stake pools). This design means Cardano can have more validators than any DPoS-type chain, but the flipside is it&#39;s no longer scalable. As a result, it has 20 second block times - which are longer than Ethereum&#39;s 12 seconds - and at the current block limits Ethereum has roughly 8 times higher throughput. They can of course increase their blocksize to roughly match Ethereum, but probably not do much more than that. Their state channel scaling solution is quite obsolete in a world of rollups and sharding. There&#39;s also a whole bunch of other strange decisions - such as the hard fork combinator which essentially centralizes hard fork choice, but I&#39;ll stop here. All that said, I genuinely feel there are some well-intentioned researchers and engineers, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll deliver a product. It&#39;s absolutely not a scam, though CH&#39;s ridiculous shenanigans don&#39;t do the project any favours. Or maybe it&#39;s just a marketing tactic to cultivate a cult of personality and attract newbies, who knows?</p>\n\n<p>I was joking about the shitposting, of course, the real reason I made this comment is to highlight the remarkable beacon chain consensus mechanism which continuously goes underappreciated as &quot;just another PoS&quot;.

The number one issue of LP's is impermanent loss, followed probably by capital efficiency. The former is being solved by Bancor basically by the protocol insuring your losses at the expense of their profit; Sushi solves this by paying you for your liquidity so your Sushi rewards outpace any impermanent loss.

This is... weak sauce... The other concrete thing on the roadmap is they are trying to serve as a routing layer like 1inch or Matcha. In my opinion that ship has sailed. Matcha will route to wherever gives you the best rate. We no longer need a protocol like Kyber to serve as a \"Hub of Liquidity Protocols\". Even more damning, they are just now, this month, exploring/evaluating competing L2 solutions. Not like, last August when gas was really heating up.

I normally try to resist shilling too much in here, but I am extremely excited about this one (not just now, but in general) and would like to share, so feel free to pass this by if that rubs the wrong way. The asset I am referring to here is ALCX, the gov token for Alchemix, which is at the lowest price I\u2019ve seen it at in quite some time, down almost 40% last time I checked. I\u2019m extremely bullish on Alchemix long term, and the ALCX token. Read on if you\u2019re interested in details as to why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirstly, to provide a quick refresher or intro for those who don\u2019t know much about it, Alchemix allows you to collateralize DAI and borrow up to 50 percent of *future* yield earned on your collateral. That collateral is deposited into Yearn and as it earns yield it pays off your debt for you automatically. Regardless of price swings, length of time, or rate of yield earned on your collateral,  *there is no risk of liquidation*. This is the *only* protocol I know of for which this is the case.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt first thought this may not seem that revolutionary to you, but I believe this to be a new novel primitive that many future projects will build on top of. Even without composability in mind, lets go over some cool current native use cases:\n\n* **Finance large purchases**: collateralize a large amount, say 500k, borrow half up front and finance a house or some other large purchase. Your DAI can now continue to earn yield at an extremely high rate, you don\u2019t have to worry about making monthly payments, and at the end of your maturity date you can withdraw all of your collateral \n* **Risk-free aping:** maybe you\u2019re more risk averse and aren\u2019t ready to invest in volatile alt coins or unaudited DeFi protocols, well now you can, risk free. Collateralize DAI, borrow off future yield, and ape away. Worst case scenario you lose your front loaded interest and the opportunity cost of that front loaded DAI. Even in the that case your collateral remains intact and at the end of your loans maturity date you have access to your full collateral back. \n* **Risk-free aping part 2:**: the above is even more powerful if you are considering \u201ccashing out\u201d along the way in this bull market. With Alchemix you can enjoy the upside of investing in non-stable crypto while \u201clocking in\u201d your profits from cashing out. Lock in profits, buy ETH, enjoy upside without losing your current gains. The only risk is the time value of that loan.\n* **Personal favorite use case, paying your monthly living expenses \u201cfor free\u201d:** no matter how much you collateralize, you\u2019re debt position (assuming you borrow the full 50%) is paid down at the same rate. Collateralizing 1000 and borrowing 500 will result in a loan that gets paid down at the same rate as collateralizing 1 mil and borrowing 500k. That\u2019s important for the context of this. If you borrow *less* than 50% your loan will mature at a quicker rate. So the idea here is to collateralize a large amount and borrow a small amount (equal to your monthly expenses) that gets paid off in roughly 1 month. According to recent rates and napkin math the last time I worked this out, you could borrow a little over 2% and have it mature in 1 months time. If your living expenses were 2k, you\u2019d only need around 90k of collateral. That might seem like a lot, but for something this powerful it\u2019s not. For as long as rates are high this basically enables FIRE with a much lower capital requirement. Crazy stuff \n\n&nbsp;\n\nCurrent use cases aren\u2019t the only reasons I\u2019m bullish. Here a few outside of that:\n\n* Alchemix provides some of the best rates on DAI in all of DeFi. This would take more words than I care to write to explain in depth, (I can do so if asked) but the tldr is that it\u2019s because the dollar peg of the token for which debt is denominated (alUSD) has been so strong. Due to this strength, the protocol has more funds than are needed to be able to fortify that peg, and so that excess can be (and is) reinvested to earn even more yield on your DAI in Yearn. Last I checked yield on DAI was at roughly 30%!\n\n* Alchemix currently has ~4.3% of all DAI locked in the protocol earning yield. And that\u2019s before the audit that is currently under way is complete.\n\n* Alchemix V2 will create two new vaults and mirror pairs: ETH/alETH and wBTC/alBTC. Think about this one for a second. How many people in here and elsewhere denominate their wealth in ETH and don\u2019t want to lose exposure to that? How about for BTC? Well once this is live youll be able to get front loaded yield on your ETH (or BTC) without losing exposure. This opens up a whole new set of potential use cases, among which is the ability to go long on your favorite store of value *without having to monitor the position or worry about risk of liquidation, regardless of the market condition*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow let me address the final question you\u2019re probably asking: what is the governance token used for? Currently nothing; it\u2019s a \u201cvalueless governance token\u201d, but this will not be the case in V2. In addition to the ETH and wBTC vaults V2 will add the DAO. ALCX holders will be able to stake and serve as lenders of first resort, (similar to AAVE) and be subject to slashing to provide insurance to the protocol in the case of a hack or doomsday scenario. In return for this, and for voting in governance, *they will earn revenues from the protocol\u2019s cash flows*. As I mentioned before, Alchemix already holds ~4.3% of DAI, how much cash flow will ALCX holders be able to earn when the ETH and wBTC vaults are also added? \ud83d\udc40\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo reiterate In case you missed it the first time, I am (and have been) accumulating, so I am most definitely \u201cshilling\u201d here; as always DYOR and invest accordingly. This protocol is not yet audited, and smart contract risk is *always* a thing. Before V2 there is no insurance if you lose your money using Alchemix. Having said that, I strongly believe in ALCX as a good bet to become DeFi \u201cblue chip\u201d when V2 is released and audits are compete. Given this, along with the fact that the market cap is sitting comfortably under 300m, and that the price per token is down from recently being close to 1:1 against ETH, I think this is a great opportunity to get in.
