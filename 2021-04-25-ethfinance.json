This is the weekly ETHosphere timeline update. \n\nSome big updates to the timeline this week as we had a decision-packed [All Core Devs call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9hzAYkklQM) and a series of highly informative [presentations at ETHGlobal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk39hNavhyM) all of which shed new light on things. Shoutouts to u/Liberosist who posted a really great summary of the ETHGlobal presentations from Friday up [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mxdu7b/notes_on_ethglobals_merge_summit/). If you missed it, I\u2019d also highly recommend checking out Vitalik\u2019s talk on [where Ethereum goes after the merge](https://youtu.be/Yk39hNavhyM?t=18060) - he goes deep into the merge cleanup, sharding and other future improvements. Very inspiring. \n\nLet\u2019s get into it!\n\n~ **London: the confirmed target date for London/1559 is now 14 July.** It will deployed to the testnets in June. There had been talk in previous weeks on whether or not to add extra EIPs to the scope of London but this was roundly rejected by the devs in favour of getting London out quickly. The confirmed EIPs for London are 1559, 3238 (ice age delay), 3198 (basefee opcode), and a simplified replacement for 3403 (removing gas refunds).\n\n~ The merge / Shanghai: The same \u2018get it done asap\u2019 approach is being taken for the merge. As a result, there will be a separate EIP cleanup upgrade [either before or after the merge](https://youtu.be/Yk39hNavhyM?t=16255), depending on how well work on the merge goes, but **at this point in time the aim is to deliver the merge in October.** On the one hand this feels ambitious, but the overwhelmingly positive updates from Rayonism are making me feel that it could actually happen. So Shanghai is officially a separate upgrade vs the merge. EIPs being discussed for Shanghai include 3074, 3521, 2935, 2537, and 2677 but this is TBC. Reminder: Ethereum Cat Herders [community call on 3074](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/eip-3074-community-call-ec87b66672e1) taking place on 26 April!\n\n~ Don\u2019t forget also that the  Altair Eth2 upgrade is planned to happen around the same timeframe. Viktor from Bison Trails posted [a good summary of Altair](https://bisontrails.co/eth2/012/) back in March for those interested in understanding Altair\u2019s scope. The [current update](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/rJUzAo0Id) is that **Altair testnets should be up in a couple of weeks ahead of a likely mainnet date in July** (previously June). \n\n~ After the merge/ Shanghai, will come a post-merge cleanup upgrade, which I\u2019m assuming will bear the Cancun title. In Vitalik\u2019s talk he lays out [a possible scope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk39hNavhyM):\n\n- Remove Eth1data voting (the consensus layer can read the execution layer directly at this point so the old voting mechanism is no longer needed)\n- Implement withdrawals (stakers can unlock their rewards, hooray!)\n- Move the execution layer to SSZ, retire RLP (efficiency improvement)\n- Agreement that clients shouldnt need to download the historical chain data (looking ahead to light clients)\n- Beacon state access opcodes (useful for onchain randomness, better awareness between the execution and consensus layers, and other things)\n\nSo there you have it\u2026 London and the merge becoming increasingly locked-in, and the picture immediately following becoming much clearer.\n\nIn other timeline notes:\n\n~ OpenEthereum posted [this post-mortem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18BhIEB7V_f_GkL8NZptxq-xadu5sb8QUzego8YVVMUM/edit#heading=h.nxtmf7qzhoyo) of the Berlin upgrade bug which was quickly fixed on launch day.\n\n~ Loopring [announced this really cool-sounding L2 / L1 bridge](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/ethport-loopring-l1-l2-cex-8bb83c9032e3) whereby L1 transactions can be batched up with the bulk of computations happening on the L2. This should save gas costs for those looking to interact with Loopring\u2019s zkRollup from or to another L1 app/CEX. Launching in May so added to the timeline.\n\n~ zkSync [have clarified](https://youtu.be/AbhZ6NYn82s?t=121) that their massively scalable zkPorter L2 solution will be introduced in October, after the initial release of zkSync 2 in August. Timeline adjusted.\n\n~ Still no Rocketpool confirmed launch date. Rocketpool need to to implement changes off the back of security audits so the current guestimate on Discord is June. Pushed back on the timeline from May.\n\n\u2014\n\n**THE TIMELINE**\n\nAll dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.\n\n**Q2 (Apr-Jun) 2021**\n\n* 16 April to 14 May - [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/).

After these milestones fall, sure, there are still other important upgrades coming, but with the merge coming late 2021 or early 2022, we\u2019re in really great shape considering we have 1559, our switch to POS, and useful L2s all here now or in our reasonable future. This then destroys the \u201cEthereum will never scale\u201d narrative as well at a time that ETH becomes deflationary and secured by green/more decentralized tech, while the world continues to increasingly realize that some of the things you can do with Ethereum are pretty damn useful and valuable.</p>\n\n<p>This is a pretty phenomenal place for Ethereum to be in right now. It seems like ETH is prime for two bull markets this year: one against USD and one against BTC.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-25 07:10:01","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-04-25 07:28:23","id":"gvthtzf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_my19eh","parent_id":"t1_gvtgwr0","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"Agreed.

Mainly there are two questions I wanna write about. Staking and this cycle. I think that these are things might be relevant to you guys as well since we all get similar inputs (e.g. this sub and or cryptotwitter) and thus think about similar stuff. \n\nStaking: for some time I wasnt sure If staking my ETH **now** makes sense. But I am now rather convinced it does. Why now? One tweet by Justin Drake got me thinking that staking makes a lot of sense. We are not only talking about 5-7% APY, but probably (at least for a certain time) way more. (source: https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1384124998084792324?s=20) On top I wanted to see how staking services evolve, if there are exploits etc. but it seems to be fine. E.g. Lido seems to be doing ok and apparently a lot of whales are staking with them. So if people trust them to deal with their 25k ETH my ETH dust should be fine as well :) Apart from the potential risk there are a lot of upsides. stETH will be a collateral for e.g. Maker soon and I guess more and more protocols will include it. So basically there seems to be \"only\" upside. Hasu/GaKonst even predict that a staking service like Lido and thus stETH could almost replace ETH in the longterm. (source: [https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1385640371544371201?s=20](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1385640371544371201?s=20)) This is kind of scary and I hope there wont be a monopoly, but several services to make sure theres not a \"too big to fail\" situation, but the idea remains the same if there is stETH, rETH etc. Liquid staked ETH is the future and you probably wont miss out, so Ill stake my ETH soon, even if the APY predicted by Justin Drake wont arrive soon (that will only happen with the merge --> end of 2021 earliest, some rumours talking about October).  \n\n\nThis cycle: the 4 year cycle meme is strong. There are a lot of people saying \"this time its different\". And I am stuck, somehow fomoing on ETH and fomoing on not doubling up during a potential bear market. I understand that the fundamentals are stronger, the situation is way different now than it was 4 years ago. DeFi, L2, protocols with revenue, EIP1559, a potential merge at the end of this year... The list of things that could end the 4 year cycle is (almost) endless. Especially a combination of 1559 and the merge is huge. See the 3 halvening memes (source: e.g. [https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1383435336978558985?s=20](https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1383435336978558985?s=20)). A 90% reduction in terms of sell pressure could be the game changer a super cycle needs. So my take is the following: if the merge indeed is completed in 2021 this would be huge. If BTC tops before this could have the same impact it always had. So this is about timing. Even then the 4 year cycle meme could still be too strong. We dont see a huge amount of institutional investment into ETH yet that could soften the BTC impact. My gut feeling tells me that this is a perfect example of the [IQ meme](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/035/645/cover4.jpg). 95% are overthinking and leveling themselves into holding because \"this time its different\" while 2%+2% exploit the same old cycle and get richer.  And to be honest: my FOMO will probably make me hold. Ill take some profits, but will put them into ETH and not into stable coins. btw i do believe there will be an \"alt bear market\". I am just not sure about ETH and BTC.   \nObviously non of this is investment advice, just some thoughts to see what youre thinking.

While it might be possible that some people are selling BTC and buying ETH with it, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s happening in any great numbers, and seeing as BTC has convincingly broken 50k now, they&#39;d be best to wait.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-25 15:04:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gvv4ova","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_my19eh","parent_id":"t1_gvv40p5","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/DavidLJ2000","body":"lol -- mass deleted all reddit content via https://redact.dev","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>lol -- mass deleted all reddit content via <a href=\"https://redact.dev\">https://redact.dev</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-25 15:07:05","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-08-24 12:33:35","id":"gvv4zc5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_my19eh","parent_id":"t1_gvv4ova","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"To back up my point?
