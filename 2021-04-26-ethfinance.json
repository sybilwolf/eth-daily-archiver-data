In the spirit of that here\u2019s a PE analysis for AAVE.\n\nI was able to find 3 sources of protocol revenue.\n\nThere are [origination fees](https://governance.aave.com/t/initial-discussion-2-origination-fees/654). Each loan currently incurs a 0.0000001% origination fee. That is so small as to be negligible. Suffice to say it amounts to thousands of dollars.\n\nThere are fees on [flash loans](https://docs.aave.com/faq/).\n\n> From Flash Loans, a 0.09% is collected from the loan amount, from which 70% is redirected as extra income for depositors of the protocol and 30% is split using the same 20%/80% model of the origination fee.\n\nHere\u2019s data I\u2019ve got from a [dashboard](https://duneanalytics.com/lotti/aave_6). This correlates with [aavewatch](https://aavewatch.com).\n\nCumulative fee by asset:\n\nETH: 194,850\n\nWBTC: 22,480\n\nDAI: 397,180\n\nUSDC: 185,353\n\nUSDT: 7,420\n\nTotal: 807283\n\nThe last form is the [protocol reserve factor](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters) which is part of Aave V2. Basically they siphon some percentage of the interest paid to a [collector contract](etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c). The contract itself is 160 days old and has 2.2M in assets currently. The DAO manages these funds but at some point all the protocol expenses need to be paid by this mechanism.\n\nReserve Factor Accrued (data from aavewatch):\n\nAsset|Reserve Factor|Reserve Factor Accrued\n:--|:--|:--\nDAI|10%|284,629\nTUSD|10%|38996\nUSDC|10%|701488\nUSDT|10%|422055\nBAT|20%|358\nBAL|20%|3565\nENJ|20%|323\nKNC|20%|18350\nLINK|20%|6677\nMANA|35%|4428\nMKR|20%|13493\nREN|20%|4366\nSNX|35%|44245\nUNI|20%|8939\nwBTC|20%|17407\nwETH|10%|58043\nxSUSHI|35%|2883\nYFI|20%|73964\nZRX|20%|25\nTotal||1,704,234\n\nThis does not perfectly line up with the amount in the collector contract and it doesn\u2019t have a time series so our options are either to say it has earned 1.7M in 160 days and extrapolate to a year or take a diff between these numbers and this [governance proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategy-for-aave-treasury/3329) someone on discord provided.\n\nOption 1: 1704236\\*365/160=3887788.38\n\nOption 2: (1704234-1569223)\\*365/27=1825148.7\n\nGiven the strong decay in Aave activity I\u2019m going with option 2 which basically indicates that the protocol revenue has more than halved since September.\nSo total revenue = 1,825,148.7 + 807,283 = 2.632M\n\nMarket Cap: 5.105B\n\nPE before expenses: **1939**\n\nThis strongly contradicts the other PE estimates I have been able to find. [Token terminal](https://terminal.tokenterminal.com/dashboard/Aave) says the PE is 34.47.I\u2019m guessing they are viewing all interest paid on Aave as the revenue but most of that obviously goes to the lenders, not to the AAVE holders so it doesn\u2019t qualify for PE. The other estimate I found was a link someone provided a few days ago here from [TheBlock](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/protocol-revenue/annualized-defi-protocols-revenue) which puts their protocol revenue at 10.02M, about 4x what I\u2019m able to account for.\n\nThis is already outrageously bad. Of course it gets worse from there though. Let\u2019s have a look at protocol expenses.\n\nThe single largest expense is the safety module (aka your profit as an AAVE staker). The stakers in the safety module (which now includes all of you AAVE farmers today) are the lenders of last resort in the event of liquidation. Basic stats from the [Aave staking page](https://app.aave.com/staking).\n\nFunds in safety module: 1,551,631,573.39\n\nMarket cap: 5,082,127,038\n\nImplied staking percent: 30.5%\n\nThis contradicts aavewatch somewhat:\n\nAAVE in safety module: 2,804,223.523\n\nTotal AAVE: 16,000,000\n\nImplied staking percent: 17.5%\n\nEither way, total protocol expenses are 1100 AAVE per day \\* 401.99 (cost per token) \\* 365 = 161,398,985\n\nBasically the system is in debt for about $158M paying for insurance on liquidations. They are currently burning through their AAVE reserves from their token launch to fund this but that is not a limitless runway. So how much would they need to have borrowed to be solvent? Well before the launch of the LM program the protocol had about 1.5B in outstanding loans. If this is generating 2.632M revenue They would need about 70x that, so around 100B in outstanding loans. So if you are one of the newfound stkAAVE holders due to their LM program, you should be aware that this system needs 158M in buy pressure to remain at its current valuation. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, you should clearly sell, not least of which because you need to sell a bunch anyway to pay off the interest on your borrows and get the yield promised you. If it makes sense for you, it makes sense for everyone else. Frontrun that alpha.\n\nIn addition to this wisdom is some timing. Expect this LM program to create a lot of buzz on social media as news of the rates propagates. With that hype expect the price to rise. YSK that the stkAAVE being earned by the LM program can\u2019t be sold immediately. The very earliest it can be sold is after a 10 day unlock period (unless there is a good liquidity pool for stkAAVE somewhere, I honestly didn\u2019t look). So maybe expect the price to rise for the next 10 days off the hype until the sell pressure hits.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Given the launch of Aave\u2019s LM program, many of you will now have a question as to whether to hold the AAVE you are earning, or whether to sell it to get the yield being promised to you.

Maybe we can escape the constant selling pressure from miners. Well, not for BTC of course, but for Ethereum.\n\nAs many of you will be aware, there are two main upgrades coming for Ethereum in the near future. First, we have EIP-1559, the fee market change which will reduce fee volatility, make for a much better user experience, reduce miners\u2019 incomes by about 30-40% (less selling pressure!) and best of all, lead to possibly millions of ETH in the form of gas fees (specifically the base fee) being burned each year. Secondly, we have the ETH 1.0 \u2014> ETH 2.0 merge where the consensus mechanism moves from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. Alongside increasing energy efficiency by over 99.9% (great for the \ud83c\udf0d and even better for public perception and marketing!) and improving security by multiple times, it will also lead to a reduction in ETH issuance, colloquially known as \u201cthe cliffening\u201d. ETH issuance will drop from about 4-5% per year which is mostly sold on the open market by miners to less than 1% ***and that 1% annual inflation is before we consider ETH burned by EIP-1559!*** Oh, but it doesn\u2019t end there, ***that 1% issuance is locked up in staking nodes and cannot be sold until sharding comes in a couple of years.***\n\nLet that sink in for a second.\n\nThe whole mechanism which causes Bitcoin to pump so hard every four years, the halvening has ***NOTHING*** on this supply shortage which is building.\n\nBitcoin pumps more than 10x because issuance dropped from 3.5% to 1.7%.

This is literally a perfect storm. Such bullish supply and demand dynamics have never existed before in human history.\n\nSo before I wrap this up, let\u2019s see how this all fits into our timeline. EIP-1559 is [set to go live on July the 14th](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-eip-1559-fee-market-154032902.html) with the London hard fork. Based on my [other post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/myq125/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2021/gvwv709/) discussing where I suspect we may be in the cycle, this could coincide with or be the launch ramp we need to go parabolic at the peak of this bull run which I think will end between August and December of this year. As for the cliffening, [the devs have been discussing the possibility of pushing this through as early as the end of 2021 but more likely early 2022](https://ethmerge.com/?q=why-is-ethereum-switching-to-proof-of-stake-pos#), right in the early bear market. By this point, the only sellers left will be weak hands. No more automatic selling from miners which historically is one of if not the the main factor in the bear market after the initial wave of whales taking profits and capitulation of weak hands in the first month or two. Meanwhile, other chains will still have positive inflation rates instead of net negative issuance. This is why once I have taken profits on 60% of my stack at the peak of this bull run the only thing I intend to hold onto is ETH (I\u2019m doing taking profits to diversify out of crypto a little like a responsible human with 30% of my stack and to buy the bear market dip with the other 30%). The remaining 40% is a forever HODL stack). No BTC. Not shitcoins. Only ETH, some profits taken into real world assets and a big stack of stablecoins in DeFi waiting to buy back some cheap ETH just before the cliffening hype kicks off.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope that [my friendship with u/CosmicCollusion](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mp773l/daily_general_discussion_april_12_2021/gu95n99/) has been re-instated and I hope you\u2019re all strapped into the ETH rocketship more than any of the other ones by the time this bear market rears its ugly head.\n\n**P.S:** Updated 2021 version of [every single reason why I am bullish on ETH](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jhrqv1/a_detailed_summary_of_every_single_reason_why_i/) coming soon.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Who wants some weapons grade hopium?

Two more weeks of sideways action have left me feeling much more confident in where I think we are at. I\u2019m getting very strong September 2017 vibes when Bitcoin went from $5,000 to $3,000 before more or less blasting off to $20K a few months later.

So to reiterate what I said last time, sorry if I sounded bearish, I just think that the 2018 bear market has given me a fear of heights and I can\u2019t help but feel like we are on the verge of leaving the stratosphere.\n\nLast time we went parabolic in 2017, BTC went from $5K to $20K. If we do that again, we\u2019ll break $200K. More realistically, due to the larget market cap, BTC may only 2-3x from here which aligns well with my long time target of about the last 1-2 years now of $95-$150K BTC. As for ETH, ETH went from $300 to $1,400 in 2017, a 4.6x return. Since ETH is smaller, I can definitely see ETH still doing a 4x from here. Especially with EIP-1559 fee burning hype to boot. Again, this lines up nicely with my 2-3 year old 2021 bull run peak price target of $10K. We may not even stop there though given that if BTC were to $150K, then the BTC:ETH ratio would be a mere 0.066. Historically low compared to ETH\u2019s peak 2017 ratio of 0.147. Personally, I can see a 0.08-0.1 ETH:BTC ratio this cycle ($12-15K ETH at a $150K BTC) and then flippening to follow in the 5 years afterwards.\n\nJust a quick note though, this could still take another 7-8 months to play out if we keep moving sideways and I do still think it is likely that Bitcoin will revisit the 20 week moving average as it liked to do so many times last bull run but hasn\u2019t done much of at all this run. This would see BTC dropping to the mid to low $40Ks. This is perfectly normal and I won\u2019t be remotely close to panicking until BTC drops below the 20 week moving average for more than a day or two or until there is a weekly close below this level.\n\nBefore I wrap up, I have one more really interesting thought I have to share with you which proves to you all that I am still an ETH perma-bull. Basically, I\u2019m starting to wonder if ETH will even see much of a bear market this time around. Yeah, you heard me right and no, I\u2019m not talking about the bullshit \u201csupercycle\u201d hopium which Bitcoin maxis like to spread.
