as long as the chain is secure, go ham and build cool shit</p>\n\n<p>So after EIP-1559 and the merge, Ethereum and Bitcoin are essentially equal in terms of future supply issuance and Store-of-Value-ness.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum had a period of higher inflation, however this allowed us to catch so many devs and users by incentivizing them to build on the chain.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is: 9-12 months from now, ETH will be just as good a store of value as BTC, in fact it will be better because even under the most conservative assumptions the net issuance will be -0.1% at a minimum, aka deflationary.</p>\n\n<p>However, Ethereum has an absolutely buzzing ecosystem of thousands of dapps and a myriad of usecases beyond just DeFi that we haven&#39;t even explored yet, all of them enabled by one fundamental property Bitcoin doesn&#39;t have: smart contracts + EVM.</p>\n\n<h1>If we take all of this into account, there is no logical reason to own Bitcoin over Ether.</h1>\n\n<p>Swap your BTC for ETH.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-27

Just like the \"airdropped\" 400 UNI was not automatically sent to everyone who was eligible, but rather, had to be manually claimed by each eligible address. (In fact [only 132 million UNI](https://duneanalytics.com/MatteoLeibowitz/uniswap-community) out of the 150 million UNI available to be claimed from the \"airdrop\" has been done so). \n\nThird, **1 billion UNI is not currently *in* circulation**. Coingecko puts that figure at [519,857,388 UNI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap). Although I'm not sure how confident to be in that number, we know definitively that hundreds of million of UNI are not in circulation. \n\nWe can go over what we know based on the [UNI announcement](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) from September 2020: \n\n* We know that a total of 400 million UNI is earmarked for the team, investors and advisors and is being released on a vested 4-year schedule. \n\n* We know that 430 million UNI is earmarked for the governance treasury. So far, governance has distributed around $1 million of UNI in two waves of the Uniswap Grants Program. (There is also a total of $1 million of UNI available for the v3 bug bounty program, but we have yet to see how much of that will actually be paid out, if any). Being generous and using a price of $30/UNI (the price on March 16, 2021 when the first Wave was announced) let's assume that 33,333 UNI (worth $1 million on March 16) has so far been given out in the UGP and thus would be able to accrue protocol fees. That still leaves ~429,966,667 UNI that is earmarked for governance and not currently in circulation. \n\n* A maximum of [5 million UNI](https://imgur.com/oFwcmpo) was earmarked for the liquidity mining program that ran for ~60 days from September to November 2020, although I'm not sure how much was actually distributed. Let's be generous and assume all 5 million UNI was distributed, that would still leave at minimum 424,966,667 UNI that is/will be vested into the hands of governance. \n\n* Also, it is important to note that the 4-year vesting schedule for the treasury, the team, advisor and investors [are exactly the same](https://imgur.com/GU7j3NR). \n\n* I also think it is highly unlikely that the community would ever allow **any** of the governance treasury UNI funds to be staked in pools to earn fees, as this would unnecessarily dilute everyone else's share of the protocol fees. \n\nSo, in closing, when trying to create a predictive UNI fee model, one should not be using a figure of 1 billion UNI for three big reasons: \n\n1.) 1 billion UNI is not currently in circulation \n\n2.) Protocol fees will almost certainly not automatically accrue to all UNI holders\n\n3.) Hundreds of millions of UNI will *never* accrue protocol fees, unless governance miraculously finds a way to spend (aka distribute) $16+ billion of UNI \n\ncc: u/Ethical-Trade ,  u/Cow_Tipping_Olympian and u/StatSticks","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Re: All the talk today about Uniswap protocol fees</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t currently have confidence (or time) to draw up an educated prediction model of potential rewards but there are few things everyone should be aware of. </p>\n\n<p>First, from the v3 announcement we know that v3 protocol fees can be turned on by governance on a per-pool basis with a range of <a href=\"https://imgur.com/wElg9MW\">10% and 25% of LP fees.</a> </p>\n\n<p>Second, I want to point out that everyone who is basing their models on 1 billion UNI is making a large miscalculation, for a few reasons, the biggest of which is <strong>fees will almost certainly not automatically accrue to all 1 billion UNI in existence.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>If/when UNI rewards are turned on (on a per-pool basis) those who want to benefit from the fees will probably have to &quot;stake&quot; their UNI in a specific pool (or the protocol writ large) like you currently do in AAVE or SushiSwap or Synthetix or a dozen other protocols. Just like the &quot;airdropped&quot; 400 UNI was not automatically sent to everyone who was eligible, but rather, had to be manually claimed by each eligible address. (In fact <a href=\"https://duneanalytics.com/MatteoLeibowitz/uniswap-community\">only 132 million UNI</a> out of the 150 million UNI available to be claimed from the &quot;airdrop&quot; has been done so). </p>\n\n<p>Third, <strong>1 billion UNI is not currently <em>in</em> circulation</strong>. Coingecko puts that figure at <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap\">519,857,388 UNI</a>. Although I&#39;m not sure how confident to be in that number, we know definitively that hundreds of million of UNI are not in circulation. </p>\n\n<p>We can go over what we know based on the <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/\">UNI announcement</a> from September 2020: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We know that a total of 400 million UNI is earmarked for the team, investors and advisors and is being released on a vested 4-year schedule. </p></li>\n<li><p>We know that 430 million UNI is earmarked for the governance treasury. So far, governance has distributed around $1 million of UNI in two waves of the Uniswap Grants Program. (There is also a total of $1 million of UNI available for the v3 bug bounty program, but we have yet to see how much of that will actually be paid out, if any). Being generous and using a price of $30/UNI (the price on March 16, 2021 when the first Wave was announced) let&#39;s assume that 33,333 UNI (worth $1 million on March 16) has so far been given out in the UGP and thus would be able to accrue protocol fees. That still leaves ~429,966,667 UNI that is earmarked for governance and not currently in circulation. </p></li>\n<li><p>A maximum of <a href=\"https://imgur.com/oFwcmpo\">5 million UNI</a> was earmarked for the liquidity mining program that ran for ~60 days from September to November 2020, although I&#39;m not sure how much was actually distributed.

I can still claim that 9 ETH are buy and hold, so 0% tax and the 1 ETH is taxed as income up to 48%, right?\"\n\nTo which I had the answer,\n\n\"The IRS won't care, since it's a grey area, they may consider that everything in your wallet is subject to business activity and they may tax everything. So even if you have a stack that was never touched inside a wallet that has interactions with the network and a great number of transactions.\"\n\nI hope this has been well explained.\n\nIf you only have one wallet, for example, a Ledger where you keep all your ETH but sometimes you use that Ledger to interact with the network to claim a airdrop, trade a shitcoin, open a CDP, close a CDP, etc, if you made a profit EVERYTHING can be subject to taxation. It will depend on the number of transactions you have.\n\n----\n\nCrypto to crypto, how does it work?\n\nAt the moment, they don't care. If you swap from BTC to ETH, **AT THE MOMENT** this is not a taxable event. IT WILL in the future, just like in the USA. The sentiment is that crypto will be taxed just like stocks here, at 28% flat rate if you're an individual. It is already taxed at 21% if you are a company and you invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo 1 BTC = 1000\u20ac, it goes up to 5000\u20ac, you trade to ETH, you most likely will pay 28% of the difference between 5000\u20ac and 1000\u20ac.\n\nWe had a discussion about the USA/UK/Spain, etc and they said the US is the most severe country in terms of crypto laws. Spain is also a very severe country and is making their citizens include ALL their transactions when they do their taxes at the end of the year. It seems, they think Romania has a flat tax of 10% for crypto and that's it, pretty cool.\n\n----\n\nIf you come and cashout, can the government ask you to show proof of transactions and you may need to disclose your wallet? YES. As a citizen you have the duty to comply with the IRS, if you do not comply they can ask the police to seize your shit. Yeah buddy! This is the one that scared me the most. Crypto will not be anonymous if the government wants.\n\n----\n\nToo many cashout transactions can be labeled as a business activity and taxed up to 48%? Yep, as stupid as this sounds my CPA was also right. Too many transactions from your favorite exchange can be labeled as a business activity. There was someone who had this issues here in the country, not due to crypto but still a lot of transactions might mean taxation.\n\nDepends on how many times you send money to your bank account. Maybe once a month is not, maybe once every three months is not, the less transactions the better.\n\n----\n\nStaking taxed? Yield farming taxed? Claim and yield farming compounding taxed? There's two options, you either claim it or you don't. If you claim it as an \"interest payment\" you'll pay flat tax rate of 28% just like normal interest payments/stocks, etc.\n\nThis is seen as the most accepted idea of any crypto taxation. 28% flat tax rate for everything. Staking, yield farming, etc.\n\n----\n\nETH to rETH or any other staking token/Crypto to staking token taxed?\n\nNah, the token that you receive after staking in a service like Rocketpool, Lido, etc isn't taxed. It is looked as a certificate of deposit that you can use to retrieve your initial deposit, so no taxation. The USA in this case taxes you and it's extremely dumb.\n\n----\n\nCrypto loans are taxed?\n\nNo, it's a loan. The IRS just doesn't know what a CDP is.\n\n----\n\nWhat are most people doing then?\n\nMost portuguese people are opening a company, similar to a S-Corp in the USA. They have all their transactions go through the company and they pay the 21% flat tax rate. If they want to distribute some of they money to themselves it's another 28%.\n\n----\n\nThe consensus seems to be, by their words, that there are a ton of grey areas and if the IRS wants to fuck you up, they will. You can go to court to battle them but it will take a lot of years.\n\nThe 0% tax rate was/is a bit of a meme after all as I've been saying for years if you check my post history. The tax man will want some of your apple pie if it smells like millions of euros. You'll safe if you just bought and hold and you can prove to them that you really just bought and held.\n\nThere's no free lunch in this world.\n\nI apologize for the not so good news, we chatted for a couple of hours, they really knew their shit about crypto, they mentioned DeFi, NFT's, etc, etc, the bill was pretty high but atleast I got some knowledge that subconsciously I already knew due to previous conversations with my CPA and tax seasons.\n\nIt's sad that a country that sensationalizes 0% tax rate for crypto is doing it in a non transparent way.\n\nI don't think I forgot anything but if I did, I'll just edit and add it at the end of the comment.\n\n/u/LogrisTheBard tagging you since you asked for more information.\n\nEDIT: Can someone tell me if Vitalik pays his taxes? If he does, then so shall I. I am no better than just some guy.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TL;DR: Portuguese tax situation. If you buy and hold, 0% tax.

Note that currently this system uses the cheapest possible GPU, but the recommendation is that in the future one or more high-end GPUs may be required. That will easily add several thousands to this, assuming graphics cards are easily available. Likewise, I've also specced motherboard and power supply to enable two high-end GPUs in the future. Also, I don't think one UPS is sufficient - but we'll have to assume your electricity supply is highly reliable.\n\nThe system as specced above, without GPUs, consumes over 500W of power. Of course, that's more of a peak load, in typical workloads this is more like 300W-400W at this time. Assuming 300W, and an [average US household power cost of $0.13 per kWH](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a), this is an electricity cost of $350/year.\n\nYou'd need high-quality redundant internet connections, with potentially very high bandwidth going forward. I'll assume dual fibre connections, with each costing $100/mo (Google Fibre Business 250 and equivalent), for a total of $2,400/year.\n\n**Overall, it costs \\~$5,000 to build a future-proof PC, and roughly $2,750/year to run a Solana validator node.**\n\nHowever, it doesn't quite end there. Solana's state growth is potentially obscene, if it ever does the throughput they claim. We could easily be at several TBs per month in the network's potential is satured, and it can quickly get to 5 or even 6 figures. For now, with very limited usage, 2 TB will suffice, but for how long?\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nSolana is a very interesting project, and arguably one of the very, very few L1 smart contract protocol outside of Ethereum out there that offers a key USP (another would be Polkadot). In my last comment, I argued that [generalized programmable rollups obsolete most current L1s](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/my0h9s/opinion_rollups_are_4th_gen_blockchains/). Not Solana. Solana has the potential to offer scalability past even rollups, though hybrid solutions like zkPorter/Validium can match it. Unfortunately, once we have data sharding on Ethereum, coming after The Merge, rollups leveraging Ethereum will potentially offer greater scalability than Solana, and through shard block staggering block times of under 0.2s, less than half of Solana. But in the here and now, for the next couple of years, Solana does offer something unique and different, and I welcome it. Solana can also attract rollups in the future to leverage it instead of Ethereum, and it does have a formidable data layer. However, its consensus layer is very, very weak (by design to enable maximum throughput).\n\n**Solana is absolutely not and never will be a decentralized or trustless protocol**. One of the key benefits of Bitcoin and Ethereum is that anyone can run a node - developers, users and service providers alike - without having to trust validators or third-party service providers. You can run Ethereum ~~Eth1+Eth2~~ execution layer + consensus layer on a [Raspberry Pi 4 with 1 TB SSD](https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM/status/1370707678335537154) which can be bought for under $200 and uses 2% of the power and some small fraction of bandwidth. Bitcoin is even easier (some bitcoiners argue Ethereum's requirements are already unacceptable!). These are very different trade-offs, and offer two completely different products, and that should be acknowledged. Of course, rollups solve everything without these trade-offs, but I think I've harped on about those enough!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I wrote a post about Solana&#39;s validator requirements and comparing it with Ethereum.

Note that currently this system uses the cheapest possible GPU, but the recommendation is that in the future one or more high-end GPUs may be required. That will easily add several thousands to this, assuming graphics cards are easily available. Likewise, I&#39;ve also specced motherboard and power supply to enable two high-end GPUs in the future. Also, I don&#39;t think one UPS is sufficient - but we&#39;ll have to assume your electricity supply is highly reliable.</p>\n\n<p>The system as specced above, without GPUs, consumes over 500W of power. Of course, that&#39;s more of a peak load, in typical workloads this is more like 300W-400W at this time. Assuming 300W, and an <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a\">average US household power cost of $0.13 per kWH</a>, this is an electricity cost of $350/year.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;d need high-quality redundant internet connections, with potentially very high bandwidth going forward. I&#39;ll assume dual fibre connections, with each costing $100/mo (Google Fibre Business 250 and equivalent), for a total of $2,400/year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overall, it costs ~$5,000 to build a future-proof PC, and roughly $2,750/year to run a Solana validator node.</strong></p>\n\n<p>However, it doesn&#39;t quite end there. Solana&#39;s state growth is potentially obscene, if it ever does the throughput they claim. We could easily be at several TBs per month in the network&#39;s potential is satured, and it can quickly get to 5 or even 6 figures. For now, with very limited usage, 2 TB will suffice, but for how long?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>\n\n<p>Solana is a very interesting project, and arguably one of the very, very few L1 smart contract protocol outside of Ethereum out there that offers a key USP (another would be Polkadot). In my last comment, I argued that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/my0h9s/opinion_rollups_are_4th_gen_blockchains/\">generalized programmable rollups obsolete most current L1s</a>. Not Solana. Solana has the potential to offer scalability past even rollups, though hybrid solutions like zkPorter/Validium can match it. Unfortunately, once we have data sharding on Ethereum, coming after The Merge, rollups leveraging Ethereum will potentially offer greater scalability than Solana, and through shard block staggering block times of under 0.2s, less than half of Solana. But in the here and now, for the next couple of years, Solana does offer something unique and different, and I welcome it. Solana can also attract rollups in the future to leverage it instead of Ethereum, and it does have a formidable data layer. However, its consensus layer is very, very weak (by design to enable maximum throughput).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solana is absolutely not and never will be a decentralized or trustless protocol</strong>. One of the key benefits of Bitcoin and Ethereum is that anyone can run a node - developers, users and service providers alike - without having to trust validators or third-party service providers. You can run Ethereum <del>Eth1+Eth2</del> execution layer + consensus layer on a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM/status/1370707678335537154\">Raspberry Pi 4 with 1 TB SSD</a> which can be bought for under $200 and uses 2% of the power and some small fraction of bandwidth. Bitcoin is even easier (some bitcoiners argue Ethereum&#39;s requirements are already unacceptable!). These are very different trade-offs, and offer two completely different products, and that should be acknowledged. Of course, rollups solve everything without these trade-offs, but I think I&#39;ve harped on about those enough!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-27 20:58:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gw4vhct","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mzgwyp","parent_id":"t3_mzgwyp","score":35,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"Why does CC always nuke the well-written posts and leave up the drivel?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Why does CC always nuke the well-written posts and leave up the drivel?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-27 21:08:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gw4wgis","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mzgwyp","parent_id":"t1_gw4vhct","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Filibuster69","body":"What kind of Consensus algorith does Solana implement?

Price and market caps are somewhat imaginary to a certain point and can change without any money changing hands, simply because suddenly everybody agrees that the thing is more valuable.\n\nThe non-linearity of the utility of money and the concept of \"life-changing amount\" of course messes this up a bit, but other than that, the imaginable range of a coin's price moves very much like an Overton window. An often-repeated meme-price can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, simply because the range becomes imaginable.\n\nThis is also why things like doge and XRP benefit so largely from their $ price: moving from $0.1 to $1 is very easy to imagine, and we've seen it a thousand times. Going from $10k to $100k? Much less believable.
