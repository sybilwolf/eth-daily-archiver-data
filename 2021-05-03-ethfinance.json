Intuition says that yeah, over time ETH will probably be close to zero net issuance (which is not the same as inflation), but that may not be in July.

Wish he was here to see this. \n\nHe absolutely loved making money was always hustling and worked up until the last year of his life as his health declined. I think he'd be so ecstatic to see how far we've come since 2016. Every wednesday night we would meet up for dinner and it was on one of these nights I told him I'd bought some Ethereum and tried to explain it to him. He didn't really understand it, but he said \"I'll have a punt\" and gave me a few thousand dollars to invest on his behalf.\n\nIn the 2017 run he would sit in his comfy chair at home in front of the TV and just watch the price and text me multiple times a day.

Quick one for the ETHosphere timeline update this week as it\u2019s a holiday weekend for me here in the UK. Taking some time out to relax, and of course watching the price spike like the rest of you degens. The summary of this week is that we don\u2019t have much new, but we do have much more confidence in the Merge and the London upgrade is still on track. I think the market is reacting to something\u2026\n\n**The Merge**\n\n~ On Friday, the first Merge devnet was activated at the Rayonism hackathon. Four Eth2/consensus layer clients (Teku, Prysm, Lighthouse, and Nimbus) achieved various levels of interoperability with three Eth1/execution layer clients (Besu, Nethermind and Geth). Things are looking good for testing so far.\n\n~ It looks like there **will** be an effort made to test sharding and withdrawals, although u/vbuterin [points out](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n1cpbh/tutorial_for_ethereum_merge_testnet/gwc6nmd/) that this test is for the post-transition state of the Merge only - the transition itself is a separate, hopefully simpler, beast that will be informed by the learnings we get from Rayonism. \n\n~ All told this is incredibly bullish. 2021 Merge launch ambition is looking more likely as a result of this, in my view.\n\n**London**\n\n~ Still on track for 14 July. We should find out the specific block numbers for test/mainnet next week.\n\n~ EIP-3529, for reducing gas refunds, is the new EIP-3403. 3529 [will be included](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1388193584726233091) in London.\n\n~ The difficulty bomb EIP, 3238, needs to be re-written to accommodate the change to bring it forward to Dec 2021. Thus 3238 will not be in London, but its eventual replacement will be.\n\n~ EIP-3541 [is also being considered](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/307) for inclusion in London. If included, 3540 should follow in Shanghai. If not, it might be Cancun which is gonna be a while. To be discussed at [the next ACD](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/309)!\n\n~ Due to these EIP updates, the [Baikal devnet has been launched](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md), replacing the Aleut devnet. We hardy knew ye!\n\n**Other bits**\n\n~ Rocketpool - The current (finale?) beta has now concluded! A new more permanent Rocketpool testnet will launch on the Prater testnet in May. This is effectively the mainnet release candidate for Rocketpool and will include updates off the back of the audit recommendations. I feel like we say this every week, but, mainnet edges closer! Am still picking June until they tell me otherwise.\n\n~ Uniswap v3 lands this week, Wednesday! Remember that it\u2019s not planned to launch on Optimism L2 - that is still to come. All eyes\u2026\n\n~ And those are the main timeline updates. Not much change in the L2 landscape this week afaik, but some weeks are like that!\n\n\u2014\n\n**THE TIMELINE**\n\nAll dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.\n\n**Q2 (Apr-Jun) 2021**\n\n* 16 April to 14 May - [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/).

We should find out the specific block numbers for test/mainnet next week.</p>\n\n<p>~ EIP-3529, for reducing gas refunds, is the new EIP-3403. 3529 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1388193584726233091\">will be included</a> in London.</p>\n\n<p>~ The difficulty bomb EIP, 3238, needs to be re-written to accommodate the change to bring it forward to Dec 2021. Thus 3238 will not be in London, but its eventual replacement will be.</p>\n\n<p>~ EIP-3541 <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/307\">is also being considered</a> for inclusion in London. If included, 3540 should follow in Shanghai. If not, it might be Cancun which is gonna be a while. To be discussed at <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/309\">the next ACD</a>!</p>\n\n<p>~ Due to these EIP updates, the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md\">Baikal devnet has been launched</a>, replacing the Aleut devnet. We hardy knew ye!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other bits</strong></p>\n\n<p>~ Rocketpool - The current (finale?) beta has now concluded! A new more permanent Rocketpool testnet will launch on the Prater testnet in May. This is effectively the mainnet release candidate for Rocketpool and will include updates off the back of the audit recommendations. I feel like we say this every week, but, mainnet edges closer! Am still picking June until they tell me otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>~ Uniswap v3 lands this week, Wednesday! Remember that it\u2019s not planned to launch on Optimism L2 - that is still to come. All eyes\u2026</p>\n\n<p>~ And those are the main timeline updates. Not much change in the L2 landscape this week afaik, but some weeks are like that!</p>\n\n<p>\u2014</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE TIMELINE</strong></p>\n\n<p>All dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q2 (Apr-Jun) 2021</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>16 April to 14 May - <a href=\"https://rayonism.io/\">Rayonism</a>.

It&#39;s just weird that there are people willing to buy near/at All Time High but not when it&#39;s in this limbo state. It feels like a spring has been winding back for the past 2-3 years and the pressure is getting harder to hold down. </p>\n\n<p>No doubt in my mind that eth will eventually have it&#39;s fabled &gt;$1k+ bull run. And when it does, I&#39;ll find it perplexing that the price will just randomly start increasing by hundreds every week, for seemingly no reason at all. As if collectively the market will have flipped a switch and realize how undervalued eth is and the potential future value it holds.</p>\n\n<p>Soon \u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was wondering who would be buying at these prices. </p>\n\n<p>The answer is me. I am buying at these prices. It turns out you can never have too much ETH. Granted I am buying less due to other unrelated circumstances.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-02 23:50:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gwr71vg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n3ob9p","parent_id":"t3_n3ob9p","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/laninsterJr","body":"After July 14th, everyone using ETH is buying.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>After July 14th, everyone using ETH is buying.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-03 00:16:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gwr8qck","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n3ob9p","parent_id":"t1_gwr71vg","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"I don't think I ever plan to not be buying.

Well here\u2019s Logris breaking down YFI for you.\n\n[Here\u2019s](https://docs.yearn.finance/faq#what-are-the-fees) a breakdown of the types of Yearn Vault fees:\n\nVault Version|Management Fee|Performance Fee|Withdrawal Fee\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nv1|n/a|20%|0.5%\nv2|2%|20%|n/a\n\nLet's break down the calculation of each type of fee.\n\n**Withdrawal fees**\n\nThese are fees applied when someone exits a vault if there aren\u2019t enough idle funds to handle the withdrawal.\n\n[YTD Withdrawal Fee](https://duneanalytics.com/lotti/yfi-metrics): 8,099,473-6,505,529=1,593,944\n\nThis is over 123 days, so projected annual income from withdrawals of $4,654,316\n\n**Performance Fee**\n\nThese are the fees taken by the platform on each harvest. Half of these fees go to the treasury, the other half pay the strategy creator.\n\nI don\u2019t have a dashboard that shows historical income for each vault (let me know if you find one) so I just have to estimate this using the % yield on each vault and the vault AUM.\n\nData from yearn.fi. The APY listed is an average of the last 7 days which I know is short but I don\u2019t have a dashboard to show historical trends of harvests YTD or something longer term. I\u2019m assuming the APY listed is *after* the 20% performance fee so total harvest \\* 0.8 = APY -> management fee = 0.1 * (APY / 0.8).

I went through the adrenalin rushes of the previous bull run, waking up to thousands of fresh $$$ on an almost daily basis. I barely slept, I felt nervous and ecstatic the whole time, especially from Oct 2017 to beginning of January 2018. I took small profits here and there, bought some nice electronics and paid for a holiday, but for the most part I invested in the wrong shitcoins and after January 2018 I saw my wallet begin its slow descent from kinda life-changing money to a few thousand dollars over the course of years. \n\nWell I thought that experience desensitized me. I have some friends who got into crypto since the start of the pandemic, and it's been fun to see them get all excited from the pumps and watch them panic through every single correction.

I went through the adrenalin rushes of the previous bull run, waking up to thousands of fresh $$$ on an almost daily basis. I barely slept, I felt nervous and ecstatic the whole time, especially from Oct 2017 to beginning of January 2018. I took small profits here and there, bought some nice electronics and paid for a holiday, but for the most part I invested in the wrong shitcoins and after January 2018 I saw my wallet begin its slow descent from kinda life-changing money to a few thousand dollars over the course of years. </p>\n\n<p>Well I thought that experience desensitized me. I have some friends who got into crypto since the start of the pandemic, and it&#39;s been fun to see them get all excited from the pumps and watch them panic through every single correction.

This means that your basis in the property is the same as the donor's basis in the property. More specifically, if the FMV of the property at the time of the gift was equal to or greater than the donor's adjusted basis, your basis in the property immediately after the gift will be the same as the donor's adjusted basis at the time you received the gift. If the donor paid any gift tax, you should increase your basis by all or part of the gift tax paid, depending on the date of the gift.\n\nFor example, your father gives you XYZ stock today that is currently worth $1,000. Your father has an adjusted basis in the stock of $500. Your basis in the stock, for purposes of determining gain on any future sale of the stock, is $500 (transferred basis).\n\nIf the FMV of the property at the time of the gift was less than the donor's adjusted basis, your basis for gain on its sale or other disposition is the same as the donor's adjusted basis, plus or minus any required adjustments to basis during the period you held the property.\n\nA different rule applies if you sell gifted property at a loss. If the FMV of the property at the time of the gift was less than the donor's adjusted basis, your basis for loss on its sale or other disposition is its FMV at the time of the gift, plus or minus any required adjustments to basis during the period you held the property. In other words, for purposes of determining losses, you use the lesser of the donor's adjusted basis or the FMV at the time of the gift as your basis.\n\nFor example, your father gives you XYZ stock today that is currently worth $200. At the time of the gift, he has an adjusted tax basis in the stock of $500. After receiving the stock, you immediately sell it for $200. You do not recognize a loss because your basis in the stock was its FMV at the time of the gift, $200.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Source?</p>\n\n<p>If I buy eth at $1 and gift it to my dad when the price is $100 and he sells it at $1000, he ends up paying for a gain of 900.
