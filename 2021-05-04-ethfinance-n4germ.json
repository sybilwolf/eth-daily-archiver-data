I know many of you are older here, so I&#39;m coming for advice. I am almost 22 and this recent run has put me over $200k worth of ETH, been holding since high school. Yes, hardware wallet. I have paid off college so far + have stables for the remaining years I have left. I am only holding ETH, earning $3-4k/month in yield farming on top of my holdings. I have never had this much money and I really don&#39;t know what the fuck to do now. Do I wait for the top and diversify into some Vanguard funds? I can&#39;t ask anyone I know for advice because they&#39;d start asking for handouts. I have been developing on the blockchain for a while and believe in the tech but know that this is cyclical.

This started right at the midnight UTC close last night (7:00 CDT).  Like clockwork, the selloff commenced.   I didn't update the dips list because we didn't dip 10% before I went to bed.  This morning, I woke up to a new ATH at 8 AM CDT.  Interesting.  But we DID dip 10% from that point, so...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Jan 9-10--$1350 to $905--32.96%\n* (8 days from dip to next ATH)\n* Jan 18-21--$1440 to $1039--27.85%\n* (3 days from dip to next ATH)\n* Jan 24-26--$1477 to $1206--18.35%\n* (17 days from dip to next ATH)\n* Feb 12-14--$1877 to $1659--11.61%\n* (5 days from dip to next ATH)\n* February 19-28--$2041 to $1315--35.57%\n* (33 long days from dip to next ATH)\n* April 5-7--$2151 to $1929--10.32%\n* (8 days from dip to ATH)\n* April 15-17--$2548 to $2000--21.51%\n* (5 days from dip to ATH)\n* April 22-23--$2612 to $2040--21.90%\n* (MANY ATHs along the way...basically a new ATH every day for a week straight!)\n* May 4 AM--$3534 to $3175--10.16%  \n* (WEN next ATH?)\n\nI don't trade the ratio.  I hodl both BTC and ETH and I consider them separate hodlings.  But it's worth noting that the ratio is 0.06+.  We've all believed that ETH was undervalued in light of utility, usage, EIP-1559, and the upcoming ETH 2.0 merge, and the market has seemingly recognized this.  ETH is up more than 3x since the trough of the dip on January 10th.  \n\nETH has been aggressively re-pricing against other assets as it travels through price discovery.   Gotta be honest...I don't think this re-pricing is done.
