My takes:\n\n* Too risky for me. With large capitals at stake you want as less risk as possible. Flash crashes can and will wipe you out in case of a black swan event.\n* Pure ETH staking currently has an APR of 7.5% at the base layer on top of a (soon to be) deflating asset. This is without fee rewards after the merge which:\n   * Will bump it up temporary to +-25% APR\n   * Will decrease in APR when more people stake --> Higher ETH price.\n* Don't be too greedy... It will bite you in the end.\n\nTLDR: The APR of staking ETH (base layer) yields enough rewards for large capital without the added risk of smart contract constructions on higher layers with multiple risk vectors.

Based on today&#39;s daily Eth fees, fair market value with a 50x P/E is just about $3k, and I think momentum could carry us even lower during a bear, especially if fees drop off significantly as well.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-06 13:39:45","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-05-06 13:43:37","id":"gx7126d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n5zly6","parent_id":"t3_n5zly6","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/suicidaleggroll","body":"To add to this, people seem to be under the impression that the drop after the peak is SUPER fast, so you have to sell on the rise up or you'll miss it.
