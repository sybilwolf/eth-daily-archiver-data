It requires smart contracts that can do-away and automate most tasks to bring down costs (so you can return to yields to the borrowers, instead of salaried people), and at the same time also need the lego-esque composability that only ETH possesses right now. Yes, you can fork everything, but without the raw brain power fueling such innovation, its sacrilegious to compare them IMO.\n2.

I watched the [Bankless AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y87CieUoaZc) yesterday, and I really liked the vision and idea driving behind the DAO that Alchemix is building. This is something to be re-assessed once more concrete details are out, but as it stands, it seems that the ALCX 10% fees on yields will be return to the DAO holders. The founder mentioned dividends, but given the gas fees of ETH right now, I am sceptical of this method of cash flow returns.  \nNothing revolutionary about this, as Maker for one, does share buybacks, but one other point that caught my attention was the idea of material points and shards (IIRC the names). A unique take on DAO, and its future planned gamification reminds me a little of Aavegotchi. You can use the governance points on either voting rights, or NFTs for your character, *a la Aavegotchi*. And unlike Aavegotchi which is an NFT game wrapped in DeFi, ALCX is a DeFi wrapped in NFT, which is something that naturally would have a higher intrinsic value (you can't price enjoyment in a game however)\n\nTo conclude, I believe that ALCX is the first of its kind in DeFi platforms that are blockchain-native, and something that ETH can only pull of right now. It's unique approach to rethinking finance makes this arguably a groundbreaking business that is worth a look. \n\nThere are risks of course like smart contract risk, de-pegging risk, lower yields risk, etc. But as a whole, I am pretty excited. **(disclosure) I bought a little yesterday**, divesting from RPL (I know, forgive me guys, but it was either RPL or ETH), and will re-assess and likely invest more as v2 is up and the DAO gets fully fleshed out.\n\nEdit: another point that I've missed also is the psychologically advantage of future yield tokenization platforms like ALCX over Debt-backed stablecoins like DAI/LUSD/USDP.
