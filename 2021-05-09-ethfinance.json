We have seen Intel struggle with many more speculative execution vulnerabilities in the Spectre/Meltdown family over the last few years. AMD has been much more secure. Furthermore, most Intel NUCs share the same BIOS codebases, and a severe vulnerability could hypothetically - however unlikely - knock every NUC off the grid. As important as software (client) diversity is, so is hardware diversity.</p>\n\n<p>- The AMD platform comes with some other advantages over older Intel 10th gen and earlier NUCs (such as higher memory speed/capacity support), but I&#39;m happy to report Intel NUC 11 Pro has attained feature parity on most fronts.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and it&#39;s cheaper than Intel&#39;s NUCs (significantly so than NUC 11 Pro that&#39;s required for parity), which come with that good old Intel premium. AMD is forced to offer a discount despite its significant technological advantage over Intel, due to market perception/ignorance. (I&#39;m sure ETH holders can relate to that...)</p>\n\n<p>PS: Please feel free to repost this to <a href=\"/r/ethstaker\">r/ethstaker</a>.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-09 11:37:25","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-05-09 11:43:31","id":"gxiuqo8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n86zzj","parent_id":"t3_n86zzj","score":60,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/flabbergaster1","body":"So what you're saying is invest in AMD.

Triple halvening.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk. I'm not fucking selling.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Has anyone ever thought about that it&#39;s entirely possible that ETH just flips Bitcoin within a couple months?</p>\n\n<p>Before you say I&#39;m overdosing on hopium, consider.</p>\n\n<p>ETH is showing incredible strength here. None of the eth killer narratives ultimately stuck, and we don&#39;t give a flying fuck about BTC&#39;s prive movements these past two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a clear indication that deep pocketed people are rotating from BTC to ETH, and from alts to ETH. Also 99% sure institutions are buying right now, which explains the sustained buying pressure.</p>\n\n<p>What if Bitcoiners rotate into ETH, in addition to institutions? What if institutions that buy ETH, eg Tesla, explain their buys a la &quot;we see the strong potential for Ethereum to be a global settlement layer / we recognize that decentralized finance is incredibly useful and are looking at how to integrate these tools into our business&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>IF Tesla bought ETH, expect a gigapump. </p>\n\n<p>There are so many confounding factors at play here.</p>\n\n<p>1) Bitcoiners rotating into ETH on the ratio breakout, they feel intense FOMO and don&#39;t want to be left behind if we flip BTC</p>\n\n<p>2) Institutions buying ETH, this is pretty clear to me. Extremely bullish because Bitcoin can&#39;t claim this for itself anymore</p>\n\n<p>3) Higher price -&gt; attention on fundamentals -&gt; people buy ETH -&gt; higher price</p>\n\n<p>4) Attention on fundamentals: EIP-1559 + the merge. 1559 is confirmed for July 14th, very low execution risk. PoS been delayed for ages. If it happens this year, it&#39;s the fulfillment of a very old prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>-&gt; broad market realizes Ethereum is about to go green and deflationary.

In a few minutes, you will receive a response from the bot that includes your claim link (or an error message).\n\n\nThere are some important caveats I need to share:\n\n\\* Your reddit account must be two months old and have 10 karma to claim this badge.\n\n\\* Some POAPs have potential value - but probably not this one (pretty much anyone can get it), please only take one. \n\n\\* If you're not able to claim this due to the age of your account or karma, don't despair! There will be more!\n\n\\* We highly suggest that you use an unfunded Ethereum wallet to claim POAPs. It's not good practice to link your POAP badges to your assets.\n\n\\* Collecting POAPs is cool, but when you have enough, the wallet can easily be linked to you. This is GOOD and fun, but you don't want to dox your assets.\n\n\\* POAPs tools (like the [raffle at poap.fun](https://poap.fun)) do not interface well with hardware wallets, we recommend using a native metamask wallet for easy POAP management.\n\n\\* No one should EVER ask for your private key or seed phrase. Guard these items with all of your might. When you receive a POAP claim link, you will be prompted to enter your wallet address, this wallet address is public.\n\nThanks to /u/worthalter for developing POAP, /u/Bad_Investment for developing the Reddit bot, /u/unvetica_solutions for creating the image, and the users and moderators for keeping it fun. :)\n\nSee the claims here: https://poap.gallery/event/2081","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This message contains an official claim for the <a href=\"/r/EthFinance\">/r/EthFinance</a> POAP claim for Ether being valued at $4000.
