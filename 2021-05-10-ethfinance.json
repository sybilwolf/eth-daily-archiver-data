This is this week\u2019s ETHosphere Timeline update where I state many of the big things upcoming in Ethereum in one big consolidated list. Sorry for repost - I f'd up and linked to c0intelegraph. Many thanks u/zk_snacks! \n\n~The big news this week was **[the launch of Uniswap v3](https://uniswap.org/blog/launch-uniswap-v3/)!** Always good to see a big update like this deliver on time. The launch wasn\u2019t painless and the fees are still eye-watering, but it\u2019s out in the wild now with $500m TVL as of today - hope you\u2019ve all got your tight ranges set appropriately and that you were rewarded with rare [sparkly phalluses](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1390034790653599746). That just leaves one big unanswered question\u2026 Optimism on v3 wen? Official update is that there\u2019s no definitive date yet. Grumble.\n\n~Speaking of optimistic rollups, [OKEx announced itself](https://www.okex.com/support/hc/en-us/articles/360060706511) as the first major centralised exchange to **enable direct deposits and withdrawals to its impending layer 2 rollups integration with Arbitrum**. This is great because it means users will be able to bypass expensive fees on the L1 and trade immediately on L2. L2 bridges to other dapps will only enhance this, until we have a whole ecosystem of L2 dapps to choose from. Now, we still don\u2019t know when Arbitrum is going to launch (it\u2019s on the timeline for May) but its mainnet release candidate is already up on the Kovan testnet - it\u2019s got to be soon. Offchain Labs, please!\n\n~To round up dapp updates, decentralised staking pool solution **Rocketpool announced a subsequent round of security audits that will kick off on 17 May**. This is off the back of initial audits findings to ensure those findings have been properly implemented. Audits on top of audits? Maybe evenmoar audits needed! Timeline-wise, this probably pushes back the mainnet release to July, although June feels possible if things move quickly. This, I\u2019m sure, is frustrating for those who had originally hoped the project would launch in March, but the team have been steadfast in their resolve to not launch until security auditing is fully completed and findings implemented. Stay strong early adopters, your time will come!\n\nProtocol updates:\n\n~ **The Merge: The Rayonism hackathon enters its final week this week.** A good summary of the work to date [is here](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210508#Rayonism). This week the aim will be to get a less transient merge testnet in place off the back of learnings from last week\u2019s successful test. Still looking good, and discussions around the post-London feature fork (Shanghai) will be enlightened by the results of Rayonism.\n\n~ **London / EIP-1559:** Still on track for 14 July, the [Baikal devnet](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md) is running. Proposed block numbers and testnet fork dates [are public](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245). A [new call](https://youtu.be/qce2M4ot8ls) to discuss operational readiness for the upgrade has started. This seeks to align all stakeholders across the various related projects (eg tooling, libraries) to ensure nothing is missed ahead of the upgrade. A [handy tracker](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/london.md#ecosystem-readiness-checklist) exists! Additionally, there were a few technical improvements/fixes proposed for the 1559 spec which Tim Beiko [covers here](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1390706275722227713).\n\n~ **Altair: The summer Eth2 upgrade, is progressing in parallel.** [Latest update from the client teams is that July](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210508#Altair), or possibly early August, is the current launch ambition. This is consistent with the previous update.\n\nSuper!\n\n\u2014\n\n**THE TIMELINE** \n\n~ Ethereum protocol upgrades / hardforks in **bold**.\n\n~ All dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.\n\n**Q2 (Apr-Jun) 2021**\n\n* 16 April to 14 May - [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/).

This is this week\u2019s ETHosphere Timeline update where I state many of the big things upcoming in Ethereum in one big consolidated list. Sorry for repost - I f&#39;d up and linked to c0intelegraph. Many thanks <a href=\"/u/zk_snacks\">u/zk_snacks</a>! </p>\n\n<p>~The big news this week was <strong><a href=\"https://uniswap.org/blog/launch-uniswap-v3/\">the launch of Uniswap v3</a>!</strong> Always good to see a big update like this deliver on time. The launch wasn\u2019t painless and the fees are still eye-watering, but it\u2019s out in the wild now with $500m TVL as of today - hope you\u2019ve all got your tight ranges set appropriately and that you were rewarded with rare <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1390034790653599746\">sparkly phalluses</a>. That just leaves one big unanswered question\u2026 Optimism on v3 wen? Official update is that there\u2019s no definitive date yet. Grumble.</p>\n\n<p>~Speaking of optimistic rollups, <a href=\"https://www.okex.com/support/hc/en-us/articles/360060706511\">OKEx announced itself</a> as the first major centralised exchange to <strong>enable direct deposits and withdrawals to its impending layer 2 rollups integration with Arbitrum</strong>. This is great because it means users will be able to bypass expensive fees on the L1 and trade immediately on L2. L2 bridges to other dapps will only enhance this, until we have a whole ecosystem of L2 dapps to choose from. Now, we still don\u2019t know when Arbitrum is going to launch (it\u2019s on the timeline for May) but its mainnet release candidate is already up on the Kovan testnet - it\u2019s got to be soon. Offchain Labs, please!</p>\n\n<p>~To round up dapp updates, decentralised staking pool solution <strong>Rocketpool announced a subsequent round of security audits that will kick off on 17 May</strong>. This is off the back of initial audits findings to ensure those findings have been properly implemented. Audits on top of audits? Maybe evenmoar audits needed! Timeline-wise, this probably pushes back the mainnet release to July, although June feels possible if things move quickly. This, I\u2019m sure, is frustrating for those who had originally hoped the project would launch in March, but the team have been steadfast in their resolve to not launch until security auditing is fully completed and findings implemented. Stay strong early adopters, your time will come!</p>\n\n<p>Protocol updates:</p>\n\n<p>~ <strong>The Merge: The Rayonism hackathon enters its final week this week.</strong> A good summary of the work to date <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210508#Rayonism\">is here</a>. This week the aim will be to get a less transient merge testnet in place off the back of learnings from last week\u2019s successful test. Still looking good, and discussions around the post-London feature fork (Shanghai) will be enlightened by the results of Rayonism.</p>\n\n<p>~ <strong>London / EIP-1559:</strong> Still on track for 14 July, the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md\">Baikal devnet</a> is running. Proposed block numbers and testnet fork dates <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245\">are public</a>. A <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qce2M4ot8ls\">new call</a> to discuss operational readiness for the upgrade has started. This seeks to align all stakeholders across the various related projects (eg tooling, libraries) to ensure nothing is missed ahead of the upgrade. A <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/london.md#ecosystem-readiness-checklist\">handy tracker</a> exists! Additionally, there were a few technical improvements/fixes proposed for the 1559 spec which Tim Beiko <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1390706275722227713\">covers here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>~ <strong>Altair: The summer Eth2 upgrade, is progressing in parallel.</strong> <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210508#Altair\">Latest update from the client teams is that July</a>, or possibly early August, is the current launch ambition. This is consistent with the previous update.</p>\n\n<p>Super!</p>\n\n<p>\u2014</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE TIMELINE</strong> </p>\n\n<p>~ Ethereum protocol upgrades / hardforks in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>~ All dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q2 (Apr-Jun) 2021</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>16 April to 14 May - <a href=\"https://rayonism.io/\">Rayonism</a>.
