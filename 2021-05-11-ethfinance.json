More bullish people would say that the actual adoption curve has been super linear so even that's undershooting it.

Regardless of whether fees are burned or given to stakers both count as protocol revenue.

In that case hopefully you can make more revenue off the yETH vault to offset losing out on the inflation rewards of staking. If the vault had 5% APR and you Double Logris it to 10% effective APR, you might be ahead even while forfeiting the potential 2% inflation you could receive by staking.
