Decisions. Ramblings of a paranoid newly rich crypto \u201cinvestor\u201d **\n\n\nHi everyone and welcome to my crazy ramblings, I have no one else to talk to about this. Using a throwaway and tor, cause well, I\u2019m paranoid.\nI\u2019m 21M still living with my parents in Europe. \n\nI have been working since I was 16 and have been doing University part-time since 2019 while still working full-time. I am now earning $80k and have a net worth of $1.5MM.\n\n\nI\u2019ve never really liked work and in 2017 I found r/financialindependence. I liked the retire early part; the part where I still had to work 20+ years kind of bugged me but I\u2019m relatively frugal and it seems the surest way to retire early. Around that same time, I also found r/ethtrader and r/cc but didn\u2019t see it as a viable alternative. But have been shit-posting daily nevertheless.\n\n\nI bought my first crypto in mid-2017 with only a small purchase of about 4 ETH @ $90, and an even smaller amount of BTC plus CB referrals. At the time it wasn\u2019t more than I could afford to lose or even cared much about. At the peak in early-2018 I remember at one point having over $20k which was more than my yearly income at that point, but I was still pretty zen about the whole thing.\n\nThat year, as we all know, crypto crashed over 90% and I lost basically everything.\n\n\nI don\u2019t remember much from 2019 except for working my ass off and saving as much money as I could.\n\n\nOn early-2020 I had 120% (using a CDP) of my portfolio $70k in crypto (roughly 90/10% ETH / BTC )\n\nIn mid-2020 I started second guessing every decision and becoming paranoid (or good OP-SEC what do you think?). The stress of having so much money at risk really got to me and has only been getting worse the more my net worth grows.\n\nI told everyone (even family) that I had ever mentioned crypto to (I never specified amounts), that I had sold everything during the covid-crash, because I was so afraid of anyone finding out how much I really had. And now every time they tell me how dumb it was to sell everything; I have to fake regret.\n\nI changed my seed-phrase and split it (3 of 4) at 2 bank safe-deposit boxes, and 2 other locations, because I was paranoid that my laptop camera could have somehow been hacked and recorded the reflection in my glasses while I was inputting the 24 words in a new ledger nano. Or that someone could $5 wrench attack the words from me that I had memorised entirely.\n\nI\u2019ve also hidden a big knife close to my rooms entrance.\n\nWhen the ledger leak happened, I thoroughly checked the both data-dumps to make sure it was only my e-mail address (a throwaway thank God) that got leaked. Luckily, my physical address wasn\u2019t leaked. I would have moved for sure.\n\nNot a day went by where I didn\u2019t check the charts and the daily. (no camping trips for me, sorry guys)\nIn December 2020 I started selling crypto OTC $100k every time it went up a sizable amount and currently have:\n\n- 40% Crypto (ETH and BTC),\n- 45% in World ETFs (split across 2 brokers and providers)\n- 10% Cash in the bank (I had to split it so that the banks don\u2019t charge negative interest WTF)\n- 5% Gold / Silver\n\nA grand total net worth of 1.5 Million USD. I still can\u2019t fucking believe it. I\u2019m rich.\n\n\nAlas, I still feel like 600K in crypto is a huge amount and too much for me to have in crypto currency, cause I remember how it felt in 2018 when I lost over 95% of all my money. Only this time it is so much more money and like 10 years of work. I am still checking the charts every few hours. Should I sell even more should I buy more. No-one knows and It is really stressing me out.\n\nEven just the ETFs and gold that are unlikely to crash more than 50% are making my heart race from the stress.\n\nThere are so many decisions I could make with my life now, but I feel like Chidi Anagonye in the Good Place.\n\nSell? Buy? Should I quit my job? Do I even want or need to work ever again? How can I even think of retirement I\u2019m still in university and living at home??? Should I go travelling? Would other countries tax(steal) all my money? Learn some new skills? Sail the world? Climb Everest? Hookers and blow? Train for a job I actually like? Become a hermit and play video games all day? How do I tell any dating prospects about my money? How would my lifestyle affect dating? Can I even trust anyone? What do I tell people about how I can afford all this stuff?\n\n\nSorry about the spelling I\u2019m not going to re-read what I wrote it\u2019s too much and well done if you made it this far I guess.\n\n\n**TLDR**: Crypto and my new wealth has given me choices in life but now I\u2019m stressed and paranoid and don\u2019t know what to do. Any ideas about what I should do?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This was supposed to be a post but karma/age requirements</p>\n\n<p>** Decisions. Decisions.

The stress of having so much money at risk really got to me and has only been getting worse the more my net worth grows.</p>\n\n<p>I told everyone (even family) that I had ever mentioned crypto to (I never specified amounts), that I had sold everything during the covid-crash, because I was so afraid of anyone finding out how much I really had. And now every time they tell me how dumb it was to sell everything; I have to fake regret.</p>\n\n<p>I changed my seed-phrase and split it (3 of 4) at 2 bank safe-deposit boxes, and 2 other locations, because I was paranoid that my laptop camera could have somehow been hacked and recorded the reflection in my glasses while I was inputting the 24 words in a new ledger nano. Or that someone could $5 wrench attack the words from me that I had memorised entirely.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve also hidden a big knife close to my rooms entrance.</p>\n\n<p>When the ledger leak happened, I thoroughly checked the both data-dumps to make sure it was only my e-mail address (a throwaway thank God) that got leaked. Luckily, my physical address wasn\u2019t leaked. I would have moved for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Not a day went by where I didn\u2019t check the charts and the daily. (no camping trips for me, sorry guys)\nIn December 2020 I started selling crypto OTC $100k every time it went up a sizable amount and currently have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>40% Crypto (ETH and BTC),</li>\n<li>45% in World ETFs (split across 2 brokers and providers)</li>\n<li>10% Cash in the bank (I had to split it so that the banks don\u2019t charge negative interest WTF)</li>\n<li>5% Gold / Silver</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A grand total net worth of 1.5 Million USD. I still can\u2019t fucking believe it. I\u2019m rich.</p>\n\n<p>Alas, I still feel like 600K in crypto is a huge amount and too much for me to have in crypto currency, cause I remember how it felt in 2018 when I lost over 95% of all my money. Only this time it is so much more money and like 10 years of work. I am still checking the charts every few hours. Should I sell even more should I buy more. No-one knows and It is really stressing me out.</p>\n\n<p>Even just the ETFs and gold that are unlikely to crash more than 50% are making my heart race from the stress.</p>\n\n<p>There are so many decisions I could make with my life now, but I feel like Chidi Anagonye in the Good Place.</p>\n\n<p>Sell? Buy? Should I quit my job? Do I even want or need to work ever again? How can I even think of retirement I\u2019m still in university and living at home??? Should I go travelling? Would other countries tax(steal) all my money? Learn some new skills? Sail the world? Climb Everest? Hookers and blow? Train for a job I actually like? Become a hermit and play video games all day? How do I tell any dating prospects about my money? How would my lifestyle affect dating? Can I even trust anyone? What do I tell people about how I can afford all this stuff?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry about the spelling I\u2019m not going to re-read what I wrote it\u2019s too much and well done if you made it this far I guess.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Crypto and my new wealth has given me choices in life but now I\u2019m stressed and paranoid and don\u2019t know what to do. Any ideas about what I should do?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-12 10:55:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gxvp04e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_naguyo","parent_id":"t3_naguyo","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Got you approved.
