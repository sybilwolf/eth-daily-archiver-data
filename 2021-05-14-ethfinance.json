You would have $50k ordinary income, so you would owe roughly $5000-$6000 in taxes.\n\nLet's say instead that you are an investor with 100 stETH acquired over a year ago. Your stETH generates $50k, but that $50k goes to the asset price going up (yes, I know stETH uses rebases but you can get around that by making a wstETH contract that's a wrapped version of stETH that doesn't rebase but instead just keeps going up). If you sell $50k to be in the same position as the 1st scenario, you would owe zero tax because your gains are long term, so they're taxed at 0% (assuming you have no other income), and after the standard deduction, you have under 40k of gains. Of course this seems like a rather extreme way of dodging taxes but it would be very worth it for someone richer who makes 400k/yr who would only have to pay the 15% long term rate rather than the higher 37% or whatever bracket rate. With the following method you can cash out $40k + 12.4k + 6k (IRA) + 3.6k (HSA)  = $62,000 with zero tax (and twice that if you get married) and you'll still be able to stake and make the same amount of money as the first guy.\n\nAlso, let's say you are an ETH whale with 1000 ETH. Under the first approach you would earn $500k and probably have to pay something like $150k in tax. Under the second approach, you could choose to only sell $100k, allowing the rest to accrue interest tax free.\n\nWhat we need the IRS to clarify is whether stuff like ETH -> wETH and ETH -> stETH and stETH -> wstETH are taxable events. My view is that the first and third are not taxable events since ETH and WETH are 1:1 redeemable for the same asset and by swapping ETH for WETH, you didn't dispose of your long ETH position.

Here we reach another area of struggle with ETH market cap just below BTC. We fall back down to the 0.10-0.14 range and spend some time trading up and down in that range before another huge surge that finally blasts us into the lead.</p>\n\n<p>Once in the lead we gain quickly from there 0.17, 0.18, 0.19... 0.2! Right around 0.2 is where the giga dump occurs. We drop hard, fast, maybe even a flash crash wiping out all long positions. Fellas, you don&#39;t want to have an open CDP at this time. It will be brutal. The <a href=\"/r/bitcoin\">/r/bitcoin</a> crowd will cheer at the CDP carnage. Some people wonder if it is the death of defi.</p>\n\n<p>But once the dust settles, we will begin to rise again from the ashes. Slowly at first, but building momentum as we get closer and closer to reflippening BTC until that crucial moment when we finally slay the dragon with one fell swoop, leaving Bitcoin behind once and for all and taking our rightful spot as the top cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n<p>From there the sky is the limit. A frenzy ensues pushing ETH higher and higher. We will easily see 0.32 on the ratio as Ethereum hype reaches groundbreaking levels.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for coming to my TED talk.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-14 08:02:28","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-05-14 08:04:27","id":"gy3v46k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nc0rpg","parent_id":"t3_nc0rpg","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Inoffensive_Account","body":"How very specific.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How very specific.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-14 08:04:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gy3vd7w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nc0rpg","parent_id":"t1_gy3v46k","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/SwagtimusPrime","body":"0.32 is a very memeable ratio target.

We don't have to focus 100% of our efforts towards one problem. Money is a limiter, but frankly dev time is relatively cheap (especially compared to say sticking with PoW and trying to get miners over to renewables)--- especially with PoS already being 'discovered' if you will.\n\nWith climate change it's all about either reducing output of carbon or increasing the ability to pull it out. A PoW chain will add more carbon to the atmosphere then a PoS chain. Period. People can virtue signal about green energy / low carbon energy, but it's pointless because those same increases would be applicable to the energy used to run a validator. If 50% of PoW energy is green it's pretty reasonable to assume we can get 50% of PoS energy green as well. The centralization of hashpower adds a wrinkle to those percentages, but in general it's not like we PoS is unable to run on carbon neutral power.\n\nPoint of this all being, we have a solution for Bitcoin. It's switching to PoS. So whether its fair that the traditional system is polluting more there is no reason for Bitcoin to stop all environmental progress because someone else it worse. The 'why' circling back to my first point. Carbon output needs to decrease and physics don't care if its 'not fair' to Bitcoin.

That&#39;s fair and I wouldn&#39;t argue against it. However, both will still exist in tandem so both need to be addressed. Humanity as a whole has the ability to focus on two things at once. We don&#39;t have to focus 100% of our efforts towards one problem. Money is a limiter, but frankly dev time is relatively cheap (especially compared to say sticking with PoW and trying to get miners over to renewables)--- especially with PoS already being &#39;discovered&#39; if you will.</p>\n\n<p>With climate change it&#39;s all about either reducing output of carbon or increasing the ability to pull it out. A PoW chain will add more carbon to the atmosphere then a PoS chain. Period. People can virtue signal about green energy / low carbon energy, but it&#39;s pointless because those same increases would be applicable to the energy used to run a validator. If 50% of PoW energy is green it&#39;s pretty reasonable to assume we can get 50% of PoS energy green as well. The centralization of hashpower adds a wrinkle to those percentages, but in general it&#39;s not like we PoS is unable to run on carbon neutral power.</p>\n\n<p>Point of this all being, we have a solution for Bitcoin. It&#39;s switching to PoS. So whether its fair that the traditional system is polluting more there is no reason for Bitcoin to stop all environmental progress because someone else it worse. The &#39;why&#39; circling back to my first point. Carbon output needs to decrease and physics don&#39;t care if its &#39;not fair&#39; to Bitcoin. Every pound matters and if this relatively low hanging fruit is there then it is fair to criticize Bitcoin for not taking it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-14 08:03:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gy3v7nv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nc0rpg","parent_id":"t1_gy3s1oe","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/roboczar","body":"Why do that by spending energy when you can do the same thing with far less energy\n\nIt's about efficiency as much as anything else","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Why do that by spending energy when you can do the same thing with far less energy</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s about efficiency as much as anything else</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-14 07:38:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gy3rrkp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nc0rpg","parent_id":"t1_gy3q63k","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/CandleThief724","body":">So shouldn't people compare BTC's energy usage to what it's replacing?\n\nIn a vacuum, sure.
