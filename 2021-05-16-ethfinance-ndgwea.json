SIX.  We have had an additional six dips between 10% and 20%.  So, on average, MORE than once per month, we get a 10% dip and a 20% dip.\n\nThe last 20% dip was April 22-23, and it brought us to $2040.  We're still 30% higher than we were at that top and about 65% higher than we were at the bottom of that dip on April 23rd.\n\nWe've had three dips that exceed the 23.95% magnitude of this one, though the last one was the monster dip at the end of February.  That one took us 5 weeks to hit a new high. If this one does take 5 weeks for recovery, we are going to be drifting towards EIP-1559 implementation and I think we're likely to see some strength and FOMO.  I believe people will frontrun that and we will NOT wait 5 weeks for another ATH.  I won't be surprised if it takes 2-3 weeks, though.  \n\nWe have absolutely ROARED in the last few weeks.  Ratio has gone bananas.  Price was hitting a new ATH damn near every day.  Some kind of retrace is inevitable at some point.  We just didn't know if it would start at$3000 (nope), $3250 (nope), $3500 (well, we got a little one there) or $3750 (nope) or $4000 (nope) or $4400 (YEP!).  \n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one with 2018 PTSD.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who is now dealing with deltas that are frankly kinda startling in USD terms.  But this is how whales get you to let go of your ETH.  Volatility is scary, but no volatility = no opportunity.  \n\nSide note: I know we like to watch the ratio, but we need to see some strength from BTC over the next week or it will hamper any recovery.  A ratio of 0.08 ain't so great if BTC is at $42K.  It would put us where we are now.  A ratio of 0.07 with BTC at $63,000 would give us another ATH.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Updating the dips list.  This is NOT to say it&#39;s over, because I have no idea.

This is this week\u2019s ETHosphere Timeline update where we state many of the big things upcoming in Ethereum in one big consolidated list.\n\nUpdates from this week:\n\n~ Positive news in L2 scaling wars as Offchain Labs\u2019 optimistic rollups implementation Arbitrum deployed their sequencer testnet this weekend. Devs interested in having a play can read the docs [here.](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet) Additionally, **Arbitrum now has a mainnet date set - [28 May](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/wen-arbitrum-634969c14713). That\u2019s next week!** Everybody is guessing at who their launch partners might be\u2026 not long before they\u2019ll need to reveal. Hopefully Offchain Labs can stick a solid landing here, and if so, they will have beaten Optimism to the punch.\n\n~ Speaking of, the never-officially-committed-to \u201cshortly thereafter\u201d [speculative date of 12 May](https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1374408266118090753) for Uniswap on Optimism has passed with bare silence. The best public info out in ETHosphere on when it might actually happen is a vague June/July. Considering July is the target for Optimism revised public launch, I think this is the most likely shot right now, but again, we are all just guessing.\n\nProtocol updates: \n\n~ Merge: In more good news, the new [Nocturne merge devnet](https://nocturne.rayonism.io/) launched this week as part of Rayonism. Nocturne achieved finality with consensus across 7 clients. Although the hackathon itself is now done, work will continue on The Merge via Nocturne and any follow up dev/testnets, specifically for validator withdrawals as well as a Sharding prototype. However the focus for the client teams will turn to implementing the Altair and London upgrades. When these are sufficiently progressed, The Merge transition will then become the focus. \n\n~ London / 1559: [Still optimistically on track](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1393233876273614851) for mainnet release on 14 July, although with the heavy heavy caveat that seeing how 1559 performs on testnets will be key. Testnets are planned to fork commencing 9 June, so watch this space. EIPs 3541 and 3554 have been officially included in the London scope. See below in the timeline for the full list of included EIPs for London and testnet dates. The All Core Dev calls almost always make for interesting viewing\u2026 in this week\u2019s call from [this timestamp](https://youtu.be/H_T2nNrTuWQ?t=1869) we can observe a push/pull dynamic in that the teams acknowledge both how complex the 1559 delivery is (\u201cthe most YOLO hard fork we\u2019ve done so far.\u201d), with a genuine desire to get visibility of the London changes on testnets as early as possible.
