That one took us 5 weeks to hit a new high. If this one does take 5 weeks for recovery, we are going to be drifting towards EIP-1559 implementation and I think we're likely to see some strength and FOMO.

It has been quite a ride since then.\n\nSince then I made a few foolish decisions, the first of which imagining that I was a trader and could make a profit after \"absorbing\" the knowledge from \"the internets\". I couldn't and lost a not insignificant amount. Quite a bit by investing in a *very* convincing setup that I now consider a scam (Digix DAO with DGX/DGD tokens for those interested).\n\nI got to know some fascinating individuals: /u/jtnichol, /u/redembr, /u/grossbit, /u/hodlor, /u/antiprosynthesis, /u/oldskool47 and many more.\n\nI invested in the DAO and, thanks to the forward-looking community, was able to recuperate the investment on the non-classic branch of ETH after the DAO hack. I watched the DOS attacks that fall and how the Ethereum weathered them all thanks to the enormous brainpower and clear thinking of those involved (Vitalik, Vlad, Gavin,...)\n\nIn the winter 2018 I expected that the price would keep rising until it reached my target, but instead I watched it plummet (but not before treating myself to a motorcycle). At that point I was a firm hodler, apart from selling few ETH here and there for indulgences' sake. Around that time my job had started to become more and more annoying and boring, because my company got more and more involved with another, which happens to be populated by idiots. However, I'm relatively near retirement age and there are very few jobs in my specialty field that the other company in question is not somehow involved with (it's a small country and the field). So I just waited patiently for the price of ETH to rise up to my target price.\n\nAnd last Monday it did and on that day I cashed out a significant portion of ETH, leaving some for staking.\n\nI do not intend to shit on anyone's desk, instead I had a talk with my immediate boss and the director and we agreed that I will wrap up and try and transfer affairs to others until September and then will take a sabbatical for a year and we'll see if/how/how much we will cooperate after that, probably as an external consultant. With the provision that I do not want to hear about the idiot company ever again and that I will not do any work that is remotely linked to them.\n\nI know there will be people here saying I should have waited as the price will rise. Perhaps... But when I look at prices today and imagine feeling that a week ago I could have sold the apportioned part, but today I would again be in the waiting/hoping phase, I know for certain that it was the right decision for me after a long wait.\n\nIt really is liberating that now I look at prices and go \"meh, could be worse, but it will get better and not in a too distant future\" instead of agonising and wishing them to go higher (as if that helps). And this time it really does not matter to me if it's tomorrow, this fall, in a year or 10 years, although I suspect another order of magnitude or perhaps 2 will come faster than anyone expects.\n\nAnd a final word of advice. Unless you're really, *really*, **really** sure you know what you're doing, do not trade. Only now, after 7 years I have finally gotten a feel for the market, which helped me to time the cashing out (I had some leeway in my conditions, but I felt that the upwards path was about to stop). But if I had just held without trading from 2016, I would have around twice as much as I have now. I'm certain that there are others that have profited a lot. But if you're a newbie, without much experience, wait a few years, observe and then perhaps act.\n\nIn the end it was the awareness that I'm a part of something that is truly revolutionary that kept me going. I've been running a full Ethereum node since 2016 and am now have started gathering information, knowledge and HW to put together a validator PC to continue on this path. And, it goes without saying, that Blockchain development will not go anywhere and with all the spare time on my hands, it is a perfect opportunity to learn something new - an activity that gives me enormous pleasure.\n\nAnyway, I haven't been very active here, and am likely to take a break fro reading reddit in general, but I will be sure to check back occasionally, if for nothing else, to remind me of the schizophrenic mood swings of the entire subreddit :)\n\nSo cheers and keep on hodling!\n\nEDIT: Messed up the date: 2016 not 2014","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Exactly a week ago I made the second best decision in the cryptosphere.

The eco statment probably not, it has been in the news recently before Eltons Twitter posts so I believe that will be an fundamental investing issue going forward for large corps.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is Ethereum knows this and is moving to PoS at the end of the year, this is obviously awesome as it takes out the whole eco thing and the fact that it has been on the project time line for so long shows that the network deems this as important. People will see that.</p>\n\n<p>ETH has the all the foundations and working products for Defi, its is improving all the time, a major upgrade coming in 2 months, POS coming early 2022. Hundreds of Defi apps, NFTs, LD pools for your money (Like banks saving accounts but better), games... the ecosystem is growng by the day.</p>\n\n<p>So please, dont be worried. It will be OK!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-17 10:52:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gygz3u8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ne77c3","parent_id":"t1_gygwtj5","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cutlikebutter","body":"Thanks very much for the reassurance!

This is similar to AAVE staking. The exact mechanisms of the insurance aren\u2019t out yet but what is known is the DAO makes profit by [skimming yearn harvests](https://alchemixfi.medium.com/a-prelude-to-alchemixdao-c69fa9b0bb30).\n\n>When we harvest the yield, we take a 10% cut which goes to the treasury, and yearn pays us affiliate fees for adding TVL to their protocol. When Alchemix v2 is released later this year, we will add multiple collateral types for alUSD, including USDC and USDT. We will also add more al-Assets, such as alETH and alBTC. Each of these vaults will have the same 10% fee applied to harvests.\n\nNow [Scroopy says](https://youtu.be/Y87CieUoaZc?t=3477) they\u2019re pulling in 10-20k a day plus a 30% affiliate fee. If we just take that 20k number at face value we would get profit of 3.65-7.3M which is definitely on the low end for a protocol worth 345M and implies a PE of 47.35 but let\u2019s have a look at how to derive this number ourselves.\n\nHere\u2019s the [dashboard](https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/alchemix-harvests-Mza34X) they use. It is surprisingly spiky. It is showing growth but his 20k estimate isn\u2019t unreasonable so I\u2019ll stick with it for now.\n\nAnd [here\u2019s](https://www.yfistats.com/financials/financials.html) the best analytics I\u2019ve been able to find on yearn. The reason I went digging into yearn is because I wanted to know if the yfi affiliate program was included in the chart above or not. I was surprised to find an alcx v2 vault on yearn in their data. It has been there since March 4\u2019th earning income but I don\u2019t actually see it on their website to use it myself. Despite how thorough this reporting portal is, I still don\u2019t see any lines for their affiliate program payments so I have to ignore that income for now or assume it is included in the yearn harvests. I did try though, let me know if you have a source and I\u2019ll edit this post.\n\nThe other thing I\u2019d like to mention regarding revenue is the transmuter boost. There is a reason I wrote out that explainer post before this one. Strictly speaking the transmuter funds are managed by the governance system. It\u2019s like a treasury that has been earmarked to protect the alUSD peg and promote protocol growth. However, the DAO does have governance access over them. If the DAO were to dissolve Alchemix, they could just distribute the transmuter funds to themselves. alUSD holders would be left just holding the bag and it would be a dick move but it\u2019s possible. So in addition to the official 3.3M treasury there is actually like 220M in additional DAO managed funds plus the ALCX in the treasury. Now, treasuries themselves just serve as a market cap floor in my modeling but, as I point out in the transmuter boost post, Alchemix users forfeit their interest to the protocol in exchange for their loan. Your debt is reduced but the DAI you would earn and compound ends up in the transmuter instead. So the actual protocol revenue includes 419M growing at like 13.18% which is another 55.224M. It\u2019s debatable but I think it\u2019s likely that if the transmuter treasury becomes much larger than the ALCX market cap they\u2019ll patch something in to siphon funds to the DAO eventually. Either way given my criteria I do include this number as protocol revenue.\n\nAssuming DAI rates hold this gives us a total revenue of 55.224M + 7.3M = 62.524M\n\nMarket cap: 345M\n\n**PE before debasement: 5.5**\n\nNow, onto [issuance](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/alchemix-finance/token-distribution/alcx-monetary-policy).\n\n>Approximately 22,344 ALCX tokens will be distributed from Staking Pools in week one of staking, and the amount will decrease by approximately 130 ALCX per week for three years. Because ALCX rewards are calculated per block, network conditions could slightly affect the emission schedule, but the effect should be negligible. After three years, there will be a flat 2200 ALCX weekly emission, increasing the total supply by 114,400 ALCX annually. At the three year point, there will be approximately 4.5% annual inflation of supply, and it will gradually decrease over time.\n\nWeek one of staking started Feb 28\u2019th which was conveniently a Sunday. You can see the ALCX supply adjusting hourly on this [dashboard](https://duneanalytics.com/kabrony/alchemix_1). I\u2019ll also point out from that dashboard that the interest in the project is really taking off judging by the unique holders trend.\n\nSuffice to say, we\u2019re in the really steep part of the curve, issuance is very high, and ALCX is worth a lot. Like in the past 2 weeks there has been 37730 issued @ a current price of 1280 = 48M debasement cost. Basically they are incurring debt equal to their current protocol revenue every 3 weeks. Over the next year there will be another 929,302 ALCX distributed.\n\nTaking our revenue of 62.524M most of which primarily goes to defending the peg subtracting a debasement cost of 1.189B it\u2019s not even close. For ALCX to hold its current value they\u2019ll need to find people willing to buy or hold at least $1.127B ALCX in the next year. Suffice to say even if the protocol grows 10x with the launch of v2 it\u2019s still effectively in debt. It\u2019s no wonder the price has been falling right? **Only buy this token right now if you\u2019re like me and deeply believe in this project.** Otherwise just *use* the platform and give ALCX no thought.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As I\u2019m sure comes to no surprise to anyone: ALCX</p>\n\n<p>If you aren\u2019t already familiar with the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/n07d7x/daily_general_discussion_april_28_2021/gw888bp/\">Double Logris</a> or <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ncr6lf/daily_general_discussion_may_15_2021/gy88498/\">Transmuter Boost</a> I already wrote some explainers.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that some of the best information I have is from the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Y87CieUoaZc\">Bankless podcast</a> and their <a href=\"https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/\">governance forum</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At its core, the DAO makes money in exchange for providing platform insurance. This is similar to AAVE staking. The exact mechanisms of the insurance aren\u2019t out yet but what is known is the DAO makes profit by <a href=\"https://alchemixfi.medium.com/a-prelude-to-alchemixdao-c69fa9b0bb30\">skimming yearn harvests</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we harvest the yield, we take a 10% cut which goes to the treasury, and yearn pays us affiliate fees for adding TVL to their protocol. When Alchemix v2 is released later this year, we will add multiple collateral types for alUSD, including USDC and USDT. We will also add more al-Assets, such as alETH and alBTC. Each of these vaults will have the same 10% fee applied to harvests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Y87CieUoaZc?t=3477\">Scroopy says</a> they\u2019re pulling in 10-20k a day plus a 30% affiliate fee. If we just take that 20k number at face value we would get profit of 3.65-7.3M which is definitely on the low end for a protocol worth 345M and implies a PE of 47.35 but let\u2019s have a look at how to derive this number ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the <a href=\"https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/alchemix-harvests-Mza34X\">dashboard</a> they use. It is surprisingly spiky. It is showing growth but his 20k estimate isn\u2019t unreasonable so I\u2019ll stick with it for now.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.yfistats.com/financials/financials.html\">here\u2019s</a> the best analytics I\u2019ve been able to find on yearn.

As such, I think we might stumble around here before dusting ourselves off and going back up. </p>\n\n<p>Who knows how long that\u2019ll take, but looking at the daily timeframe on ETHUSD shows some pretty scary stuff. Rn we\u2019re resting at just a bit below the par value of MA. I\u2019m seeing a bottom bollinger of around 2600, rn on a downtrend MACD looks p scary too got a long time before a crossover is in sight. Hopefully we don\u2019t get anywhere close to that bottom bollinger band but I am overall confident over the rest of the year but the next few weeks/month might be a little scary.
