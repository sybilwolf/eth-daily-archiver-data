The tamper mesh that JT mentioned is a 3d maze of electrical traces encasing all the secure components of the device.

This is where the secure screen comes into play - you need to carefully verify that what you're signing matches what MetaMask says you are signing. Not easy with a tiny screen and trying to click through tons of times before your tx times out. This still requires diligence on the part of the user, but the point of the hardware wallet is keeping you secure even when your phone or computer are compromised.
