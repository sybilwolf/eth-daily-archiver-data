The pullbacks are coming, prepare yourself mentally - whether that mean selling a little, all, none, etc.\n\n>Also: Do not leverage.

I sold the last chunk of my eth at $2.9k on the way up, and have been beating myself up about not selling higher.

Stablecoins solve the volatility\nproblem by pegging to a national currency, typically the US dollar, and are used as vehicles for\nexchanging national currencies into non-stable cryptocurrencies, with some stablecoins having a\nratio of trading volume to outstanding supply exceeding one daily. Using a rich dataset of signed\ntrades and order books on multiple exchanges, we examine how peg-sustaining arbitrage\nstabilizes the price of the largest stablecoin, Tether. We find that stablecoin issuance, the closest\nanalogue to central-bank intervention, plays only a limited role in stabilization, pointing instead\nto stabilizing forces on the demand side. Following Tether's introduction to the Ethereum\nblockchain in 2019, we find increased investor access to arbitrage trades, and a decline in\narbitrage spreads from 70 to 30 basis points. We also pin down which fundamentals drive the\ntwo-sided distribution of peg-price deviations: Premiums are due to stablecoins' role as a safe\nhaven, exhibiting, for example, premiums greater than 100 basis points during the COVID-19\ncrisis of March 2020; discounts derive from liquidity effects and collateral concerns.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis paper examined the efficiency and mechanisms of how stablecoins work in the digitalasset economy. Two fundamental questions were addressed. First, how does price stabilization\nfunction in the case of stablecoins and does this process differ from the supply-driven (i.e.,\ncentral-bank-intervention-driven) process that applies when national currencies are pegged to\none another? Second, what fundamentals account empirically for the premiums and discounts\nthat open up in Tether and other stablecoin markets?\nWe develop a model both to clarify the channels through which stablecoin premiums and\ndiscounts can arise and to provide other testable implications. A representative investor can\nuse dollars, stablecoins, or both as vehicle currencies through which they invest in a non-stable\ncryptoasset (e.g., Bitcoin). Stable-coin premiums can arise in the model due to relatively\nlow intermediation costs, which accords with actual market conditions since stablecoins use\nblockchains. Stablecoin premiums can also arise in the model by providing a hedge for nonstable cryptoassets. An arbitrage mechanism stabilizes the stablecoin price around the peg: in\nresponse to a deviation from the peg, the investor has an incentive to buy (sell) Tether from\nthe primary market issuer at a one-for-one rate and sell (buy) Tether in the secondary market\nwhen that price trades above (below) parity.

You'd have to \"worry\" about rai's price falling too low if you were holding spot rai without holding any rai-denominated debt.  That would be a fairly unusual occurrence now, and by the time that this isn't an unusual occurrence (as is the case with dai) the stability of rai against its arbitrary peg should be much more robust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>is the idea that it can leave the imaginary peg if it needs to? and i guess either increase or decrease depending on what?\n\nDepending on the PID (in this case specifically the relationship between redemption price and market price.  A good analogy is your air conditioning system.  You tell your system that you'd like your temperature to be some arbitrary level, right?  Ok, so when you open all your windows and the temp rises the ac kicks on -- and blows air a lot colder than your preferred final temperature.  The AC continues to blow much colder air until the proper net level of total air reaches closer to where you've set.   At that point the AC starts working less hard.\n\nIn this analogy the outside air temp is the market price for rai, which fluctuates for a variety of reasons, but generally for increases/decreases in demand for collateralization of Ethereum.

Well to incentivize the market price to move closer to the system price.  \n\nHow?  Well, if I hold rai-denominated debt and I see that the system price will be moving up, I am incentivized to go find Rai at the market, buy it and pay down my rai debt before it becomes more expensive.  My action of buying rai pushes the price of rai up, leading to a convergence of market price and system price.  Of course, the reverse of this is also true (I could generate debt and sell it for more than I generated it for).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>the arbitrary peg of 3.14 was chosen to start with but now it hovers around 3.00, is there a reason for this?\n\nSure, if you understand the above you'd expect the price of rai to be a \"random walk\" with a clear bias towards its best fit line.

With options you know what you can lose; just the premium you're paying for the *option* to sell or pay for X shares at a later date at an agreed price. \n\nIf you're buying **put** options you're buying the right to sell a stock at a given price, hoping that the market price will be lower than the price you're paying premiums to option. This is often referred to incorrectly as a kind of \"short\" and it isn't. You're betting that the stock will go down, but that's the end of the similarity. \n\nSay I buy 1000 put options at $500 in three months against X ticker which is currently at $700. In three months that ticker is now at $300. I can exercise the option and sell 1000 shares for 500 each. I don't need the stock at the time of the purchase of the premium, just when I exercise the option. So if it's trading at $300 and I've bought options for 1000, only then do you \"need the cash\" and that's just to settle:  you end up with your cash back and profits\n\nThe opposite of a put is a **call**. You're again, buying an option at a premium, but in this instance you're setting a price you'll pay for X shares at a given date, which is perhaps higher than it is now but lower than what you expect it will be at. \n\nYou buy 1000 options to purchase a stock at $500 in 3 months, and in 3 months it's suddenly at $1500. Awesome, you can now purchase 1000 shares at 500 a piece, and they're instantly market value: 1.5 million. Again, if the time hits and you're not making profit by exercising the option, you've got no obligation to buy. You're just out the premium. \n\nIn this way you can actually make a lot more than a cash on hand accounting, while only risking the premium cost, which is going to be a percentage of the price, based on a variety of factors. \n\nThat's what you have to be able to afford to lose. Gains can be much higher though, as if it comes to the point of a successful option for some amount of shares you can't directly buy with cash, well its easy to secure a loan for it: there's no risk. You have bought that option, you're just exercising it. If it's worth exercising then you can pay the loan back as soon as the sale clears.\n\n\nThe drawback here is premiums are like rent, they simply vanish. This makes them long term blackjack hands, really: you can pay those premiums for months waiting and if it never happens, you're getting nothing back. You aren't really storing any value or assets, you're either winning the bet or losing the premium. The wins might offset the losses if you can pick 'em, but it is much more akin to placing a bet than actually buying and selling stock.\n\nMy take, if you're \"just gonna play around with a hundred bucks or so\" and aren't taking the market seriously, fuck it man, buy options. You stand to lose your money but with that kind of mentality you should already be ready for that. \n\nOtherwise you ought to be looking to index and etfs, long holdings, and treating it like a retirement account. Not a gamble. Hundred bucks a month into the account and you don't ever want to touch it.

Even back then I said we could go back to 3k which is exactly whats happening (even though I didnt really expect it to happen to be honest), but I dont see it crashing more right now. This dip is already the heaviest in this cycle and this cycle has been nice to us compared to the other ones. Before the dips hardly broke 25%, this time we are closer to the \"usual\" 33% we saw in the last cycles.- That being said I think breaking 3k/40k was \"important\" to shake out weak hands and to (hopefully) establish both 3k and 40k as support for the future.\n\n\\- I think ETH will recover faster, because of both EIP 1559 and the overall development in the ecosystem. It sure looks like defi summer is on its way, mostly driven by defi protocols on L2 (e.g. AAVE on Matic - and yes, I know, people dont see Matic as L2, but lets just assume it is - right now, but there will be so much more to come, UNI, etc.)\n\n\\- L2 in general will push things further and give ETH a boost over BTC.\n\n\\- BTC nevertheless will have its moment. I dont know what will drive the run, but something is gonna happen. Someone on twitter (cant find the tweet) basically said \"a few months ago BTC was digital gold and a paradigm shift and a moments later its not worth shit anymore?\".

Even back then I said we could go back to 3k which is exactly whats happening (even though I didnt really expect it to happen to be honest), but I dont see it crashing more right now. This dip is already the heaviest in this cycle and this cycle has been nice to us compared to the other ones. Before the dips hardly broke 25%, this time we are closer to the &quot;usual&quot; 33% we saw in the last cycles.- That being said I think breaking 3k/40k was &quot;important&quot; to shake out weak hands and to (hopefully) establish both 3k and 40k as support for the future.</p>\n\n<p>- I think ETH will recover faster, because of both EIP 1559 and the overall development in the ecosystem. It sure looks like defi summer is on its way, mostly driven by defi protocols on L2 (e.g. AAVE on Matic - and yes, I know, people dont see Matic as L2, but lets just assume it is - right now, but there will be so much more to come, UNI, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>- L2 in general will push things further and give ETH a boost over BTC.</p>\n\n<p>- BTC nevertheless will have its moment. I dont know what will drive the run, but something is gonna happen. Someone on twitter (cant find the tweet) basically said &quot;a few months ago BTC was digital gold and a paradigm shift and a moments later its not worth shit anymore?&quot;.
