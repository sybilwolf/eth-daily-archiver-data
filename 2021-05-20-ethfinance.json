Maybe all of this is already obvious for all of you, but it never clicked like this in my own mind.\n\nSo I read in this thread that in the last 24h hours, about 3 times more fees were spent than the block reward. Seeing as these fees go to the miners and miners generally spend their Eth, this adds a lot of selling pressure to an already falling price.\n\nSo the way I see it, any high pressure panic event like yesterday becomes even worse for the Eth price, because of all the fees going into the miners hands adds sell pressure. I have heard there is a waiting period for miners to spend it (how long is this?), but even if that's true, there will be enough players and arbitrage bots to price this event in as it happens. Can this be part of the reason that Eth generally falls lower than Bitcoin, because of the added sell pressure?\n\nIf what I'm writing here is correct, I'm even more bullish on EIP1559 as before, because it will massively change the sell pressure:\n\n1. Right now, all of the fees directly **add** to sell pressure.\n2. After EIP 1559 all of the fees directly **substract** from the sell pressure.\n\nA day like yesterday would literally shift from adding 3 times block reward to **sell** pressure, to adding 3 times block reward to **buy** pressure. A net shift of 6 times the block reward.\n\nTwo conclusions:\n\n1. Because the price is determined only by supply and demand, or sell pressure and buy pressure, and EIP1559 makes such a potential drastic change in these forces, i'm not sure this could ever be priced in.\n2. If we assume that panic events will always have high gas prices, this will make Eth a highly stable store of value. The more congestion on the network, the more buying pressure for Eth. This will stabilize Eth into dropping less than btc instead of more than btc.Right now, the only thing Bitcoin has going for it, is that it's the most stable of the coins. If people and institutions start noticing that Eth will take this place, flippening is inevitable\n\nEdit:\n\nA flaw of my reasoning was pointed out by a question of u/I_LOVE_MOM, The buy pressure from having to buy fees obviously already exists, so there will not be anything new there. The only thing that changes is the sell pressure, so a net shift of 3 times the block reward. Furthermore, there will still be miners tip that will also increase when the network is congested, so there will be some sell pressure left.\n\nBoth of my conclusions still stand, but to a lesser extent. It already felt too good to be true haha","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have just been thinking about all the fees that were spent yesterday. Maybe all of this is already obvious for all of you, but it never clicked like this in my own mind.</p>\n\n<p>So I read in this thread that in the last 24h hours, about 3 times more fees were spent than the block reward. Seeing as these fees go to the miners and miners generally spend their Eth, this adds a lot of selling pressure to an already falling price.</p>\n\n<p>So the way I see it, any high pressure panic event like yesterday becomes even worse for the Eth price, because of all the fees going into the miners hands adds sell pressure. I have heard there is a waiting period for miners to spend it (how long is this?), but even if that&#39;s true, there will be enough players and arbitrage bots to price this event in as it happens. Can this be part of the reason that Eth generally falls lower than Bitcoin, because of the added sell pressure?</p>\n\n<p>If what I&#39;m writing here is correct, I&#39;m even more bullish on EIP1559 as before, because it will massively change the sell pressure:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Right now, all of the fees directly <strong>add</strong> to sell pressure.</li>\n<li>After EIP 1559 all of the fees directly <strong>substract</strong> from the sell pressure.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A day like yesterday would literally shift from adding 3 times block reward to <strong>sell</strong> pressure, to adding 3 times block reward to <strong>buy</strong> pressure. A net shift of 6 times the block reward.</p>\n\n<p>Two conclusions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Because the price is determined only by supply and demand, or sell pressure and buy pressure, and EIP1559 makes such a potential drastic change in these forces, i&#39;m not sure this could ever be priced in.</li>\n<li>If we assume that panic events will always have high gas prices, this will make Eth a highly stable store of value. The more congestion on the network, the more buying pressure for Eth. This will stabilize Eth into dropping less than btc instead of more than btc.Right now, the only thing Bitcoin has going for it, is that it&#39;s the most stable of the coins. If people and institutions start noticing that Eth will take this place, flippening is inevitable</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>A flaw of my reasoning was pointed out by a question of <a href=\"/u/I_LOVE_MOM\">u/I_LOVE_MOM</a>, The buy pressure from having to buy fees obviously already exists, so there will not be anything new there. The only thing that changes is the sell pressure, so a net shift of 3 times the block reward. Furthermore, there will still be miners tip that will also increase when the network is congested, so there will be some sell pressure left.</p>\n\n<p>Both of my conclusions still stand, but to a lesser extent. It already felt too good to be true haha</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-19 23:49:46","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-05-20 00:23:51","id":"gysmvcn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ngra7o","parent_id":"t3_ngra7o","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/I_LOVE_MOM","body":"Mostly agreed on sell pressure, though there will still be miner tip.

Then you have the error on the top, let&#39;s say the range on that is 10-15k.  That gives a range on the bottom of $1-3k.

Well, actually that&#39;s not right, I would say I think a multi chain future might happen but the vast majority of money will still be on one chain. Like everyone here I think that chain is ETH. I&#39;m also not sure if L2s count as part of Ethereum or if they count as a separate chain, but even if L2s become like separate chains with their own economy, ETH will still probably be way ahead of them in terms of market cap since pretty much every L2 needs it for security. </p>\n\n<p>If we look historically, it seems like one coin usually emerges as a clear winner, getting the vast majority of liquidity and activity. For example Bitcoin is the clear winner right now in the SoV space, there are coins such as Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin which have once challenged BTC but failed and now are pretty much irrelevant. Despite having some technical advances over Bitcoin, no one uses these coins pretty much.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-20 11:34:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gyuq8tm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ngra7o","parent_id":"t1_gyunxcr","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/CanWeTalkEth","body":"> There is real adoption happening in other places too\n\nI know if you said it yourself, I'd call it shilling.
