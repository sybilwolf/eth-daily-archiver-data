Literally the only time where we dropped steeply, wicked up sharply, and then dropped again but not quite as far was March 12, 2020. </p>\n\n<p>Everyone was just as gloomy that week as they are today, but there was actual serious negative news: there was a fucking global pandemic threatening the world economy. Today we have some weak-ass China FUD and some ambiguous tweets. It\u2019s nothing in comparison. </p>\n\n<p>I remember vividly what happened last March. I sold some ETH for the first time since the DAO hack that day thinking I\u2019d buy back in when it went lower. You know how that turned out: it never went lower, and I had to buy back at higher prices. </p>\n\n<p>Could it go lower? Sure, maybe. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely. We are clearly in a recovery from the drop on Wednesday, and after two tries the market hasn\u2019t been able to bust down any further. That\u2019s what market bottoms look like.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-21 17:59:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gz0ah4y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nhkhwb","parent_id":"t3_nhkhwb","score":57,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCuriousMan","body":"Agree, and appreciate this quality post.

Time for some unexpected and uncomfortable self-reflection:\n\n* **Ethereum doesn't need Bitcoin to survive.** Stop with the whole narrative that a healthy Bitcoin creates a healthy Ethereum. - This isn't 2017 anymore and at this point it is only a thing because people let it be one. Once Ethereum flips Bitcoin it won't matter beyond daily trading trends. And from a non-price perspective Bitcoin is basically noise. This is something that is true at this moment but is absolutely not true long term.\n* **Stop acting like Bitcoin isn't our competitor.** This one baffles me to no end. Ethereum can do everything Bitcoin can. ETH can be sent wallet to wallet, BTC can be sent wallet to wallet. Just because Bitcoin made up some \"Store of Value\" narrative and just because Ethereum does more beyond BTC's capabilities doesn't exclude it from being compared. It's such an easy way for Bitcoin to squeak out of critique that I almost think its some secret type of Bitcoin narrative they push. And frankly it's a disservice to what the devs have accomplished. This is just giving BTC a cop-out for not continually progressing.\n* **Bitcoin isn't diversification.** Tons of Ethereum investors feel the need to keep 20% of the stack in BTC just in case, yet not many Bitcoiners do so. That seems to be shifting (and see what happens to the Ratio when it does, *hint hint*). But owning some of each for 'diversification' is just pointless. Both move relatively in tandem and as we saw 3 days ago this whole market can tank together. Diversification is moving into property, traditional investments, mutual funds, so on... not splitting your money between two assets that both went up 1000% in a year. There is no investment reason to think you need to keep some token split of the two if you believe in Ethereum long term.

Time for some unexpected and uncomfortable self-reflection:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereum doesn&#39;t need Bitcoin to survive.</strong> Stop with the whole narrative that a healthy Bitcoin creates a healthy Ethereum. - This isn&#39;t 2017 anymore and at this point it is only a thing because people let it be one. Once Ethereum flips Bitcoin it won&#39;t matter beyond daily trading trends. And from a non-price perspective Bitcoin is basically noise. This is something that is true at this moment but is absolutely not true long term.</li>\n<li><strong>Stop acting like Bitcoin isn&#39;t our competitor.</strong> This one baffles me to no end. Ethereum can do everything Bitcoin can. ETH can be sent wallet to wallet, BTC can be sent wallet to wallet. Just because Bitcoin made up some &quot;Store of Value&quot; narrative and just because Ethereum does more beyond BTC&#39;s capabilities doesn&#39;t exclude it from being compared. It&#39;s such an easy way for Bitcoin to squeak out of critique that I almost think its some secret type of Bitcoin narrative they push. And frankly it&#39;s a disservice to what the devs have accomplished. This is just giving BTC a cop-out for not continually progressing.</li>\n<li><strong>Bitcoin isn&#39;t diversification.</strong> Tons of Ethereum investors feel the need to keep 20% of the stack in BTC just in case, yet not many Bitcoiners do so. That seems to be shifting (and see what happens to the Ratio when it does, <em>hint hint</em>). But owning some of each for &#39;diversification&#39; is just pointless. Both move relatively in tandem and as we saw 3 days ago this whole market can tank together. Diversification is moving into property, traditional investments, mutual funds, so on... not splitting your money between two assets that both went up 1000% in a year. There is no investment reason to think you need to keep some token split of the two if you believe in Ethereum long term. Mental reasons, truly believing in both projects... sure, but if you have a token amount of BTC because you feel obligated its pointless.</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#39;t defend BTC for the environmental FUD (and other</strong> <strong><em>truthful</em></strong> <strong>FUD) slung at it.</strong> Just stop, please. The narrative that Bitcoin is bad for the environment is an absolute godsend for Ethereum.

I followed the price of BTC since around 2014ish and was curious about it but never had the $ to invest, so when the time came to invest, I knew exactly what I wanted. Per mere coincidence I came across an article about ETH in 2016 with a little interactive tool that let you build smart contracts. I thought \u201cwoah that\u2019s cool, surely BTC can do that (or they are working on it),\u201d only to find BTC could not. Then I became obsessed with learning about Ethereum, started with the white papers, some Vitalik interviews, and ended with MakerDao, Augur and a Eth2.0 roadmap. \n\nSomething clicked. This is what blockchain is about, decentralization and bringing some power/visibility back to the people. \n\nI went all in on ETH in 2017 at the top of the bull market, wasn\u2019t a lot, but relative to me it was almost everything. Shortly after the price dropped and I was down a lot. I decided price was low and I should open a CDP (Vault) in MakerDao since I though the price would go up. Made the mistake of putting almost all my Eth into the CDP and paid the price. I was aggressively taking loans out to myself to buy more Eth and then adding back into the CDP (thought I was a genius). One day in late 2018  Eth just starts dropping to $ amounts I never though possible( or planned for).

I followed the price of BTC since around 2014ish and was curious about it but never had the $ to invest, so when the time came to invest, I knew exactly what I wanted. Per mere coincidence I came across an article about ETH in 2016 with a little interactive tool that let you build smart contracts. I thought \u201cwoah that\u2019s cool, surely BTC can do that (or they are working on it),\u201d only to find BTC could not. Then I became obsessed with learning about Ethereum, started with the white papers, some Vitalik interviews, and ended with MakerDao, Augur and a Eth2.0 roadmap. </p>\n\n<p>Something clicked. This is what blockchain is about, decentralization and bringing some power/visibility back to the people. </p>\n\n<p>I went all in on ETH in 2017 at the top of the bull market, wasn\u2019t a lot, but relative to me it was almost everything. Shortly after the price dropped and I was down a lot. I decided price was low and I should open a CDP (Vault) in MakerDao since I though the price would go up. Made the mistake of putting almost all my Eth into the CDP and paid the price. I was aggressively taking loans out to myself to buy more Eth and then adding back into the CDP (thought I was a genius). One day in late 2018  Eth just starts dropping to $ amounts I never though possible( or planned for). Being over leveraged and not having cash on hand to back up my CDP I was liquidated and my heart was broken. </p>\n\n<p>Being liquidated was the best thing to happen to me.

Then as we get towards the end of the year that base provided by the narrative + accumulation and a steady rise back up will be used as the launch platform to push things more parabolic as the ETH2 merge approaches and we start hearing all sorts of talk about the flippening to get retail investors to pile into the &quot;new hot thing&quot;. Everyone will be talking about staking at parties, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Also thanks for the Soros link, it&#39;s really interesting!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-21 15:10:04","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-05-21 15:13:55","id":"gyzrjr0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nhkhwb","parent_id":"t1_gyzk5ax","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"Yeah I pretty much agree.

So taking Chinese hash power out of the equation actually could be considered to make the chain more secure, not less, inasmuch as the Nakamoto number might actually go up.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if all those newly-useless-in-China ASICS were allowed to be sold internationally, you might wind up with an interesting situation down the line. But I doubt any one entity would be able to afford enough of them to 51%.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-21 12:23:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gyz6qlq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nhkhwb","parent_id":"t1_gyz4ym9","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Lol.
