Ah, how time flies! Yet it feels so cyclical, doesn't it? Most of you must be scared right now. I'm here to let you know: **it will be fine.** Price goes up, price goes down, but the amount of crypto you hold is forever. A few years onwards, these tokens you hold will be invaluable. They may be worth millions. No: they **will** eventually be. Take care of them. Don't let the market take them away from you. For all we know, the price could recover in a matter of hours, and if you're short, you'll never again have the same amount of tokens. You'll be forever disappointed with yourself, thinking how things could've been. So take care of these precious tokens. They're yours, and one day you'll be proud of that.

Not only because it is still, technically, early in the cycle. Not only because every past run reached higher peaks historically, and it would be, simply, strange for it to end right now. But overall, it doesn't feel like the interest is over. The opposite of love isn't hate, it is indifference. The end of a bull run isn't panic, is the end of interest. To me, this feels more like a temporary panic than a legit loss of interest. Everyone is watching the charts right now, waiting for a signal to jump in. Aren't you?\n\nI could be wrong, though, and this could be it. This run could be over. In this case, what happens? Crypto won't die, that I can say.

Money is printed, gold is mined, companies come and go, but crypto is always scarce. It is a force beyond any human's control. How much will Ether be worth for a citizen of 2040, who sees the worldwide economy running on the Ethereum network?\n\nAs for today, you have two options: you can cut your losses and walk out with some cash that you'll use to buy a car, a Charizard card, or food you need to survive. Or you can move your crypto to a cold wallet and hold it for the next decade. What you're going to do is only up to you to decide. Your personal reasons may turn the balance one way or another. And that is ok. What I can say, though, is that I don't know anyone who became a millionaire for either selling or timing this market. But I know more than I can count who got there by just holding - including myself.\n\nIf you do decide to go, don't be sad.

Feel free to ignore this post if you're feeling chill (or are even happy!) right now.\n\nPart of my issue with this subreddit (and pretty much all crypto subreddits/social media) is that not much time is spent talking about actual money management strategies. We discuss technological innovation, TA, lambomoonboi memes, speculative visions of the future, and conspiracy theories about mainstream financial institutions/their behavior...\n\n... but conversations about things like *\"hey everyone, what should I do if this particular asset that I purchased increases in value by 45x over the next 8 months?\"* or *\"if I buy this other asset and its price decreases by over 50% in the first week that I have it, what are some good moves for me?\"* are immediately shouted down by the hodlganghodlganghodlgang.\n\nThen, when price action like what we're seeing right now occurs, the majority of the community acts like a deer in headlights & is completely unable to make any moves at all to preserve their capital before getting obliterated by the danger that they knew was coming.\n\nWhat very few people talk about is that there *are* good answers to these questions out there. What you should do at any given moment depends entirely upon the context of your own personal life. If you have absolutely no more money to buy any crypto if the price tanks by 50% and if your heart flutters/panic sets in when you open whatever app that you use to check your crypto prices - it may be time to ask yourself \"the 50% question.\"\n\n*How would you feel if you converted 50% of your position into cash right now?* \n\nThink about this question very seriously while you examine three possibilities:\n\n1.) You sell 50% and Eth goes sideways forever. No big deal, really.\n\n2.) You sell 50% and Eth crashes back to mid-triple digits. Do you still have faith in Eth? Congratulations, you can now use that money to buy cheaper Eth. Did you lose faith in Eth? Well, at least you protected some of your wealth.\n\n3.) You sell 50% and Eth immediately goes on a facemelting rally back to new all time highs. This would be emotionally rough, but watching the Eth that you still have go on that facemelting rally would still feel pretty good.\n\nThe reason that I'm saying this right now to the people who are dismayed is because *some people are actually very happy to see this price action right now.* They either weren't able to buy as much as they wanted because they weren't willing to dump their entire cash reserve into a facemelting bull run - or they actually sold a chunk of their stack during the run and are hoping to use that money to buy back in cheaper.\n\nYou always want to put yourself in a position where you can feel pretty good about the market moving in either direction for as long as possible. If you *only* want the market to go up and would be emotionally scarred by the price dropping over 50%, it would probably make sense to consider selling a bit so that you could be happy if the price drops.\n\nRealizing and truly accepting the fact that you are overinvested is a powerful thing. You have the capability to rebalance and change your entire perspective at any time.\n\nJust think about it like this - there are people out there hoping that the price of Eth drops to $500 or less before continuing back to all time highs. Could you be happy at all to see Eth below $1000? Are you positioned to take advantage of something like that if it happens?\n\nIf not, ask yourself the 50% question.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This post is for people who are very anxious right now, checking crypto prices with dread &amp; horror.

If you <em>only</em> want the market to go up and would be emotionally scarred by the price dropping over 50%, it would probably make sense to consider selling a bit so that you could be happy if the price drops.</p>\n\n<p>Realizing and truly accepting the fact that you are overinvested is a powerful thing. You have the capability to rebalance and change your entire perspective at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Just think about it like this - there are people out there hoping that the price of Eth drops to $500 or less before continuing back to all time highs. Could you be happy at all to see Eth below $1000? Are you positioned to take advantage of something like that if it happens?</p>\n\n<p>If not, ask yourself the 50% question.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-23 10:19:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gz6iq4v","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nj0gjv","parent_id":"t3_nj0gjv","score":45,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"To be fair this sub is pretty good at telling people to take profits.

No one can force you to use Bitcoin. For BTC, demand comes from people wanting it, generally for speculative purposes, but no one needs it. If you think it\u2019s a Ponzi you simply make sure you don\u2019t hold any or you could even actively short it. If enough people realise the price collapses. By contrast, Governments can and do force you to use fiat so there is guaranteed demand - you need it. You might think fiat is a Ponzi scheme but you have to keep participating. You have to pay taxes in fiat. You have to keep records of all your transactions, earnings, expenses in fiat.

If you think it\u2019s a Ponzi you simply make sure you don\u2019t hold any or you could even actively short it. If enough people realise the price collapses. By contrast, Governments can and do force you to use fiat so there is guaranteed demand - you need it. You might think fiat is a Ponzi scheme but you have to keep participating. You have to pay taxes in fiat. You have to keep records of all your transactions, earnings, expenses in fiat.

Not me since 2015, but the old saying \"don't bet against Bitcoin\" resonates with people who really like to make money more than anything. It's just natural greed and that's ok.  \n\nThere will come a time, I think, that people will just go for the right tech because it's the right things to do and actually vote for ETH by selling their Bitcoin for it.\n\nWe're all hipocrites when it comes to money. I'm sure lots of people hate war or combustion engines or deforestation, but we still like stocks in companies that make us money through blindly  giving our paychecks to our employer's pick for retirement plans.  (just an example)\n\nI sold all my BTC in 2015 in favor of a better way. I don't regret it one bit and I hope others do the same.

So they're selling asap and withdrawing in cny. \n\nThen there's the Chinese miners who have an unclear future as well, and many (not all) are selling the mined coins and equipment, for fear of an outright mining ban in the coming week\n\nIt was incredibly irresponsible from the Chinese leadership to issue a vague statement from the VP on Friday night without gradually providing a series of guidelines and then enforcement. Shock decisions like these throw the market into turmoil\n\nSo what next?

That is what this sub is for, no? Or is it just people posting their ridiculous hopes? Personally I think those numbers are so far detached from reality that I'm genuinely curious to see how people are going to react in a few years time.

If I'd taken friends seriously when they first told me about it, it would have been in 2011. Those were the infancy years.

You said 3-4k top for this cycle.. why didn't you just sell it all then, hey, smarty pants?\" And the answer to that would be \"That was simply my guess. Crypto is wildly unpredictable. Sure, things could keep running and go a lot higher and stay higher, or it could go higher as a blow off top and come back to reality, or maybe we're at the start of a bear market right now, and like 2018, people are just calling it a dip, and they haven't realized yet how much worse it can get.

No comparisons to Bitcoin please, saying ETH should be equal in marketcap, let's just focus specifically on Ethereum. What's the exact fair dollar amount for it right now? I'll save us both some time here, you can't give an answer, because you simply don't know. Nobody does. So we'll see where the rest of this goes.
