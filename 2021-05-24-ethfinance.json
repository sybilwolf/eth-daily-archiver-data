This is this week\u2019s ETHosphere Timeline update - many of the big things upcoming in Ethereum in one big consolidated list.\n\nClearly, the big news this week was/is the price action, with its potential negative influence on the the ALL-IMPORTANT [Hawaii 2022](https://superphiz.github.io/hawaii/) event/decision. Be fearful of dead cats, everyone. Not much change in the overall timeline, however which is somewhat comforting.\n\n**Protocol updates**\n\nThe mid-year upgrades [Altair](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/r1-aSk4tu#Altair) and [London / 1559](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40timbeiko%2Facd-update-003#London-) are both still on track. With Rayonism now wrapped up and the focus turning to the above upgrades, work on the Merge recedes into the background. Large range of opinions on the projected Merge launch date, ranging from [October](https://twitter.com/nethermindeth/status/1385699335355125766), to [the end of 2021](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/ethereum-is-about-six-months-away-4b0), through to [early 2022](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210522#The-Merge), but too early to be making any firm calls. I\u2019m taking the most optimistic view in this timeline until demonstrated otherwise.\n\n**Layer 2s**\n\nAll going to plan, optimistic rollups solution Arbitrum should be launching on mainnet [this week](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/wen-arbitrum-634969c14713) (28th), initially for devs. An insightful comparison of Optimism vs Arbitrum has been [posted here](https://twitter.com/krzKaczor/status/1395812308451004419) for those looking to understand this a bit more. Optimism now also has [a nifty integration](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/) with Etherscan so you can see block activity as it happens.\n\nMatter Labs\u2019 zk-rollup implementation zkSync has a two highly significant milestones coming up (targeting May), namely the launch of NFTs and swaps on mainnet v1, as well as their public testnet for EVM-capable zkSync v2. They\u2019ve [given an update](https://medium.com/matter-labs/keeping-funds-safe-a-3-factor-approach-to-security-in-zksync-2-0-a70b0f53f360) this week and similar mentions on Discord to assure us that these are all still landing soon, receiving full team focus! Further edit: [New post!](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-1-x-swaps-nfts-event-system-and-permissionless-token-listing-e126fcc04d61)\n\nIn other stuff, decentralised staking solution RocketPool has been fairly quiet of late, mainly due to to most of the team being off having babies\u2026 solid timing there ;) While that has been happening a new round of audits started last week. We still don\u2019t have a launch date, but it\u2019s edging closer. Shoutouts to u/Legitimate-Ship-4060 u/lifesmage and u/actuallymentor who have been posting [weekly project summaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketpool/comments/nh7t14/last_week_in_rocketpool_1016_may_2021/) to the under-utilised [RPL sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketpool/). Sliding the launch estimate back to July at this stage.\n\n\u2014\n\n**THE TIMELINE** \n\n~ Ethereum protocol upgrades / hardforks in **bold**.\n\n~ All dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.\n\n**Q2 (Apr-Jun) 2021**\n\n* 28 May - [Arbitrum optimistic rollups mainnet release](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/wen-arbitrum-634969c14713)\n\n* May - [Loopring 3.7 release](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/ethport-loopring-l1-l2-cex-8bb83c9032e3), to include L2 > L1 bridge (batches L1 transactions together and uses L2 to do the bulk of computation)\n\n* May - [zkSync 2 Public testnet](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-0-roadmap-update-zkevm-testnet-in-may-mainnet-in-august-379c66995021)\n\n* May - [zkSync 1.x NFT minting and transfers, as well as token swaps](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-0-roadmap-update-zkevm-testnet-in-may-mainnet-in-august-379c66995021)\n\n* 9 June - London / EIP-1559 on Ropsten testnet\n\n* 15 June - Go/no-go decision for [Hawaii 2022](https://superphiz.github.io/hawaii/)\n\n* 16 June - London / EIP-1559 on Goerli testnet\n\n* 23 June - London / EIP-1559 on Rinkeby testnet\n\n* June (but likely July) - [RocketPool live launch](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1).

I prefer projects that work off a fee system instead of introducing massive variables like a whole new token. Especially since I think these tokens inevitably compromise people's motivations as the lure of wealth is irresistible, so the incentive to alter tokenomics to make people money instead of securing the ecosystem is always there. Essentially I don't trust these teams to get the game theory right first try.\n\nGovernance tokens in general skeev me out these days. I think there is potential and that they'll be important in the future of this ecosystem, but today there are too many useless ones. Plus I've seen a few projects where governance is completely controlled by one or two whales. Doesn't always lead to more egalitarian systems.\n\nIdk, I'm probably just talking out my ass on this.

I prefer projects that work off a fee system instead of introducing massive variables like a whole new token.
