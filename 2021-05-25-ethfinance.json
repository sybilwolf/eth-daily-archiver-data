Peep an EIP is a good place to gain an understanding of specific EIPs on a technical level straight from the EIP authors themselves.</p>\n\n<p>This week&#39;s will be a Q&amp;A with Ethereum researcher Alex Stokes on the <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/HF1_proposal#Accounting-reform-tier-1\">accounting reform changes</a> included in the upcoming Altair hard fork. </p>\n\n<p>The call is scheduled for tomorrow, May 26 at 2:30 pm EST. There isn&#39;t a public Zoom link this time, although it will be posted shortly beforehand in the Cat Herders discord. I&#39;ll be participating, so if anyone has any questions they&#39;d like to be put to Alex on the proposal, or Altair, or maybe even the Ethereum roadmap in general, post them here or in the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/tzYmDmF\">Cat Herders discord</a> and they will be asked!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-25 06:34:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gze1g7b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nkhm3u","parent_id":"t3_nkhm3u","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/etherbie","body":"Thanks man.

An increase of roughly 1700%. 19640 x 17 gives us 333880, might be coincidence, but I'm starting to get a feeling that our BTC cycle top might be in these regions.\n\nWhat else: the BTC halvening in this cycle was exactly two months prior to the one in the last. The infamous drop in the 17 bull happened at the 16th of July, \"our\" at the 19th of May, almost exactly two months earlier in the year.\n\nIf we extrapolate all these numbers to this cycle we will see 330k BTC at the 20th October this year. This will be the cycle top. I'm really interested to see how close it'll come.\n\nWhat about ETH? Well, two things are noticeable: In the last bull ETH peaked 28 later than BTC, and in this run ETH reached its ATH 28 days later then BTC (14th of April, 12th of May). Ok, this is also settled then, ETH will reach its peak 17th of Nov (or at least close to it).\n\nNow, the price of ETH at this given date: If we assume that BTC behaves the same as in the last bull, its price will be around 225k at the date ETH will reach it's ATH. Back in Jan 18 when ETH hit its previous ATH the ratio was pretty much exactly at .1, so 22.5k would be the target price. This fits well into the narrative that ETH behaves similar to BTC in the last cycle but with a bit more strongly pronounced tops and bottoms.\n\nNow the question is what will the ratio do. .1 seems a bit low for me tbh, so a peak at 25k or even 30k is not out of the question (if the ratio behaves the same way, percentage wise, as in 2017 we will top out at 61k. But even for my taste this is way too bullish). The ratio is the big question mark for me in this whole story.\n\nSo, anyway, hope this rambling is somewhat intelligible, lots of numbers and extrapolations and the past doesn't predict the future and so on. But it is astonishing how similarly these both runs are developping.\n\nI guess the unforseen event was, that BTC smashes its former ATH at 20k with the first swing. At least I was very surprised by this and I guess I was not alone. This is now \"corrected\" and we can move on freely.\n\nAlso, there won't be a new paradigm in this run. You see the shitcoins, you see how fucking fast this market can change its direction still. It's still crypto how we know and love (or endure) it.\n\nEdit: You do not only want to have a date for exit but also for re-entry again, as everyone with half a brain knows, that the current FIAT system is doomed for failure (thanks for kicking out the gold standard, Thatcher). The lows of the following bear market are pretty much exactly a year after the cycle top. This gives us 1 year bull, 1 year bear and 2 years of crabbing with bulish hints.\n\nHowever, DCA, on the way in and on the way out. There are no guarantees (learned this the hard way when I had no funds to buy the Covid crash).\n\n2nd Edit: BTC just closed an 4h-candle below the 25 SMA. I'm not amused by this. Ah yes, important notice, I never have and never will own BTC. Imo this space is ETH or dust.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Due to my well received <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/njq0tz/daily_general_discussion_may_24_2021/gz982j2/\">comment</a> from yesterday, I decided to run some numbers.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned that a potential top from BTC might be around 330k due to the fact that the July drop 17 went from 1.8k and later on to 20k which would be the same as going from 30k to 330k percentage wise.</p>\n\n<p>Well guess what: The peak bubble price in late 13 was 1160, the one in late 17 19640.
