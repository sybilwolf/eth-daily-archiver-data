Those two videos will surely get your panties in a bunch and help you understand more.\n\nThere\u2019s levels to this shit and as a contract had more and more money like Aave or Compound, the honeypot becomes more lucrative.\n\nI don\u2019t see Stani and all his multisigs running off with money, neither do I see Leshner or his multisigs, or Prince and Blockfi, or Alex and Celsius.\n\nAlso I go on NXM and weigh risks by looking at rates. Its sorta like deciding how long my kid gets a car depending on what his insurance quote is. If he gets a high quote for coverage, he definitely isn\u2019t driving all day without some supervision. Stuff like that.\n\nImagine you\u2019re a hacker. You see a bug in Cream, how long will you wait to use this 0day? It\u2019s got 150mil, do you hack it? It\u2019s got 1bil, do you do it? At the same time you are thinking shit, what if someone else saw the 0day and does it before me? Stuff like that. When the honeypots get big enough, you start to realize it is pretty battle-tested.\n\nI don\u2019t stunt on roboczar but if he was doing insurance coverage, he would probably rate Binance in the same boat as CREAM. I would not.

The thing that stuck out most to me is that at any point someone can redeem LUSD for ETH. Which means if you mint LUSD you could potentially lose your collateral at any time. If an exploit is found that allows someone to mint unlimited LUSD they'll steal ETH equal to all outstanding loans. If the peg is below a dollar it creates an arbitrage loop where you can buy LUSD with a stablecoin, redeem ETH with it, and sell the ETH for your stablecoin. Even though there isn't a penalty to the minter on this redemption like there is if their collateralization falls below 110% it still counts as a taxable sale for the minter.
