I wonder how that works?). I have to say overall the mainstream crypto coverage has significantly improved over the last few years. However, I was still pretty shocked/angered by a complete false statement by a guest on the show, said with such conviction it was astonishing and likely convincing to a largely uninformed audience. In a nutshell, the whole segment was regarding the recent ransomware attacks on American companies and how crypto is largely responsible for it.\n\nI know many will say oh this doesn't matter, eventually they'll learn, who cares etc. Overall, I would agree with the sentiment that certain people will never be convinced, people will say look at old videos of the 1999 internet people saying the same thing, 1920's \"radiophobia\", they are just salty/upset they missed the boat etc. I understand we are on the precipice of a new frontier and people innately resistant at first to any large change. I have found that this fear and resistance to change is only overcome (over time) with information, research and hard facts.\n\nMy concern with this segment mainly roots from the inevitable regulation coming down the pipeline from government entities (some is much needed without a doubt). The level of misinformation out there with regard to crypto is astounding and overwhelming to the majority of people. Unfortunetely,  I can already see how the narrative regarding these ransomware attacks (likely just the beginning of negative crypto use narrative) is starting to be shaped, by a very misinformed majority. I know we have people like Hester Peirce with the SEC, who genuinely are open-minded and want to do the right thing to protect investors, but also do not want to stifle the potential innovation that cryptos represent and that this country (US) was built on. My whole point is that people like Hester Peirce are still in the minority and if enough pressure is built up by a largely uninformed public, through inaccurate narratives (i.e. no cryptos no ransomware attacks), that could possibly pressure legislators into taking a heavier handed approach to cryptos as a whole then if the public was more well informed about all the possible benefits of what cryptos and projects like Ethereum can bring to society. These are too many to list but think banking the unbanked, no true central point of authority power back to the individual, no real barriers to entry (no sophisticated investor restriction limiting access), transparency across the board without sacrificing security, etc. etc.\n\nOverall, one of the main benefits in my mind is the fact that we have lived in a society where financial transactions historically have are large component of \"trust\" built into them. As detailed throughout the years \"the few\" have taken advantage of this trust from \"the many\" to their own benefit time and time again. With cryptos, specifically Ethereum, this \"trust\" that has constantly been preyed upon is no longer a factor and rather we can utilize this new technology thorough smart contracts to remove middlemen and the component of \"trust\" that is easily abused throughout endless use cases. This is only possible with this new innovative technology. So when someone says there is no utility in crypto it definitely is a wildly incorrect statement. Although in the minority of cases such as the ransomware attacks, it can be scapegoated as the villain, however, that is missing the forest through the trees. Regarding cryptos role in ransomware attacks would be the equivalency of saying that we shouldn't use fiat currency, because it can be used for nefarious purposes, all while discounting the countless benefits and disregarding the issues that would arise reverting back to a society with no money as our accepted medium of exchange.\n\nMy objective of this post is simple, if we all really believe in a truly decentralized world, one of which is just beginning to be built on Ethereum, there is no next person that is going to stand up and share all the great and useful information that people that read a sub like ethfinance have. One of the main things I was originally drawn to with Ethereum, unlike many other cryptos out there, was that I never felt like I was being shilled or marketed an investment in it.

Really can't say that about a lot of the crypto space, but I considered myself very lucky that I stumbled upon Ethereum first out of all the other cryptos.\n\nEthereum itself does no real marketing, which is something I love about it. However, that puts the responsibility on each and every one of us to spread our knowledge to the public, as there is no real single entity out there marketing/informing the public about all the benefits to society/investors that Ethereum can provide, its up to you.

With Liquity and Maker you are taking a loan against the ETH capital you lock in the system. With Alchemix you are taking a loan against or an advance on the future yield on that capital. Thus there is no liquidation risk on your capital with Alchemix. Per my understanding of Alchemix, which is not expertise, you send your DAI (and in the future other collateral types) to their vault, your collateral is added to the pool with the rest of the users (plus more collateral from the transmuter mechanism) and it is deployed across DeFi yield strategies to earn yield. You are able to take a loan out against the projected future yield up to 50% of the collateral value (for DAI, ETH and other collateral types will likely be lower at least initially). Over time, as the yield accrues on this capital pool, that loan is paid back by the yield generated, and you are either able to unlock your collateral or utilize increased borrowing power. There are risks with Alchemix, the same with all DeFi protocols such as contract risk, a unique one would be if DeFi yields were to grind down to low rates (say from current ~15% to 1%) it could take many years for the protocol to pay down your loan. But you could always pay back your loaned alUSD and unlock your DAI. I have used Maker and Alchemix but have not used Liquity. I like alchemix as it is a relatively conservative strategy as in your capital is not at liquidation risk and am really looking forward to the Eth vault coming online in the near future.

They&#39;re still tagging him in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1400369804595318784\">tweets</a> for the past <em>four years</em> about how the coordinator will be removed any day now (tm)</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Architecturally, their probablistic &quot;tangle&quot; idea is interesting.  But I haven&#39;t seen any explanation of how they plan to solve state propagation / concurrency issues. These become harder to deal with the more state an average transaction has to touch. <em>(edit: working around this issue is where I think their &quot;coordinator&quot; comes in)</em> This also means smart contracts are gonna be a real pain, with all the state they can affect.  </p>\n\n<p>Personally I got scared away back at the beginning when they tried to implement their own cryptographic primitives in a custom trinary logic virtual machine.  Awesome CS undergrad thing to do while stoned in your dorm.  Less awesome if you&#39;re doing something you want taken seriously.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-03 06:10:48","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-06-03 06:30:20","id":"h0fof17","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nr5cic","parent_id":"t1_h0fn87h","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/18boro","body":"Thanks a bunch for taking your time to write this!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks a bunch for taking your time to write this!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-03 06:25:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h0fq8u5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nr5cic","parent_id":"t1_h0fof17","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"At this point any idea that isn't fully fleshed-out in advance of release isn't worth spending time or money on.\n\nWhitepapers that only serve to identify outstanding problems aren't really whitepapers at all.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>At this point any idea that isn&#39;t fully fleshed-out in advance of release isn&#39;t worth spending time or money on.</p>\n\n<p>Whitepapers that only serve to identify outstanding problems aren&#39;t really whitepapers at all.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-03 07:37:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h0g07mv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nr5cic","parent_id":"t1_h0fof17","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Rapidlysequencing","body":"\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-03 06:19:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h0fpiqm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nr5cic","parent_id":"t1_h0fof17","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/gamma001","body":"Pretty much still a shit show.
