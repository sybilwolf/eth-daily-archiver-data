Here's a compare and contrast of Convex and Yearn:\n\n1) Yearn has lower gas fees. Much lower. A deposit to yearn is like $4 right now, a deposit to Convex is about $20. If you're on the lower end of liquidity this probably matters. If gas spikes back to 100 gwei again this definitely matters.\n\n2) Yearn has higher management fees. The 2% management fee just takes 2% of your TVL every year. The 20% performance fee takes 20% of the profit you would get from doing it manually. By contrast Convex only has a 16% total fee, which is equivalent to a 0% management fee and a 16% performance fee. Most of this goes to the people providing CRV to give you your boost which is more than fair.\n\n3) Yearn has higher APR *for now*. There's some kind of anti-whale thing in Convex that makes the APR warm up over 7 days. We'll see where it ends up after 7 days but for now the Convex APR is like 15% and the Yearn APR is 41%.\n\n4) Yearn is more hands off. Yearn auto compounds your position. Convex makes you claim rewards and compound it yourself. This is both more hassle and a lot more gas (claim, trade 3 assets, deposit to curve, deposit to convex).\n\n5) Convex is paying out CVX tokens on top of the CRV and ALCX rewards you already get. After the 7 day pool warm up this may push the APR for Convex well above Yearn. Time will tell but there's every reason to suspect that Convex will eventually have the higher APR.\n\n6) Yearn is definitely the more established and therefore lower risk option. While Convex did have an audit, it's 1 audit that found multiple very bad bugs. Yearn has been around much longer and the pot for hacking it is still sweeter so I put more faith in its security at the moment.\n\nPersonally I'd just recommend using Yearn for now at least until the Convex APR finishes warming up. After that if the Convex APR is like 10% more than Yearn it might be worth it if you are investing like 100k. For smaller amounts I'd still recommend Yearn if that's the delta given all the costs of compounding the rewards yourself. Just the hassle of the time compounding it yourself, the gas costs, the tax implications of the trading, etc. Unless you're making several thousand a year more on Convex I'd just stick it in Yearn and call it good.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I split my alUSD farming efforts to try out Convex.
