It will not benefit citizens whatsoever, if anything be a detriment to them now that their rulers can be even more corrupt and unaccountable. President Bukele&#39;s buddies <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/el-salvador-presidents-allies-are-us-list-officials-deemed-corrupt-rcna954\">are corrupt scumbags as far as the US government is concerned.</a>. (pot and kettle I suppose but the point stands)</p>\n\n<p><em>Again and again and again</em> we see this same thing where there is some fluffy news like this that eventually leads to a simple fact: Bitcoin is a terrible currency and a broken, slow, expensive proof of concept L1 with weak, do-nothing developers now that nothing relevant can be built on. Lightning is a joke and so is Strike, none of that fixes these issues. </p>\n\n<p>This is some seriously some last gasp pathetic nonsense to keep Bitcoin relevant one more day while Ethereum and others eat it alive on all fronts, of course oozed out of a cringe conference of maxi tools that still peddle this fantasy about being grassroots and &quot;for the people&quot;, when the reality is BTC is has only kept consolidating and degrading into a cartel of rich morons itself.</p>\n\n<p>It will be a cold day in hell before you ever see BTC made &quot;legal tender&quot; in the US or EU to challenge the Dollar or Euro, so get that out of your head right now.</p>\n\n<p>**None of this is to say broad crypto adoption by countries as a reserve is impossible or anything. But, expecting central banks to just roll over without inserting their own systems and settlement they control is delusional also I think. Personally I think the future looks like decentralized stableDollars as the next reserve paradigm, which would probably take a whole other post to explain. BTC is just a gimmick as usual.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-06 08:41:14","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-06-06 09:50:52","id":"h0syzqw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nte138","parent_id":"t3_nte138","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/FlappySocks","body":"The US says a lot of things about other counties it doesn't like.\n\nIt's what the people of El Salvador think, is what matters.\n\nI agree Bitcoin is a bad choice.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The US says a lot of things about other counties it doesn&#39;t like.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s what the people of El Salvador think, is what matters.</p>\n\n<p>I agree Bitcoin is a bad choice.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-06 08:47:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h0szsw9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nte138","parent_id":"t1_h0syzqw","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"> It's what the people of El Salvador think, is what matters.\n\nWhat do they think?
