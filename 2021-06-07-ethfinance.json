And even people who aren\u2019t so\u00a0into it more or less accept that narrative. Barely a day goes by where we don\u2019t hear from some legendary investor opining on TV, saying something like,\u00a0\u201cWe believe Bitcoin is an emerging store of value, which, like gold, can play an important role in a diversified portfolio.\u201d\u00a0\n\nNobody even talks about how it\u2019s not used in day-to-day transactions. Or how it\u2019s too slow or too volatile to be a useful currency. That all may be true, but those are old talking points. By and large, the\u00a0[HODLer](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/what-the-heck-is-hodl-bitcoin-lingo-for-crypto-noobs-quicktake)\u00a0narrative has won.\n\nOf course, people still scoff at the idea that something so volatile\u00a0could possibly be considered a haven. After all, it\u2019s had numerous drawdowns of 50% or more, including quite recently.\n\nBut on the other hand, you have to give it some credit. A\u00a0nearly $1 trillion asset has been memed into existence, despite being backed by nothing.\n\n(This is where someone\u00a0jumps in and says\u00a0I\u2019m wrong, and that Bitcoin is backed by electricity and math!\u00a0But that\u00a0is wrong. The Bitcoin network is\u00a0secured\u00a0by electricity and math. Being secured is\u00a0not the same as being backed. You\u2019re not entitled to redeem your Bitcoin for anything.)\n\nThe fact of the matter is that there\u2019s nothing fundamentally underpinning the value of Bitcoin other than the belief among some people that space on the network is valuable. (The blockchain can be likened in some sense to a big, decentralized spreadsheet and a \u201ccoin\u201d could be said to represent some space on it.)\n\nI mentioned above that Bitcoin\u2019s value has been memed into existence. And of course, when it comes to memes and coins, people think about Dogecoin. But Bitcoin is also a memecoin. It\u2019s just that digital gold is probably one of the best memes out there.\n\nBitcoin also has plenty of absurd\u00a0memes, like the Magic Internet Money wizard.\n\nBitcoin shares other properties with gold, beyond just a good meme, though:\n\nBeyond holding, it\u2019s not used for much. Yes, you can make jewelry with gold. And it has some industrial properties. But for the most part, people hold gold as a financial asset.\n\nThere\u2019s no Saudi Arabia of gold (or Bitcoin). Both can be mined basically anywhere in the world. Unlike say, oil, no one place on Earth has an unusual bounty of access to it.\n\nBoth are energy-intensive and difficult to mine.\n\nGold\u2019s supply schedule isn\u2019t quite as absolute as Bitcoin, but barring a\u00a0gold asteroid hitting the Earth, the total amount of it out there is pretty predictable.\n\nBitcoin and gold both have mystical origins. Bitcoin has Satoshi (plus\u00a0[numerous other religious parallels](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/bitcoin-is-a-faith-based-asset-joe-weisenthal?sref=vuYGislZ)). Gold was viewed by the ancients as divine because it didn\u2019t tarnish.\n\nAgain, you can agree or disagree about Bitcoin\u2019s haven properties. But that\u2019s how more and more people see it and use it.\n\nDiverging Views\n\nOf course, differences of views have always been part of Bitcoin and crypto more broadly. Within Bitcoin, there have been numerous schisms about where it should go and how it should be used. And of course over time, tens of thousands of more coins have been launched, all with ostensibly different aims or goals.\n\nThe last really big Bitcoin battle was from 2015\u00a0to 2017\u00a0\u2014\u00a0[The Blocksize War](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Z18GWD6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0when one faction wanted to make a change in the code to make it more of a spending currency. Without getting too technical, there\u2019s a fairly hard limit to how many transactions the network can process\u00a0at the base layer, every second. Numerous miners, exchanges and other companies fought to make\u00a0base-layer transaction throughput faster and cheaper by expanding the size of each Bitcoin block.\n\nThat seems innocuous enough, but\u00a0if you\u2019re trying to be \u201cdigital gold\u201d, pushing through big changes is risky. Imagine\u00a0tweaking gold\u2019s atomic structure to make it even more shiny. That might look good, but then is it really still the same gold that people have trusted for thousands of years? More concretely, adding more capacity was seen by many in the community as a threat to the decentralization of the network.\n\nHow is more transaction capacity\u00a0a threat to decentralization? Well, one core tenet of the community is that anyone anywhere in the world should be able to run a full Bitcoin node, which can download and monitor the entire network. That way, any individual can verify independently what\u2019s going on, how many coins are out there, what transactions have been made, and so on. This can currently be done on basically any cheap computer right now. But if the base layer were to get too heavy (i.e., if too many transactions pile up), it might become prohibitive for anyone to download and watch, meaning only those with stronger computing capabilities could monitor it, thus limiting the breadth of the nodes.\u00a0\n\nIt should\u00a0be said that while this was a technical fight, there were also political elements, with suspicion on both sides that some players were attempting to control the network for their specific purposes. Anyway, in the end, Bitcoin basically stayed unchanged. Some tweaks were made, but nothing immediately drastic. In general, the core Bitcoin development philosophy is extremely conservative\u00a0and resistant to change. It\u2019s kind of the exact opposite of Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d ethos. It\u2019s not about constant iteration at all. Again, if your goal is to just be gold, this is probably sensible.\n\nOf course, there are people in the world who are drawn into Satoshi\u2019s breakthrough \u2014\u00a0which for the first time established the ability to create decentralized scarcity online \u2014\u00a0and who want to do more than just create something to hold. Some people want to\u00a0do\u00a0something with this technology. It\u2019s understandable to be honest.\u00a0\n\nOne of the people who wanted to do something with this technology was Vitalik Buterin, who published the\u00a0[Ethereum white paper in 2013](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/), arguing\u00a0that with some modifications, a blockchain could do so much more than just be a money database. His vision\u00a0included\u00a0serving as a repository for identities, decentralized file storage and\u00a0financial derivatives, among others. Basically a lot of what people are excited doing today with DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc. (all of which we\u2019ll get back to) were spelled out pretty explicitly in that paper.\n\nAnd it\u2019s here that we get to a real schism in the crypto world, one that\u2019s leading two very different ideas about what all this technology is actually for...\u00a0\n\nCryptocurrencies vs. Tokens\n\nThere is a sense in which both Bitcoin and Ethereum could both be described as the official currencies of two distinct digital tribes. A lot of people obviously own both currencies. And what you\u2019re about to read is a gross generalization. But there is something to it.\n\nBitcoiners tend to place a high value on adversarial thinking. Trust nobody. Did you buy your Bitcoin on an exchange? Get it off there immediately, and move it to your private wallet so that you don\u2019t have any counterparty risk. Run your own node so you can monitor the network directly. Over the last several months, Bitcoiners on Twitter have adopted the laser-eyes meme.\n\nAs the influencer Anthony \u201cPomp\u201d Pompliano\u00a0[put it recently](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1397592014426943493), it\u2019s \u201cBitcoiners vs. The World.\u201d Bitcoiners distrust banks. They\u00a0really\u00a0distrust central banks. Hardcore Bitcoiners say that you should treat everyone\u00a0[like they\u2019re a\u00a0scammer](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/everyones-a-scammer/#:~:text=And%20once%20you%20have%20fallen,willpower%20is%20your%20only%20defense.).\u00a0It\u2019s crucial to the Bitcoin project that Satoshi disappeared, because if he were still around then some people would trust his judgment.\u00a0Bitcoiners also eat a lot of meat. That\u2019s not really related to trust, it\u2019s just a distinct fact about the tribe. That\u2019s not universal by any stretch,\u00a0[but it is a thing](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ne74nw/inside-the-world-of-the-bitcoin-carnivores).\u00a0\n\nEthereans are different. Their founder is still alive and highly influential. Vitalik Buterin doesn\u2019t have laser eyes. But he has been photographed several times wearing T-shirts with kitties on them. Rather than eating meat,\u00a0[he eats a lot of coconut, dark chocolate, nuts\u00a0and avocados](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/895490413481541633). The biggest decentralized crypto exchange on Ethereum is called\u00a0[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), and it\u2019s got a whimsical unicorn-themed motif. No macho bro stuff. After Pomp\u2019s tweet about Bitcoiners vs. the world,\u00a0[some Ethereans](https://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1397657789351215104)\u00a0responded\u00a0saying their mission is to be\u00a0for\u00a0the world, not vs. the world. It\u2019s a different vibe all around.\n\nHere\u2019s a photo of Vitalik eating avocado toast wearing a T-shirt with kitties and rainbows on it. It captures it all pretty nicely.\n\n...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There\u2019s a New Vision for Crypto, and It\u2019s Wildly Different From Bitcoin</p>\n\n<p>The market is still treating the space as a monolith.\u00a0It\u2019s time for that to change.</p>\n\n<p>By\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AQ0VXvE12t0/joe-weisenthal\">Joe Weisenthal</a></p>\n\n<p>June 7, 2021, 4:00 AM EDT</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s kind of weird to say this, but after more than a decade of Bitcoin\u2019s existence, there\u2019s finally some consensus about what it is.</p>\n\n<p>Hardcore Bitcoiners liken it to \u201cdigital gold\u201d \u2014\u00a0a safe-haven\u00a0asset whose primary use case is holding.

Unlike say, oil, no one place on Earth has an unusual bounty of access to it.</p>\n\n<p>Both are energy-intensive and difficult to mine.</p>\n\n<p>Gold\u2019s supply schedule isn\u2019t quite as absolute as Bitcoin, but barring a\u00a0gold asteroid hitting the Earth, the total amount of it out there is pretty predictable.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin and gold both have mystical origins. Bitcoin has Satoshi (plus\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/bitcoin-is-a-faith-based-asset-joe-weisenthal?sref=vuYGislZ\">numerous other religious parallels</a>). Gold was viewed by the ancients as divine because it didn\u2019t tarnish.</p>\n\n<p>Again, you can agree or disagree about Bitcoin\u2019s haven properties. But that\u2019s how more and more people see it and use it.</p>\n\n<p>Diverging Views</p>\n\n<p>Of course, differences of views have always been part of Bitcoin and crypto more broadly. Within Bitcoin, there have been numerous schisms about where it should go and how it should be used. And of course over time, tens of thousands of more coins have been launched, all with ostensibly different aims or goals.</p>\n\n<p>The last really big Bitcoin battle was from 2015\u00a0to 2017\u00a0\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Z18GWD6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">The Blocksize War</a>\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0when one faction wanted to make a change in the code to make it more of a spending currency. Without getting too technical, there\u2019s a fairly hard limit to how many transactions the network can process\u00a0at the base layer, every second. Numerous miners, exchanges and other companies fought to make\u00a0base-layer transaction throughput faster and cheaper by expanding the size of each Bitcoin block.</p>\n\n<p>That seems innocuous enough, but\u00a0if you\u2019re trying to be \u201cdigital gold\u201d, pushing through big changes is risky. Imagine\u00a0tweaking gold\u2019s atomic structure to make it even more shiny. That might look good, but then is it really still the same gold that people have trusted for thousands of years? More concretely, adding more capacity was seen by many in the community as a threat to the decentralization of the network.</p>\n\n<p>How is more transaction capacity\u00a0a threat to decentralization? Well, one core tenet of the community is that anyone anywhere in the world should be able to run a full Bitcoin node, which can download and monitor the entire network. That way, any individual can verify independently what\u2019s going on, how many coins are out there, what transactions have been made, and so on. This can currently be done on basically any cheap computer right now. But if the base layer were to get too heavy (i.e., if too many transactions pile up), it might become prohibitive for anyone to download and watch, meaning only those with stronger computing capabilities could monitor it, thus limiting the breadth of the nodes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It should\u00a0be said that while this was a technical fight, there were also political elements, with suspicion on both sides that some players were attempting to control the network for their specific purposes. Anyway, in the end, Bitcoin basically stayed unchanged. Some tweaks were made, but nothing immediately drastic. In general, the core Bitcoin development philosophy is extremely conservative\u00a0and resistant to change. It\u2019s kind of the exact opposite of Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d ethos. It\u2019s not about constant iteration at all. Again, if your goal is to just be gold, this is probably sensible.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are people in the world who are drawn into Satoshi\u2019s breakthrough \u2014\u00a0which for the first time established the ability to create decentralized scarcity online \u2014\u00a0and who want to do more than just create something to hold. Some people want to\u00a0do\u00a0something with this technology. It\u2019s understandable to be honest.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>One of the people who wanted to do something with this technology was Vitalik Buterin, who published the\u00a0<a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/\">Ethereum white paper in 2013</a>, arguing\u00a0that with some modifications, a blockchain could do so much more than just be a money database. His vision\u00a0included\u00a0serving as a repository for identities, decentralized file storage and\u00a0financial derivatives, among others. Basically a lot of what people are excited doing today with DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc. (all of which we\u2019ll get back to) were spelled out pretty explicitly in that paper.</p>\n\n<p>And it\u2019s here that we get to a real schism in the crypto world, one that\u2019s leading two very different ideas about what all this technology is actually for...\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Cryptocurrencies vs. Tokens</p>\n\n<p>There is a sense in which both Bitcoin and Ethereum could both be described as the official currencies of two distinct digital tribes. A lot of people obviously own both currencies. And what you\u2019re about to read is a gross generalization. But there is something to it.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoiners tend to place a high value on adversarial thinking. Trust nobody. Did you buy your Bitcoin on an exchange? Get it off there immediately, and move it to your private wallet so that you don\u2019t have any counterparty risk. Run your own node so you can monitor the network directly. Over the last several months, Bitcoiners on Twitter have adopted the laser-eyes meme.</p>\n\n<p>As the influencer Anthony \u201cPomp\u201d Pompliano\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1397592014426943493\">put it recently</a>, it\u2019s \u201cBitcoiners vs. The World.\u201d Bitcoiners distrust banks. They\u00a0really\u00a0distrust central banks. Hardcore Bitcoiners say that you should treat everyone\u00a0<a href=\"https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/everyones-a-scammer/#:%7E:text=And%20once%20you%20have%20fallen,willpower%20is%20your%20only%20defense.\">like they\u2019re a\u00a0scammer</a>.\u00a0It\u2019s crucial to the Bitcoin project that Satoshi disappeared, because if he were still around then some people would trust his judgment.\u00a0Bitcoiners also eat a lot of meat. That\u2019s not really related to trust, it\u2019s just a distinct fact about the tribe. That\u2019s not universal by any stretch,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/ne74nw/inside-the-world-of-the-bitcoin-carnivores\">but it is a thing</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Ethereans are different. Their founder is still alive and highly influential. Vitalik Buterin doesn\u2019t have laser eyes. But he has been photographed several times wearing T-shirts with kitties on them. Rather than eating meat,\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/895490413481541633\">he eats a lot of coconut, dark chocolate, nuts\u00a0and avocados</a>. The biggest decentralized crypto exchange on Ethereum is called\u00a0<a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, and it\u2019s got a whimsical unicorn-themed motif. No macho bro stuff. After Pomp\u2019s tweet about Bitcoiners vs. the world,\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/koeppelmann/status/1397657789351215104\">some Ethereans</a>\u00a0responded\u00a0saying their mission is to be\u00a0for\u00a0the world, not vs. the world. It\u2019s a different vibe all around.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a photo of Vitalik eating avocado toast wearing a T-shirt with kitties and rainbows on it. It captures it all pretty nicely.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-07 04:29:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h0wbucb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nu4e7f","parent_id":"t1_h0wbb30","score":46,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Again, of course, these are all generalizations.

It\u2019s fun to trade coins on a decentralized exchange, but presumably at some point\u00a0the things you\u2019re trading need to produce real-world value beyond\u00a0just\u00a0more trading of coins.

A bunch of the projects went on to be total flops.

From a tech perspective,\u00a0it\u2019s exciting\u00a0to think that anyone can write some code and launch a de facto bank into the world that matches borrowers and lenders in some novel way. It\u2019s also already possible on Ethereum to represent some kind of \u201creal-world\u201d asset\u00a0on chain. For example, there are dollar-denominated stablecoins that exist as Ethereum tokens (in a format known as ERC-20). There\u2019s an Ethereum coin\u00a0[backed by physical gold](https://www.paxos.com/paxgold/).\u00a0And in\u00a0theory, a stream of cash flows from a business or household borrower could be turned into a token.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, all the lending and borrowing that happens on these platforms is overcollateralized. So you might post $110 worth of Ethereum and get $100 worth of a stablecoin back, which you can use to speculate on more coins.\u00a0This type\u00a0of lending is easy for a smart contract to handle because the collateral liquidation can be automated if the price of Ethereum goes down. This kind of model makes sense for speculative purposes, because lots of people have coins and want to borrow money against them to buy more coins.\n\nBuilding a DeFi lending model for, say,\u00a0getting a mortgage, is way more complex. The chain can\u2019t judge your creditworthiness.\u00a0The chain can\u2019t just evict you if you stop paying. The chain can\u2019t go out and do an appraisal. The chain doesn\u2019t know if the market price of your home has gone down or anything like that. For all of that, you need actual humans.\n\nPeople are working to solve all of the above, but it\u2019s complicated and legally kludgy.\u00a0Right now, they\u00a0involve a hybrid of DeFi capital with human agents. There\u2019s a startup, for example, called\u00a0[Centrifuge,](https://centrifuge.io/)\u00a0which lends money into a\u00a0Special Purpose Vehicle, which then goes on to finance small real estate investments. The income stream from that SPV then gets turned into an Ethereum ERC-20 token, which is then used as collateral in a protocol called Maker, which backs a stablecoin called Dai. Centrifuge is allowed to mint Dai (which it can then sell for actual dollars to an OTC crypto trading desk), and in theory this allows for real-world investment to be financed on-chain.\n\nThe degree to which this is actually going to work at any kind of scale is far from settled. And it\u2019s also not clear what kind of edge these projects will have over traditional finance. (Centrifuge claims that its cost of capital is cheaper this way, and that the system can be used to finance projects that are too small for bigger banks to worry about.)\n\n\n\n\n[Another startup called Maple](https://www.maple.finance/)\u00a0is doing something similar, building a platform that (theoretically) makes it very easy for anyone to create a lending portfolio, where an individual or team sources qualified borrowers, with funding drawn from decentralized pools of capital. The main pitch is basically that DeFi platforms are incredibly\u00a0simple and elegant, with fewer middlemen and paperwork and so forth.\n\nSo people are, in fact, trying to solve\u00a0the \u201cwhat for?\u201d question. There are active efforts to make this all something beyond just people borrowing money to buy more coins.\n\nWhether they actually scale up and become useful\u00a0is a separate question.\u00a0\n\nThe other huge question is\u00a0whether governments end up being cool with people launching apps that are basically banks or lending institutions or stock markets or synthetic derivatives exchanges, all without adherence to existing financial regulations.\n\n\n\n\nLike right now you can go to Uniswap to\u00a0connect your Ethereum wallet, and trade it for a token that will track the price of Apple.\u00a0[Check it out yourself](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap).\u00a0\n\n\ufffc\n\nThere\u2019s no registering for an account at Uniswap. They don\u2019t\u00a0have your name. There\u2019s no KYC/AML or anything like that. All they have are the numbers and letters that constitute the\u00a0Ethereum address you\u2019re using to connect.\n\nThe general bet for DeFi at this point seems to be: Regulators will be cool with all this. Or:\u00a0If they did want to stop it, they couldn\u2019t\u00a0because it\u2019s just open-source software\u00a0and that even if the companies were to go away, the software will live on. We\u2019ll see about all that.\n\nAnd again there\u2019s the question about how well it all scales if it goes after\u00a0under-collateralized lending, which is necessary if DeFi will actually be responsible for credit creation. If you need actual humans to underwrite loans and sue delinquent borrowers in court, that raises some significant costs. You might just end up doing fintech, but with ambiguous rules and a clunky database. (Blockchains are necessarily going to be clunkier and costlier than a standard database, since that\u2019s the price you pay for achieving decentralization, lack of transaction censorship, and a permission-less system where anyone is allowed to build for any purpose.)\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, TradFi capital is pretty cheap right now, so cutting into traditional financial activities may not be so easy in a space where part of the attraction for lenders is the fat yields. The point is though\u00a0there\u2019s a lot of techie optimism in DeFi that may at some point run into some serious headwinds (legal, scaling, etc.)\u00a0that don\u2019t have an easy software fix. But anyway, let\u2019s set\u00a0all these questions aside.\n\nThe problem with being used for something\n\nSo, the problem with being a coin that\u2019s actually used for something is that it has to be\u00a0good at its job. Bitcoin is slow, inefficient and transactions are costly, but nobody really expects anything more from it.\n\n(Also: Yes, to be clear there are projects that already exist that create ultra-fast payments and smart contracts on top of the Bitcoin network. I\u2019m acknowledging them here because otherwise someone is going to freak out and say that Bitcoin has solved these problems. They remain pretty niche. And more importantly, even if they don\u2019t take off, Bitcoin\u2019s digital gold application narrative would remain intact).\n\nEthereum, as it currently stands, has more or less the same problems as Bitcoin\u00a0when it comes to scaling. It\u2019s fairly slow\u00a0and transactions are expensive. Slow and expensive is fine if you\u2019re gold. It\u2019s not great if you\u2019re trying to power financial services. Let\u2019s go back to the arcade analogy for a second. One difference between Ethereum and Chuck E. Cheese is that the price of a game isn\u2019t fixed. It\u2019s a little bit like surge pricing. When lots of people are suddenly trading (during a spike in volatility), your fees go up, as the system can only process so many transactions at a time and traders compete with each other for scarce block space. So if you\u2019re playing digital racehorses, and suddenly there\u2019s a market crash and transaction fees surge, that\u2019s not ideal.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s something that actually happened: A few weeks back, the cost of using the Ethereum network surged because someone made a parody coin of Dogecoin, and it was briefly so popular that everything else got slowed down or\u00a0more expensive. Because there\u2019s a finite amount of Ethereum transaction capacity, anyone else using the network either had to wait their turn in the back of the line, or pay more to jump ahead of the dog token traders.\n\nThis dumbass token SHIB and all exchanges listing it really set a bad precedent. Now these new SHIB copycats are quite literally rekting Ethereum's gas fees. Look at the most recent blocks and transactions with the highest gas. It's all these meme tokens\u00a0[pic.twitter.com/F7T3bOpKHw](https://t.co/F7T3bOpKHw)\n\n\u2014 Larry Cermak (@lawmaster)[May 10,\u00a0](https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1391822738713686023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If you squint hard you can kind of glimpse a future\u00a0where DeFi becomes more than just a gambling game. From a tech perspective,\u00a0it\u2019s exciting\u00a0to think that anyone can write some code and launch a de facto bank into the world that matches borrowers and lenders in some novel way. It\u2019s also already possible on Ethereum to represent some kind of \u201creal-world\u201d asset\u00a0on chain. For example, there are dollar-denominated stablecoins that exist as Ethereum tokens (in a format known as ERC-20). There\u2019s an Ethereum coin\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.paxos.com/paxgold/\">backed by physical gold</a>.\u00a0And in\u00a0theory, a stream of cash flows from a business or household borrower could be turned into a token.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, all the lending and borrowing that happens on these platforms is overcollateralized. So you might post $110 worth of Ethereum and get $100 worth of a stablecoin back, which you can use to speculate on more coins.\u00a0This type\u00a0of lending is easy for a smart contract to handle because the collateral liquidation can be automated if the price of Ethereum goes down. This kind of model makes sense for speculative purposes, because lots of people have coins and want to borrow money against them to buy more coins.</p>\n\n<p>Building a DeFi lending model for, say,\u00a0getting a mortgage, is way more complex. The chain can\u2019t judge your creditworthiness.\u00a0The chain can\u2019t just evict you if you stop paying. The chain can\u2019t go out and do an appraisal. The chain doesn\u2019t know if the market price of your home has gone down or anything like that. For all of that, you need actual humans.</p>\n\n<p>People are working to solve all of the above, but it\u2019s complicated and legally kludgy.\u00a0Right now, they\u00a0involve a hybrid of DeFi capital with human agents. There\u2019s a startup, for example, called\u00a0<a href=\"https://centrifuge.io/\">Centrifuge,</a>\u00a0which lends money into a\u00a0Special Purpose Vehicle, which then goes on to finance small real estate investments. The income stream from that SPV then gets turned into an Ethereum ERC-20 token, which is then used as collateral in a protocol called Maker, which backs a stablecoin called Dai. Centrifuge is allowed to mint Dai (which it can then sell for actual dollars to an OTC crypto trading desk), and in theory this allows for real-world investment to be financed on-chain.</p>\n\n<p>The degree to which this is actually going to work at any kind of scale is far from settled. And it\u2019s also not clear what kind of edge these projects will have over traditional finance. (Centrifuge claims that its cost of capital is cheaper this way, and that the system can be used to finance projects that are too small for bigger banks to worry about.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.maple.finance/\">Another startup called Maple</a>\u00a0is doing something similar, building a platform that (theoretically) makes it very easy for anyone to create a lending portfolio, where an individual or team sources qualified borrowers, with funding drawn from decentralized pools of capital. The main pitch is basically that DeFi platforms are incredibly\u00a0simple and elegant, with fewer middlemen and paperwork and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>So people are, in fact, trying to solve\u00a0the \u201cwhat for?\u201d question. There are active efforts to make this all something beyond just people borrowing money to buy more coins.</p>\n\n<p>Whether they actually scale up and become useful\u00a0is a separate question.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The other huge question is\u00a0whether governments end up being cool with people launching apps that are basically banks or lending institutions or stock markets or synthetic derivatives exchanges, all without adherence to existing financial regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Like right now you can go to Uniswap to\u00a0connect your Ethereum wallet, and trade it for a token that will track the price of Apple.\u00a0<a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap\">Check it out yourself</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\ufffc</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no registering for an account at Uniswap. They don\u2019t\u00a0have your name. There\u2019s no KYC/AML or anything like that. All they have are the numbers and letters that constitute the\u00a0Ethereum address you\u2019re using to connect.</p>\n\n<p>The general bet for DeFi at this point seems to be: Regulators will be cool with all this. Or:\u00a0If they did want to stop it, they couldn\u2019t\u00a0because it\u2019s just open-source software\u00a0and that even if the companies were to go away, the software will live on. We\u2019ll see about all that.</p>\n\n<p>And again there\u2019s the question about how well it all scales if it goes after\u00a0under-collateralized lending, which is necessary if DeFi will actually be responsible for credit creation. If you need actual humans to underwrite loans and sue delinquent borrowers in court, that raises some significant costs. You might just end up doing fintech, but with ambiguous rules and a clunky database. (Blockchains are necessarily going to be clunkier and costlier than a standard database, since that\u2019s the price you pay for achieving decentralization, lack of transaction censorship, and a permission-less system where anyone is allowed to build for any purpose.)</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, TradFi capital is pretty cheap right now, so cutting into traditional financial activities may not be so easy in a space where part of the attraction for lenders is the fat yields. The point is though\u00a0there\u2019s a lot of techie optimism in DeFi that may at some point run into some serious headwinds (legal, scaling, etc.)\u00a0that don\u2019t have an easy software fix. But anyway, let\u2019s set\u00a0all these questions aside.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with being used for something</p>\n\n<p>So, the problem with being a coin that\u2019s actually used for something is that it has to be\u00a0good at its job. Bitcoin is slow, inefficient and transactions are costly, but nobody really expects anything more from it.</p>\n\n<p>(Also: Yes, to be clear there are projects that already exist that create ultra-fast payments and smart contracts on top of the Bitcoin network. I\u2019m acknowledging them here because otherwise someone is going to freak out and say that Bitcoin has solved these problems. They remain pretty niche. And more importantly, even if they don\u2019t take off, Bitcoin\u2019s digital gold application narrative would remain intact).</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum, as it currently stands, has more or less the same problems as Bitcoin\u00a0when it comes to scaling. It\u2019s fairly slow\u00a0and transactions are expensive. Slow and expensive is fine if you\u2019re gold. It\u2019s not great if you\u2019re trying to power financial services. Let\u2019s go back to the arcade analogy for a second. One difference between Ethereum and Chuck E. Cheese is that the price of a game isn\u2019t fixed. It\u2019s a little bit like surge pricing.
