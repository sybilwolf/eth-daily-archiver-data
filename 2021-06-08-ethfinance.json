It's an antiquated term, more suitable for a different category of assets that are not as subject to re-pricing as crypto.\n\n  \nIn stonks, a \"correction\" is a drop of 10% and a \"bear\" is a drop of 20%.  Obviously, we are well beyond that.  Of course, we also had drops of 20% or more twice in January, once in February, and twice in April.  \n\n  \nWithin weeks, in all cases, we saw new ATHs.  While the drawdowns were well beyond standard \"bear\" terminology, it would be hard to make a case that those were \"bears\" when they only lasted days or, at most, weeks.  \n\nThe longest correction in duration was the 37% drop from the ATH on February 19th (which was $2041, by the way, and we are STILL above that).  It took about 40 days to reach the next ATH on April 1st.  We hit our current high of $4384 on May 12th.  Obviously, 61% from peak to trough (SO FAR), it's a big dump.  Would seem pretty reasonable if it took more than 40 days to recover.  \n\nI think that the question of whether or not we are in a bear market might not be the right question.  The right questions are more likely about the duration of the price action and the magnitude of the drawdown.  We are now something like 29 days into this, and we have not recovered 50% of the peak-to-trough.  After the February dump, we recovered that 50% in 16 days.  Again, the magnitude is 1.5x the February move.  The duration also appears to be longer. \n\nBut thinking about crypto in terms of days or weeks seems shortsighted.  I'm curious...who thinks we have seen the 2021 high at $4384 and who thinks we will see a higher high this year?\n\nIn my opinion, it's hard to call it a \"bear\" when we are up more than 300% from the day I set up my validator, which was Christmas 2020.  I'm not even sure it's a \"bear\" if we've hit our high for the year, but we recover 50% of the drawdown and find ourselves in a trading range 30% down from the ATH at around $3000.  \n\nI don't believe I am over-invested with ETH as 15% of net worth and all crypto at less than 25%, but the buy orders I have on deck right now are relatively small.  I'd rather see the price go up than down, because any additional accumulation on my part will be small compared to what I have invested.  I'm sure many of you love the notion of a dump so you can buy more.  \n\nSo I hope this isn't just hopium, but I'm having a hard time NOT thinking that we're closer to the trough than the peak.  That doesn't mean we go back to $4384 this summer.  I think it would be at least a couple of months, if not longer.

[Here's an old post on farm](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn50dps/?context=3).\n\nIf you want a yield aggregator I'm actively investing in it's YFI. Look at this: https://yearn.science/ TVL has already fully recovered from the crash but the price certainly hasn't. That's a great sign of protocol strength and adoption while the asset price is half of what it was at the peak. \n\nALCX I'm effectively building a position just by farming the ETH/ALCX SLP and selling the ALCX rewards for ETH. As the ALCX price falls I end up with more of it and so far I'm net ETH positive though that doesn't account for taxes. I'll start DCAing when they hit PE 20 which mostly just requires time for the ALCX issuance to simmer down.\n\nXTK I have a large stack I farmed but I'm not buying it, it's more like there was some opportunity cost of lost rewards elsewhere but until I claim it I owe 0 taxes and I can let that ride for a few years. High upper end potential, low opportunity cost. It was a good deal when the rates were like 250% APR.\n\nMAKER I'm fully bullish on. PE 19 right now. Active DCA. This could definitely 10x in another year or two.\n\nAnother I'm evaluating right now is BNT. I can look into MFI.\n\nOtherwise I have some CEX tokens I'm holding from when they were good deals but plan to sell when long term capital gains tax kicks in such as KCS and NEXO. I wouldn't buy them now but NEXO was a good pickup at $.12-$.15 and KCS was fine at $1.50.\n\nI have a slew of other things such as UNI too, there's just a lot of wiggle room between PE 20 where I'm adding to positions and PE 100 where I'm reducing positions. So there are things I hold and don't have much to talk about because it's in no man's land.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;d say more that FARM has some proving of itself to do before I&#39;m bullish.

That&#39;s a great sign of protocol strength and adoption while the asset price is half of what it was at the peak. </p>\n\n<p>ALCX I&#39;m effectively building a position just by farming the ETH/ALCX SLP and selling the ALCX rewards for ETH. As the ALCX price falls I end up with more of it and so far I&#39;m net ETH positive though that doesn&#39;t account for taxes. I&#39;ll start DCAing when they hit PE 20 which mostly just requires time for the ALCX issuance to simmer down.</p>\n\n<p>XTK I have a large stack I farmed but I&#39;m not buying it, it&#39;s more like there was some opportunity cost of lost rewards elsewhere but until I claim it I owe 0 taxes and I can let that ride for a few years. High upper end potential, low opportunity cost. It was a good deal when the rates were like 250% APR.</p>\n\n<p>MAKER I&#39;m fully bullish on. PE 19 right now. Active DCA. This could definitely 10x in another year or two.</p>\n\n<p>Another I&#39;m evaluating right now is BNT. I can look into MFI.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise I have some CEX tokens I&#39;m holding from when they were good deals but plan to sell when long term capital gains tax kicks in such as KCS and NEXO. I wouldn&#39;t buy them now but NEXO was a good pickup at $.12-$.15 and KCS was fine at $1.50.</p>\n\n<p>I have a slew of other things such as UNI too, there&#39;s just a lot of wiggle room between PE 20 where I&#39;m adding to positions and PE 100 where I&#39;m reducing positions. So there are things I hold and don&#39;t have much to talk about because it&#39;s in no man&#39;s land.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-08 21:04:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1446sz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nuwt2s","parent_id":"t1_h13fq2p","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/wanderingcryptowolf","body":"Logris, I greatly appreciate your forthcoming nature with your knowledge, in the past few months you've inspired me to walk down many different tracks of reading / research / podcasts pertaining to the DeFi space! \n\nIt's all quite exciting, and I've barely dipped my toe in. \n\nFor that I sincerely thank you. \n\nAs always, I've saved your comment to add to the compilation of valuable info that serves me as points of departure for further reading. \n\nIf you ever do happen to gaze in to MFI I am eager to hear your perspective. \n\nAs I understand it they will work as a leveraging protocol for one part, in tandem with ALCX. \n\nScoopy explained it thusly: \n\n- lock collateral in the alcx protocol \n- take out your loan \n- if you desire degen leverage plays on MFI capped at 5x \n\nThey brushed over it very briefly.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Logris, I greatly appreciate your forthcoming nature with your knowledge, in the past few months you&#39;ve inspired me to walk down many different tracks of reading / research / podcasts pertaining to the DeFi space! </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s all quite exciting, and I&#39;ve barely dipped my toe in. </p>\n\n<p>For that I sincerely thank you. </p>\n\n<p>As always, I&#39;ve saved your comment to add to the compilation of valuable info that serves me as points of departure for further reading. </p>\n\n<p>If you ever do happen to gaze in to MFI I am eager to hear your perspective. </p>\n\n<p>As I understand it they will work as a leveraging protocol for one part, in tandem with ALCX. </p>\n\n<p>Scoopy explained it thusly: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>lock collateral in the alcx protocol </li>\n<li>take out your loan </li>\n<li>if you desire degen leverage plays on MFI capped at 5x </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They brushed over it very briefly.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-08 21:21:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h145wj6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nuwt2s","parent_id":"t1_h1446sz","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/CanWeTalkEth","body":"Am I dumb?
