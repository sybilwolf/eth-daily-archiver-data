I had someone make an ethereum painting for me to hang in the office and its coming this weekend!  I highly recommended the artist make a digital version as an NFT.  I also told her I would make sure to share on reddit with the Eth fam and everywhere else!  Any suggestions on where to share and what advice to give on the NFT piece (I have not interacted in the NFT space yet) and want to support this young ladies dream!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-09 21:23:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h18rwpj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t3_nvnp5f","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/illBoopYaHead","body":"feel like pure shit, just want the halfway flippening back x","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>feel like pure shit, just want the halfway flippening back x</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-09 05:03:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h155ral","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t3_nvnp5f","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Mister_Eth","body":"Ethereum","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-08 22:00:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h149las","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t3_nvnp5f","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Vinegar_Strokes__","body":"$2458","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$2458</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-08 22:01:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h149p6z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t1_h149las","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stripedbluewallpaper","body":".074","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>.074</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-08 22:12:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h14an2k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t1_h149p6z","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/zutrasimlo","body":"Daddy eth \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf46","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Daddy eth \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf46</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-08 22:44:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h14dev9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t1_h149las","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"BTC go down, ETH go down more\n\nBTC go back up, ETH go back up less\n\nClassic.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>BTC go down, ETH go down more</p>\n\n<p>BTC go back up, ETH go back up less</p>\n\n<p>Classic.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-09 05:49:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h15alhc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t3_nvnp5f","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/epic_trader","body":"ETH goes up\n\nPeople still find a reason to moan\n\nClassic.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>ETH goes up</p>\n\n<p>People still find a reason to moan</p>\n\n<p>Classic.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-09 06:03:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h15c9fd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t1_h15alhc","score":42,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/decibels42","body":"This is the wei.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is the wei.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-09 07:16:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h15lpqt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t1_h15c9fd","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/hblask","body":"If you pick two random days during the time they have both existed, there is a 90% chance this is not true.

Why?  Well we often see that during these massive dumps (50%) in our example that stables actually trade ABOVE the peg because there&#39;s soo many more participants looking to close out their CDPs than those willing to generate more dai with collateral that is quickly losing value.  This is similar to the economic decision of selling now even though we&#39;re very red because it&#39;s looking like it&#39;s going down more. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, you&#39;re esentially a forced buyer of dai during these times which pushes up price.  Plus, you&#39;d rather pay a premium for dai than get liquidated on Maker because of the liquidation penalty.</p>\n\n<p>CONCLUSION:  during crunches you&#39;re likely to see short term demand for dai outstrip short term supply and push price above peg.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>T-2 Conditions:</p>\n\n<p>Eth Price is 250</p>\n\n<p>Dai Price ???</p>\n\n<p>Eth-A vault is now at 83% / 120% LTV</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Notes:  The eth-a vault is now insolvent.  The liquidation mechanism seems to have failed completely.  You&#39;re now considered &quot;bad debt&quot; for the system.  What&#39;s going to happen?  Well, if you have that dai you borrowed sitting around somewhere, then good for you.  Don&#39;t repay your debt.  Literally go and buy eth with it as quickly as possible because Dai is likely going to quickly fall below its peg because it&#39;s no longer redeemable for a dollar&#39;s worth of collateral.  At this point, the maker system is supposed to issue MKR to sell at market to cover your bad debt as a last ditch effort to bail out the system.</p>\n\n<p>CONCLUSION:  We see as the value of collateral drops the price for dai quickly increases to a certain point until the system reaches critical &quot;oh fuck&quot; levels of insolvency and then dai plummets as the protocol fails and becomes insolvent.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-09 14:15:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h17bvyg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nvnp5f","parent_id":"t1_h17a3rw","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Middle-Athlete","body":"So alchemix is a much more complicated answer.
