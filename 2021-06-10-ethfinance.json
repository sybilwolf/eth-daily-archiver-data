In most fields, writing software with that kind of rigor isn&#39;t worth it to the companies funding development, so oftentimes the developers writing smart contracts are largely unfamiliar with the tools and techniques of writing high-reliability software. If you write code for pacemakers and rockets, okay, you&#39;ve probably got the right mentality and habits already.
