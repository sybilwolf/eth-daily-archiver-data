Consider this for a second... stocks have been the best investment mankind has seen, and have averaged around 10% annual return. Ethereum, off staking returns alone, will beat that, and potentially 2.5x that (not sure for how long). Of course, there is some risk involved, mainly the price exposure to ETH, but that can be offset with a short as [Professor Chaos so eloquently explained in his report](https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1387074095007817730?s=20). \n\nThis is all of the top of my head, so forgive me if I've forgotten a few things.

We have former CFTC Chairman <a href=\"https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/digital-dollar-project-to-launch-pilot-programs-to-explore-designs-and-uses-of-a-us-central-bank-digital-currency.htm\">J. Christopher Giancarlo working with Accenture to develop CBDCs</a> and the digital dollar. We have real users <a href=\"https://cryptofees.info/\">paying to use the Ethereum blockchain</a>, along with several projects build on top of Ethereum generating more fees than the top dog. We&#39;ll have a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1387393917570723841?s=20\">double digit risk-free staking APR</a> when PoS goes live (risk-free in the crypto world, at least). </p>\n\n<p>That last point is rather crazy. Consider this for a second... stocks have been the best investment mankind has seen, and have averaged around 10% annual return. Ethereum, off staking returns alone, will beat that, and potentially 2.5x that (not sure for how long). Of course, there is some risk involved, mainly the price exposure to ETH, but that can be offset with a short as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1387074095007817730?s=20\">Professor Chaos so eloquently explained in his report</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This is all of the top of my head, so forgive me if I&#39;ve forgotten a few things. I am bullish on Ethereum, and certainly not selling. If the market decides to take a drip sub $2k I&#39;ll be DCA&#39;ing in what I can. But again, you do what is right for you.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-11 11:27:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1fk09l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nx7t3y","parent_id":"t3_nx7t3y","score":77,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/interweaver","body":"This!\n\nThe fundamentals are strong.

Note that block rewards/issuance is drastically lower on beacon chain than what miners get currently, and we will only have the issuance of the beacon chain post-merge.  Additionally, there will be a brief period, maybe a couple months, where we have merged but there is no mechanism to withdraw, meaning new, available supply drops to 0 till that gets activated. On top of all that, we will have EIP1559 burning existing Eth, offsetting issuance even more.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-11 13:21:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1fzm4k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nx7t3y","parent_id":"t1_h1fqro7","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/youvebeenliedto","body":"Whether you stake 32, 64, 96 etc the approx APR is 7% (right now) and will probably stick between 5-7% in the future.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Whether you stake 32, 64, 96 etc the approx APR is 7% (right now) and will probably stick between 5-7% in the future.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-11 12:01:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1foqga","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nx7t3y","parent_id":"t1_h1fobyc","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/cryptrd285","body":"https://twitter.com/CL207/status/1403378521947344900?s=19","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CL207/status/1403378521947344900?s=19\">https://twitter.com/CL207/status/1403378521947344900?s=19</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-11 12:41:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1fu0ho","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nx7t3y","parent_id":"t3_nx7t3y","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LavoP","body":"RIP in ETH/DEFI5 pool.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>RIP in ETH/DEFI5 pool.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-11 12:49:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1fv6ng","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nx7t3y","parent_id":"t1_h1fu0ho","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/geoffbezos","body":"Anyone know if there\u2019s a token issued out for the Flashbots MEV related project?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Anyone know if there\u2019s a token issued out for the Flashbots MEV related project?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-11 13:09:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1fxyxn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nx7t3y","parent_id":"t3_nx7t3y","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stablecoin","body":"alchemist MIST...read about their Mist-X exchange, gasless exchange using an MEV trading pool off chain.
