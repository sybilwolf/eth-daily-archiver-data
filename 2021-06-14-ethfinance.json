But no I haven't backtracked, as crashing the price on just 1 or 2 of the top 5 exchanges would probably have some very large ripple/cascading effect across the market.  I meant 0 as a figure of speech since presumably a 95%+ crash would be enough to kill the market (but I guess that wasn't a good example since ETH went through a 94% crash from ATH in 2018 and recovered fine).\n\nWould be nice for those shitcoins to go to 0. Tron is at 7 cents, and if Justin Sun market sold his bag (around 35% of supply) it would probably be at 0.00000000x lol. \n\nMy point was just that Saylor alone has enough to dump the price 70-90% at any given time on some of the major exchanges. But yes you're right that going to actual zero wouldn't happen (unless that was the catalyst for everyone to give up on BTC).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This post was meant as a joke lol.
