If you can get some shmucks at a bank to give you 95% of your property value in cash at 4% and then turn around and make 10-20% on that in stablecoin farming that sounds like an epic play to me. The major thing to note is you&#39;re 20x long on the real estate market at that point. If housing prices slump 5%, you&#39;re underwater on the property. Interest rates probably aren&#39;t going <em>down</em> from here so have a good reason that housing prices in your area are likely to go up despite that.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-15 10:17:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1vb15r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o0674j","parent_id":"t1_h1v9c0t","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/blackdowney","body":"Just talked to a lender who basically can\u2019t just take my crypto like MakerDAO and give me cash for the down payment.

These countries will leapfrog most of the G20 countries in terms of usage and innovation around crypto because we continue to think (generally speaking) with the mentality that poverty = ignorance/lack of intelligence/lack of innovation. It simply doesn&#39;t. Their social capital (read: &quot;networks&quot;) is vastly superior to our own - hardened and strengthened like steel because of the poverty and adversity they have faced, and the recurring cycle thereof. I have had the privilege of meeting members of these communities all over the world. It will be almost shocking to see how quickly the innovators and early adopters will influence the early and late majorities in these communities. And, because of remittances, it will filter back up the chain to migrant communities across the globe. </p>\n\n<p>Within six - twelve months, I would not be surprised to see between 3-5 additional countries follow behind El Salvador - one from Africa, one or two from Latin America, one from Southeast Asia, and possibly one from the Caribbean - the UAE or another West-Asian country could surprise me on this, so I cannot rule it out completely, but I think these other locations are more likely.</p>\n\n<p>The technology is coming around. It just takes patience &amp; education and the practical application will follow. And, it doesn&#39;t hurt to have an example or two as exhibits A and/or B. El Salvador is certainly a start.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-15 14:12:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1w7s26","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o0674j","parent_id":"t1_h1vu6cd","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"You should make a bet on some of these claims with krok.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You should make a bet on some of these claims with krok.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-15 14:35:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1waukw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o0674j","parent_id":"t1_h1w7s26","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"Nothing will change here.
