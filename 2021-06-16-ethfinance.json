Sure a full staking node cost 32 ETH but you can stake with much less anywhere else, with caveats.\n\nEthereum brings the tools of production back to peoples hands.

A vague measure of what your time is worth according to our capitalist overlords. That&#39;s what they would like you to think so.</p>\n\n<p>But here&#39;s the thing. (Big) money generates money. So having (big) money means generating time or at least, ways to shorten those pesky wait times for X or Y, to spare it.</p>\n\n<p>The old world is reliant on keeping our time busy generating money (you&#39;ve got to eat!) but also funneling it towards the top of the pyramid.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum too  can generate money by staking of DeFi, on its own, automatically (just like being a privileged capitalist in the old world - only you&#39;re not burning out your employee which have not choice but to work to have a living but a CPU - or someone else CPU)</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of it is that the tools to generate that are available to anyone, contrarian to the capitalist idea. Sure a full staking node cost 32 ETH but you can stake with much less anywhere else, with caveats.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum brings the tools of production back to peoples hands.

A defi staple. What they offer is something totally new in the financial space and wasn&#39;t possible before ethereum.
