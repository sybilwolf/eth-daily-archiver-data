We use gitcoin grants to encourage healthy staking and to support developers who improve accessibility to staking. I&#39;d say the three biggest accomplishments of EthStaker in the past year have been ramping up the community for staking, creating an environment where Stakehouse can thrive and develop tools for stakers, and inching toward client diversity with efforts like pushing multi-client support in Rocket Pool, working with Dappnode to support more clients, and working with leobago to deliver the best client usage data we can. I don&#39;t care to ask for money, but I do feel strongly that contributions sent to EthStaker and its affiliates will benefit the community in a myriad of ways.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-17 08:13:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h23j2cq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o1ozff","parent_id":"t1_h2326b2","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"I did try to look out for you guys out there in the TITAN lands :(\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nzf3do/daily\\_general\\_discussion\\_june\\_14\\_2021/h1q1cn6?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nzf3do/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2021/h1q1cn6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nzf3do/daily\\_general\\_discussion\\_june\\_14\\_2021/h1q96ql?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nzf3do/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2021/h1q96ql?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*Funds won't be safu for long.*\n\n\\-- Savage-dragon, 3 days before the titan apocalypse.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I did try to look out for you guys out there in the TITAN lands :(</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nzf3do/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2021/h1q1cn6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nzf3do/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2021/h1q1cn6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nzf3do/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2021/h1q96ql?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nzf3do/daily_general_discussion_june_14_2021/h1q96ql?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Funds won&#39;t be safu for long.</em></p>\n\n<p>-- Savage-dragon, 3 days before the titan apocalypse.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-17 04:53:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h22v6e1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o1ozff","parent_id":"t3_o1ozff","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Papazio","body":"Good work Dragon.
