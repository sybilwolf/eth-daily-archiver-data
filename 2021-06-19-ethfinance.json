When I write about PE (price/earnings), all the work goes into calculating revenue. I'd like to discuss some of the choice points I have made deciding what counts as revenue in my PE calculations using examples from the ecosystem.\n\n* Does all protocol revenue count or only revenue that benefits token holders?\n\nWhen evaluating a token I'm evaluating the benefits I personally accrue for owning that token, not the benefits *other* participants in the ecosystem accrue from the platform. For example, when I look at tokenterminal for Aave right now they show a P/S ratio of 11.96. When I last did a [calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/myq125/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2021/gvyspq1/\n) I came up with something closer to 2000. So, did I miss 99% of the revenue in some glaring oversight? Not exactly. Tokenterminal is calculating all the lender revenue in their P/S value. But that doesn't benefit *me* as a token holder. I can decide to *use* a platform such as Aave or Alchemix without deciding to be a token holder. Thus my opinion about a platform as a user can be very different than my opinion about the financial opportunity of its token.\n\n* Different classes of stakeholders?\n\nLet's take something like [KNC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/l961ub/daily_general_discussion_january_31_2021/glhq0ym/?context=3). There are different classes of stakeholders. Stakers earn staking revenue (in ETH) that other KNC holders such as AMM LP's don't earn. When calculating PE, I'm calculating PE specifically for the class of user I would fall into. Taking KNC staking as an example, all holders benefit from the 6.2% burn but only stakers get the 62.7% of the protocol fees. If you plan to be a staker you need to calculate the staker revenue, which requires calculating what percent of the KNC is staked, projecting trading fees, etc.\n\nAs a different example, RPL has inflation, but not everyone receives that inflation equally. They basically have an elite council that receives extra inflation. If you aren't part of this elite group that issuance is a debasement cost to you personally. I'm not saying this is bad incentive design, not all participants in an equal system provide equal benefit and in a well designed system participants are rewarded according to the benefits they provide. I'm only saying that you need to be aware of the different classes of stakeholders and be aware of how you are going to be treated by that ecosystem as part of that class.\n\n* If a governance token manages a treasury, does treasury revenue count, or only the dividends?\n\nI'd like to think a token should be worth at minimum the value of the treasury it manages. This point came up when the DGX DAO decided to dissolve itself when its token was worth like 1/3 of its treasury. It's also a more nuanced point than you might think. What does a treasury consist of? Is it just funds that could be taken by whomever holds the admin key? Even if AAVE stakeholders *could* vote to dissolve AAVE and take all the deposited funds (I'm not sure they physically can) I wouldn't call those funds a treasury. Even in a more benign case, if treasury funds are earmarked for something other than me the token holder, should I count that in revenue? Back to point 1, maybe not. So, if Maker has fees earmarked to a surplus buffer, should we count that as revenue in PE? How about if Alchemix has revenue earmarked for a transmuter to defend the alUSD peg? In the former case, they have it structured as a temporary measure. In the latter case they don't but I can certainly imagine a future where the transmuter black hole creates a reserve so large that ALCX voters vote for a cut of it. When I calculate the MKR PE I am including the revenue that goes to the surplus buffer because of a notion I call *time horizon*. In the latter case in my [ALCX post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ne77c3/daily_general_discussion_may_17_2021/gygrxyt/) I do show the PE if the transmuter revenue was considered for PE but I think it's more fair of a calculation if it isn't included. In other cases like [YFI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/n3ob9p/daily_general_discussion_may_3_2021/gwuskk2/) where all treasury overflow eventually gets used for YFI buybacks, I include most revenue as a slush pool. It's a nuanced point.\n\n* What time horizon do we estimate revenue on?\n\nWhen calculating something like trading volume for Uniswap the volume looks exponential. So, do you do an exponential projection of volume or a linear projection of volume? Even in the former case, how far back do you go when calculating average volume? The further back you go the lower the average volume will look, but too short a horizon is equally dishonest.\n\nThis concept of time horizon comes up in other ways. If there are short term costs such as something like BREAD that is paying off a hack harvest once had do you include that as a cost in the PE? How about something like the surplus buffer in MKR which should fill and then be done? How about issuance which is known but decaying over time? Something like [FARM](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/li50pk/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2021/gn50dps/?context=3) issues 4% less of itself every week. Do you project the debasement cost out 30 days, 90 days, a year, or an average of the next several years? If deciding to hold you might model it based on the time horizon of your hold. If deciding to buy, I'd personally wait until shorter time horizons indicate the system is in profit *right now*. In the case of farm above I did a calculation projecting out over 30 days and then a year to make the case that I could get excited about the coin but not until debasement pressure had died down a good bit first. It was something to *watch*. And it's a good thing I watched instead of bought because it's down from $410 the day of that post to $55 today.\n\nThere are a lot of these little points that come up across the ecosystem and *any* calculation you find of PE is going to have some opinionated answers. The best I can do for you all is being transparent about my calculation, which is something I don't see from tokenterminal or theblock.\n\nEdit: With that out of the way I'm going to get outside for a bit and enjoy the beautiful weather here. I'll reply to comments later tonight.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is going to be a rant about revenue. When I write about PE (price/earnings), all the work goes into calculating revenue.

And it&#39;s a good thing I watched instead of bought because it&#39;s down from $410 the day of that post to $55 today.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of these little points that come up across the ecosystem and <em>any</em> calculation you find of PE is going to have some opinionated answers. The best I can do for you all is being transparent about my calculation, which is something I don&#39;t see from tokenterminal or theblock.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: With that out of the way I&#39;m going to get outside for a bit and enjoy the beautiful weather here.

But theoretically if miners could 51% attack the chain over a long period of time, then release those blocks all of a sudden, there would be no in-protocol penalty to them for doing so. And since their mining rigs would still be as functional as ever, could repeat the attack as long as they still had 51%.\n> \n> Ouroboros also uses probabilistic finality, though it works a bit differently since Ouroboros is PoS. As long as 51% of staking pools are honest, the chain is good to go. But if pools collude, they could theoretically 51% attack the chain and revert transactions. The likely result is that people would see the news on Reddit/Facebook/MSNBC (hopefully), have their wallet keys handy, and be able to undelegate their stake from the rogue block producers. But that kind of fault correction relies on a sort of process where a bunch of normal ADA holders have to see the news, come together out of the woodwork, pull out their wallets, and re-delegate. It could take hours or even a day or two for enough people to realize and delegate their stake away from the attackers, meanwhile transactions cannot really be confirmed on the network in a meaningful way.\n> \n> With Ethereum's Beacon Chain PoS, if 51% of stakers try to attack the chain and revert transactions, all of their stake gets immediately and automatically destroyed by the protocol. There is a very direct, automatic protocol process that happens to right the consensus, and thus a big concrete deterrent for anyone trying to do it.\n> \n> Direct finality reversion protection through slashing is a feature I always wished Ouroboros had, as in summary, I believe it relies on some weaker social assumptions when it could just have protection baked directly into the protocol like Beacon Chain PoS does.\n\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/o3lwj7/smart_contracts_coming_to_cardano/h2dakud/?context=1","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What is <strong>finality</strong>, and what is <strong>finality reversion</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Someone asked me that question on another subreddit.</p>\n\n<p>I explained it the best I could, quoted below.

There is a very direct, automatic protocol process that happens to right the consensus, and thus a big concrete deterrent for anyone trying to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Direct finality reversion protection through slashing is a feature I always wished Ouroboros had, as in summary, I believe it relies on some weaker social assumptions when it could just have protection baked directly into the protocol like Beacon Chain PoS does.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/o3lwj7/smart_contracts_coming_to_cardano/h2dakud/?context=1\">https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/o3lwj7/smart_contracts_coming_to_cardano/h2dakud/?context=1</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-19 15:44:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2dc6iz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o38mp4","parent_id":"t3_o38mp4","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/laninsterJr","body":"sauce has some snake oil taste\ud83d\ude02","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>sauce has some snake oil taste\ud83d\ude02</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-19 15:50:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2dcsw1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o38mp4","parent_id":"t1_h2dc6iz","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Thought it was chicken.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thought it was chicken.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-19 17:33:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2dncxt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o38mp4","parent_id":"t1_h2dcsw1","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Mister_Eth","body":"Ethereum","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-18 22:00:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2alhiu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o38mp4","parent_id":"t3_o38mp4","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/zutrasimlo","body":"He has spoken","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>He has spoken</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-18 23:02:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2aqeq7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o38mp4","parent_id":"t1_h2alhiu","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Vinegar_Strokes__","body":"$2196","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$2196</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-18 22:00:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2alihj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o38mp4","parent_id":"t1_h2alhiu","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stripedbluewallpaper","body":"0.063","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>0.063</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-18 22:27:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2anot0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o38mp4","parent_id":"t1_h2alihj","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Stalslagga","body":"$2208","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$2208</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-18 22:12:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2amhrb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o38mp4","parent_id":"t1_h2alihj","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/TheOnlyHodlerInCuau","body":"Ethereumn't","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereumn&#39;t</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-18 22:06:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2am0u3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o38mp4","parent_id":"t1_h2alihj","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I see many talk about the possibility of ETH's dip to low 3digit numbers, following the 2017 pattern.
