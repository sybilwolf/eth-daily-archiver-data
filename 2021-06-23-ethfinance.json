Instead go and educate yourself. For example by listening to the Bankless podcast. Their recent interview with Jim Bianco  once again delivers a truckload full of insights, knowledge and inspiration. Here is my favourite part of it:\n\n*Let me talk about the banks and let me not get p\\*\\*\\*\\* off while I do so.*\n\n*In 1871 Western Union invented the wire transfer and if you wanted to send $300 to somebody say in San Francisco it would cost you 3%. Back in 1871 they had to but the 300$ in a pouch, get on a horse and ride it to San Francisco. It cost you 3% to send money in 1871 and it took to two to four days.*\n\n*In 2021 to do a wire transfer (not a bank transfer) it costs 3% and takes two days. Not one damn thing has changed in 150 years when it comes to the banking system. Nothing is changed when you look at remittances. There are over one billion migrant workers right down around the world. They are working in some of the worst conditions ever to make some money to send back to their families.*\n\n*The average commission on a remittence is about 10 to 15%. They work one month a year to basically pay the bank and its 500 billion dollars a year that they are paying to the banks to send money to their families.

Instead go and educate yourself. For example by listening to the Bankless podcast. Their recent interview with Jim Bianco  once again delivers a truckload full of insights, knowledge and inspiration. Here is my favourite part of it:</p>\n\n<p><em>Let me talk about the banks and let me not get p\\</em>*** off while I do so.*</p>\n\n<p><em>In 1871 Western Union invented the wire transfer and if you wanted to send $300 to somebody say in San Francisco it would cost you 3%. Back in 1871 they had to but the 300$ in a pouch, get on a horse and ride it to San Francisco. It cost you 3% to send money in 1871 and it took to two to four days.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In 2021 to do a wire transfer (not a bank transfer) it costs 3% and takes two days. Not one damn thing has changed in 150 years when it comes to the banking system. Nothing is changed when you look at remittances. There are over one billion migrant workers right down around the world. They are working in some of the worst conditions ever to make some money to send back to their families.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The average commission on a remittence is about 10 to 15%.
