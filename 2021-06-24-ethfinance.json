The early depositors that were already in the Pod before the announcement will get a special &#39;genesis&#39; POAP :)</p>\n\n<p>While im here, ill also give an update in general about the Dai Pod:</p>\n\n<p>Sharingnotes has been making small tweaks and upgrades to the <a href=\"https://ethfinance.win\">ethfinance.win</a> site. It will now show the $POOL you are eligible to claim from the wallet IF it has already been claimed by the Pod. You may have more $POOL to claim, but someone will have to run CLAIM on the <a href=\"https://ethfinance.win/upkeep\">ethfinance.win/upkeep</a> page to make the Pod claim it into itself first.</p>\n\n<p>Im also starting to work on an Ethfinance Pod specific <a href=\"https://duneanalytics.com/mkkoll/PoolTogetherDAO\">metrics dashboard</a> by bastardising sarfangs awesome <a href=\"https://duneanalytics.com/sarfang/pooltogetherv3\">PoolTogether Dune Analytics dashboards</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Btw, Pod chances are 200 to 1 right now. Or about once in 3.84 years. Still not super likely we will see a win, but should happen in our lifetimes? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-24 04:28:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2vgvje","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o6tzw3","parent_id":"t3_o6tzw3","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/-lightfoot","body":"hanks for this.\n\nreat work.\n\neriously though, the pod is a brilliant thing for this community.\n\nell done.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>hanks for this.</p>\n\n<p>reat work.</p>\n\n<p>eriously though, the pod is a brilliant thing for this community.</p>\n\n<p>ell done.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-24 05:12:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2vkn7c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o6tzw3","parent_id":"t1_h2vgvje","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Mkkoll","body":"Cheers.

Many great world changing things and companies came out of it. Bubbles are great for <em>shorter</em> term investing while the bubble inflates. But after it pops...LOL. Most people were left holding the bag after it popped. Most companies that had crazy valuations no longer exist. Even the ones that survived took many years to get back to there previous levels. Sure if you were lucky enough to have bought the few that survived and thrived and held them for 30 years you&#39;ve done well, but most didn&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why I don&#39;t understand the HODL obsession with life changing amounts of money with the crypto bubbles. HODLing life changing amounts of money through 90% draw down and HOPE it bounces back in the during the next run, which may or may not ever happen is crazy to me.  I absolutely understand having <em>some</em> exposure (even a lot if your young) to crypto and HODLing through all of the ups and downs.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-24 07:00:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2vw7p6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o6tzw3","parent_id":"t1_h2vsy94","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stablecoin","body":"But you aren\u2019t buying companies.

You can just hop between different dapps and do everything immediatly.\n\nThis is more convenient.\n\nStaking is another matter however I think that people with 32+ Eth will always opt for solo staking if there is a simple out of the box solution for staking. A ledger/trezor made validator node that just requires a 30min setup. Because who is willing to pay 1000s of dollars each year to kraken/coinbase for a bit more convenience.\n\nI actually prefer if most people on the network are just users.
