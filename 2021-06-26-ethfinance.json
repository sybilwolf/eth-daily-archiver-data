This post isn't to pull out an EZPZ-esque prediction here or anything but I feel the general sentiment is way too confident that this won't be touched and I'd argue people should really be ready for this. Even just getting some cash on the sidelines ready or taking steps to mentally prepare. At an absolute minimum, it's worth the conversation for the sake of keeping varying viewpoints alive I suppose.\n\nFor starters, BTC is dominating price action. So in this case I like to stick to just 'simple math', which has us getting dangerously close on another potential BTC dump. I'm not even talking 50% reckoning part 2, but a modest negative 10% day after some bleed-out. BTC's lowest (and really brief) price of late was 29,000. Let's say we bleed down and test that over the next couple of days / week. Then the damn breaks and we have another 10% drop day for BTC to hit $26,100. Maybe ETH manages to hold strong and stays at .055. Result - $1,435. Meaning we are basically one more leg down from our prior ATH. \n\nNow ETH sits another 25% away from 3 digit ETH which sounds 'safe' on paper, but if BTC really starts tanking we just have to take into account crypto's market structure. As well as the market sentiment if breaking below prior ATH is on the table - that is pain. In an event like this, the ratio would probably go with it. (It's not looking particularly great anyway). What would that look like... .05? $1,300 / .045? $1,175 / God forbid .04? $1,044. Extrapolation and assumptions galore, but you can see how the damn breaking on the ratio would be catastrophic. All that, and then think if BTC hit $25k, $24k... so on.\n\nA common trend I'm also seeing is comparisons to prior bull cycles. The concept that no other bull cycle had a drop big enough that when applied to this ATH would hit triple digits. Well, reality is two things. 1) A bull cycle continuation isn't guaranteed in general and 2) this time might simply be different^(tm). \n\nTo the first point, I see a decent amount of \"for the bull to sustain we can't triple digit ETH\" or \"we never had a big enough drop in the past and continued the bull\"... well, maybe that in a way is the point. Maybe the bull is simply over and we are going to bleed. Now, 'bear market' is a dirty word because everyone jumps to that 3 year lull of terrible prices. However, it doesn't have to be that every time. It could only be 6 months, less then a year. Or maybe it's 3 months of a floor set and a long move sideways. Maybe it's some purgatory between the two where we range. It doesn't have to mean \"no ATH until next halvening\".\n\nTo the second point, the 4 year cycle isn't an ingrained structure of the market. It has worked so far, but it is not like a forced thing. And it ties to point one in the sense of my note of bear market lengths. And reality is The Merge combined with 1559 might break that cycle all together. But at a broad level it's important to realize that the 4 year bull market cycle is 2 data points for BTC and 1 data point for ETH. A lot of people act like this has been a 100 year trend or something. BTC doesn't have to have a blow-off top with a large DCB to signal a bull end. Rhyme, not repeat. \n\nAgain, I'll emphasize this post is mostly an exercise in making sure optimism doesn't cloud your judgement. Obviously, this could be the bottom and I'm 'wrong' (even though I'm not particularly making a prediction). And obviously I'm not calling for the end of crypto forever...

Mainly this is for the people that don't read this thread everyday and see this post, feel like it is a relevant piece of information to be aware of. Not placing any judgement on your move one way or the other (market could go up or could go down short-term who knows), no one ever lost money taking profits and I actually appreciate that you put that out there and are being accountable. \n\nI also wouldn't say triple digit eth is out of the equation for many people, I actually feel like $1,400 and triple digit eth is beginning to become the general sentiment and as of late is a fairly commonplace prediction. As with any investment you have to weigh the risk (another possible leg down for btc, increasingly negative macro outlook, bleed out on the ratio, possibility of $1,400 and triple digit eth) and the reward (how far have we come since 2017, best possible dev team in crypto you could ask for, eth 2.0 on the horizon (the moment many OGs have waited for and I personally promised myself I wouldn't sell until it has reached fruition) and finally the possibility that we are investing in something that could be the most innovative technology of our generation). Again that's just how I see it and maybe I am a \"moonboy\", but just want to remind people why we're here. Yes, there are a million opportunities to second guess yourself, \"Oh I could have doubled my stack selling at the top\", but let's be honest people forget about the other 99 times where if they traded they would have lost. \n\nThis post was mainly just a reminder that while yes, the market in the short-term may be bearish, but more often than not we end up in a worse position trying to \"time\" the market than if we just held (not even accounting for the capital gains taxes and implications on your compounding returns by now putting your \"owed\" tax money on the sidelines and out of the market). I'd be lying if I said I haven't tried to time the market, and 99% of the time I've done this I have regretted it. \n\nMy advice is if your investing in eth, have a long-term horizon (5-10 years), accumulate where you can, inform yourself as much as you can on the space and let eth do the heavy lifting. As warren buffet said best (not a great place to quote him) \"You can't produce a baby in one month, by getting 9 women pregnant.\" Give it some time and in the meanwhile enjoy the summer..","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Let me start by saying I do understand your viewpoint and think you have been a great contributor to this sub over the last few years.</p>\n\n<p>After reading this I felt the need to caveat your post with the disclaimer that you posted you sold 50% of your stack 4 days ago. Mainly this is for the people that don&#39;t read this thread everyday and see this post, feel like it is a relevant piece of information to be aware of. Not placing any judgement on your move one way or the other (market could go up or could go down short-term who knows), no one ever lost money taking profits and I actually appreciate that you put that out there and are being accountable. </p>\n\n<p>I also wouldn&#39;t say triple digit eth is out of the equation for many people, I actually feel like $1,400 and triple digit eth is beginning to become the general sentiment and as of late is a fairly commonplace prediction. As with any investment you have to weigh the risk (another possible leg down for btc, increasingly negative macro outlook, bleed out on the ratio, possibility of $1,400 and triple digit eth) and the reward (how far have we come since 2017, best possible dev team in crypto you could ask for, eth 2.0 on the horizon (the moment many OGs have waited for and I personally promised myself I wouldn&#39;t sell until it has reached fruition) and finally the possibility that we are investing in something that could be the most innovative technology of our generation). Again that&#39;s just how I see it and maybe I am a &quot;moonboy&quot;, but just want to remind people why we&#39;re here. Yes, there are a million opportunities to second guess yourself, &quot;Oh I could have doubled my stack selling at the top&quot;, but let&#39;s be honest people forget about the other 99 times where if they traded they would have lost. </p>\n\n<p>This post was mainly just a reminder that while yes, the market in the short-term may be bearish, but more often than not we end up in a worse position trying to &quot;time&quot; the market than if we just held (not even accounting for the capital gains taxes and implications on your compounding returns by now putting your &quot;owed&quot; tax money on the sidelines and out of the market). I&#39;d be lying if I said I haven&#39;t tried to time the market, and 99% of the time I&#39;ve done this I have regretted it. </p>\n\n<p>My advice is if your investing in eth, have a long-term horizon (5-10 years), accumulate where you can, inform yourself as much as you can on the space and let eth do the heavy lifting.

Sure, there's real value and potential, which consistently grows over time, but that fundamental baseline plays a small part in determining the current price.  More than anything, the chart is a record of psychological states and their natural progression.  The psychology of speculation has a consistent internal structure, which manifests as repeated fractal patterns.

Here's the secret: the more you zoom out, the more predictable the market becomes.  If you're here, you probably recognize that crypto has Internet-rivaling potential to transform economic life on Earth.  Yes, it really is a \"new paradigm,\" and you've recognized that before most others.  Among cryptocurrencies, ETH is the one most clearly positioned to play an indispensable role in that transformation.  \n\nCan any of this help you today, when things admittedly don't feel great?  I believe it can.  If I were a BTC whale, a whale group, or The Composite Man, I wouldn't want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, but I wouldn't want recent investors to feel secure either.  I'd try to convince them that the 2017 ATH might not hold.  To do that, I'd push the price uncomfortably close to that level.

That's the reasoning behind the $1430 estimate I provided recently.

The reverse repo scare, the everything bubble, persistent inflation, etc.  Won't those factors make the whole market crash, including crypto?  I do think we'll see a spectacular failure of the system, followed by a reconfiguration of the international monetary order.  The thing is, the timing of that avalanche is unpredictable, and evidence indicates people will tolerate a lot before they give up on the status quo.  Observers have been making rational arguments that the collapse is imminent since 2008 (when the rational market...you know...died).  Here's where they go wrong: the world economy is a confidence game, not a system that operates according to immutable laws found in textbooks.  Economists are witch doctors (I know this because I'm one myself).  For now, the only reality that matters is that the central banks are very much in charge.  They're moving deck chairs on the Titanic, but they're doing so with unquestioned authority.  \n\nRecognizing the potentially dire consequences of unchecked printing, the money masters are making a show of being responsible.
