I don't see the alETH and alBTC vaults dramatically affecting revenue until we get the PoS merge and the demand for borrowing ETH to stake it pull the rates up. The alUSD debt cap is limited by the transmuter funds at this point. The initial ALCX prices and debt cap created an enormous nest egg of DAI in the transmuter because of people liquidating DAI for alUSD to farm ALCX. That incentive died with the price of ALCX. Now farming alUSD is just about on par with farming LUSD or a few other projects. If you lift the debt ceiling dramatically now you just dilute the DAI and alUSD farming rates and risk the alUSD peg in the process. So I expect we'll see DAI in the transmuter increase by like 10% a year and that will roughly cap the alUSD debt ceiling.\n\nWe'll see alETH and alBTC dramatically increase TVL without a huge impact on revenue in the short term. Then when the PoS merge is done and the staking rates spike due to tips we'll see a huge demand for ETH for staking. This will lead to rate increases across the board for borrowing ETH. Those rates will allow the alETH debt ceiling to grow 10-20% for the next year or two as well until we're sitting at like 30 million ETH staked. Afterwards the rates will fall to something closer to 5% and that'll be the sustainable rate of alETH debt ceiling increases.\n\nIn the next few years I expect we'll see some $50 ALCX at some point, even as the market cap grows due to the circulating supply constantly inflating. I don't see where you're getting 20x compounding ALCX. The days of 200% APR on the ALCX/ETH pair appear to be gone. So maybe you get 100% over the next 2 years; compounding that gets your 400% more ALCX, but the ALCX price might be 1/6 of what it is now.\n\nI'm excited to use their platform but I'm only building an ALCX position by holding an ETH/ALCX LP and effectively selling some ETH into ALCX over time, while flipping all my ALCX rewards back to ETH to cover the IL cost. I'll reevaluate this position in December and we can look at the next year of revenue, debasement cost, etc and do another easy calculation. For now, the inflation is orders of magnitude more than the revenue so it's not a hot buy to me.

Now farming alUSD is just about on par with farming LUSD or a few other projects. If you lift the debt ceiling dramatically now you just dilute the DAI and alUSD farming rates and risk the alUSD peg in the process. So I expect we&#39;ll see DAI in the transmuter increase by like 10% a year and that will roughly cap the alUSD debt ceiling.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll see alETH and alBTC dramatically increase TVL without a huge impact on revenue in the short term. Then when the PoS merge is done and the staking rates spike due to tips we&#39;ll see a huge demand for ETH for staking. This will lead to rate increases across the board for borrowing ETH. Those rates will allow the alETH debt ceiling to grow 10-20% for the next year or two as well until we&#39;re sitting at like 30 million ETH staked. Afterwards the rates will fall to something closer to 5% and that&#39;ll be the sustainable rate of alETH debt ceiling increases.</p>\n\n<p>In the next few years I expect we&#39;ll see some $50 ALCX at some point, even as the market cap grows due to the circulating supply constantly inflating. I don&#39;t see where you&#39;re getting 20x compounding ALCX. The days of 200% APR on the ALCX/ETH pair appear to be gone. So maybe you get 100% over the next 2 years; compounding that gets your 400% more ALCX, but the ALCX price might be 1/6 of what it is now.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m excited to use their platform but I&#39;m only building an ALCX position by holding an ETH/ALCX LP and effectively selling some ETH into ALCX over time, while flipping all my ALCX rewards back to ETH to cover the IL cost. I&#39;ll reevaluate this position in December and we can look at the next year of revenue, debasement cost, etc and do another easy calculation. For now, the inflation is orders of magnitude more than the revenue so it&#39;s not a hot buy to me. Good luck though!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-28 15:19:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h3dg714","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o9dd0z","parent_id":"t1_h3d8ukf","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Would award this if i could.
