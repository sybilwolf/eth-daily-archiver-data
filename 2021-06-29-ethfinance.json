Below you can find my first post from Wednesday, so its almost a week in and we are still on track. \n\n>So if wyckhoff plays out BTC  \n\\- today probably retests 32k **(32,3k CHECK)**  \n\\- then rises to 34,5k or so **(35,3k CHECK)**  \n\\- down to 32,5k **(well, down CHECK)**  \n\\- then rises to 37k **(we are here and on our way)**  \n\\- down to 35k  \n\\- breaks 40k within the next 7-10 days.  \nif we stay in the 0.06 range then that would mean ETH 2,4k in 7-10 days as well, but I guess especially when BTC breaks 40k we could see some good ETH moves as well.  \nDisclaimer: i have no idea regarding TA, just basing my thoughts on the wyckhoff patterns (which obviously could be wrong or break at some point).\n\nSo some additional thoughts: \n\nWhats gonna happen after we break 40k? Theory says we are about to go up even further. In this case this is of course BTC only, but I guess the market will go in a similar direction. Sometimes BTC takes the whole air out of the market and alts stall, sometimes they pump even harder. I cant really make a prediction, but since alts have been bleeding out I am not too worried if you have high MC alt bags. \n\nI also did some more research and there are two things that find very interesting. \n\n1. Wyckoff seems to be a fairly common pattern in crypto, both accumulation and redistribution. This is surprising and not surprising at all. Surprising because at least I wasnt aware of Wyckoff before. Not surprising because its a market that is easily manipulated and thus people will take advantage and increase their holdings. I guess professional traders couldnt ask for a better market because if dog coins are driving the market these whales know they can easily drive weak hands out to accumulate more. You can find several post dating back to 2018 that discuss this, mostly \"redistribution\" but still. \n2. There are several variations of Wyckoff accumulation patterns. See for example this [post](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method). You can see that the in the second variation there is no \"spring\" = no lower low after the first crash. So identifying future accumulation phases might be harder, at least for some one like me. \n\nSo lets see how far up ETH can go while BTC slowly crawls back to 40-42k. I guess since the pattern was mostly (!) close to theory there should be a \"mini bear trap\", but after that we should go up again, and then its sideways, break out, everybody happy, ATHs, desk shitting etc. That being said: There is obviously no guarantee! But we will find out sooner or later :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here we go, (almost) daily Wyckoff update. Below you can find my first post from Wednesday, so its almost a week in and we are still on track. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So if wyckhoff plays out BTC<br/>\n- today probably retests 32k <strong>(32,3k CHECK)</strong><br/>\n- then rises to 34,5k or so <strong>(35,3k CHECK)</strong><br/>\n- down to 32,5k <strong>(well, down CHECK)</strong><br/>\n- then rises to 37k <strong>(we are here and on our way)</strong><br/>\n- down to 35k<br/>\n- breaks 40k within the next 7-10 days.<br/>\nif we stay in the 0.06 range then that would mean ETH 2,4k in 7-10 days as well, but I guess especially when BTC breaks 40k we could see some good ETH moves as well.<br/>\nDisclaimer: i have no idea regarding TA, just basing my thoughts on the wyckhoff patterns (which obviously could be wrong or break at some point).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So some additional thoughts: </p>\n\n<p>Whats gonna happen after we break 40k? Theory says we are about to go up even further. In this case this is of course BTC only, but I guess the market will go in a similar direction. Sometimes BTC takes the whole air out of the market and alts stall, sometimes they pump even harder. I cant really make a prediction, but since alts have been bleeding out I am not too worried if you have high MC alt bags. </p>\n\n<p>I also did some more research and there are two things that find very interesting. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Wyckoff seems to be a fairly common pattern in crypto, both accumulation and redistribution. This is surprising and not surprising at all. Surprising because at least I wasnt aware of Wyckoff before. Not surprising because its a market that is easily manipulated and thus people will take advantage and increase their holdings. I guess professional traders couldnt ask for a better market because if dog coins are driving the market these whales know they can easily drive weak hands out to accumulate more. You can find several post dating back to 2018 that discuss this, mostly &quot;redistribution&quot; but still. </li>\n<li>There are several variations of Wyckoff accumulation patterns. See for example this <a href=\"https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method\">post</a>. You can see that the in the second variation there is no &quot;spring&quot; = no lower low after the first crash. So identifying future accumulation phases might be harder, at least for some one like me. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So lets see how far up ETH can go while BTC slowly crawls back to 40-42k. I guess since the pattern was mostly (!) close to theory there should be a &quot;mini bear trap&quot;, but after that we should go up again, and then its sideways, break out, everybody happy, ATHs, desk shitting etc. That being said: There is obviously no guarantee! But we will find out sooner or later :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-29 00:07:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h3eyb4d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oa1foh","parent_id":"t3_oa1foh","score":50,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/RestStopRumble","body":"Thanks for posting.

The marketing is pretty lame indeed, but their products can be judged on merits.\n\nTheir Polygon PoS chain isn't great. Like you said, it's not clear how it's GoodForEthereum\u2122. Copy geth + increase gas limit and block frequency + PoS backed by futility token. Enormous trade offs are made to yield 8X throughput compared to Ethereum today. One has to wonder what the plan is to manage state growth. As far as I can tell, I don't even have the option to run a node except maybe if i ask permission. One good thing I will say is that it did give people a taste of scalability, but clearly the trade offs made are steep. It's borderline custodial. People should definitely be aware of that.\n\nAll that being said, I'm not hugely concerned. \"Real\" EVM L2s are releasing soon and they will blow Polygon out of the water. Fewer security assumptions, and more importantly to retail users, higher throughput. All the popular dapps will be deploying on them and likely luring liquidity with incentives.\n\nAs for Avail, I have my reservations but I generally I think it could be GoodForEthereum\u2122 until sharding is implemented. It will help L2s scale more, sooner. However, it will be important for people to be aware of the assumptions introduced when relying on it.\n\nAt the end of the day what we want is to get closer to a decentralized, trust minimized, open, transparent future. Trade offs will have to be made along the way until we can engineer out of them.

Like you said, it&#39;s not clear how it&#39;s GoodForEthereum\u2122. Copy geth + increase gas limit and block frequency + PoS backed by futility token. Enormous trade offs are made to yield 8X throughput compared to Ethereum today. One has to wonder what the plan is to manage state growth. As far as I can tell, I don&#39;t even have the option to run a node except maybe if i ask permission. One good thing I will say is that it did give people a taste of scalability, but clearly the trade offs made are steep. It&#39;s borderline custodial. People should definitely be aware of that.</p>\n\n<p>All that being said, I&#39;m not hugely concerned. &quot;Real&quot; EVM L2s are releasing soon and they will blow Polygon out of the water. Fewer security assumptions, and more importantly to retail users, higher throughput. All the popular dapps will be deploying on them and likely luring liquidity with incentives.</p>\n\n<p>As for Avail, I have my reservations but I generally I think it could be GoodForEthereum\u2122 until sharding is implemented. It will help L2s scale more, sooner. However, it will be important for people to be aware of the assumptions introduced when relying on it.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day what we want is to get closer to a decentralized, trust minimized, open, transparent future. Trade offs will have to be made along the way until we can engineer out of them. Let&#39;s just focus on holding projects accountable by educating the community on risks and the values of the space, and try not to cede too much ground which we&#39;ll regret.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-28 23:49:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h3ex2h4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oa1foh","parent_id":"t1_h3eqq3c","score":25,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Whovillage","body":"I agree that in the end decentralized, trust minimized scalability is all that matters.
