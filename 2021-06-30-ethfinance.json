To do this, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Install the Ketchup app on your smartphone (you can also check out the forked app, Ketchup Naturale, if you want additional features like prevention of mined transaction side-fumbling and semiboloid token support).\n\n2. When Ketchup asks you for your seed phrase, physically insert a fucking tomato seed into the headphone jack on your phone. Jam it up there real good. Your phone will read the natural magneto-reluctance of the tomato seed and authenticate you with the smart wallet system.\n\n3. Within the Ketchup wallet interface, which is naturally arranged within a four dimensional hyperbolic space for your convenience, scroll inwards and inwards. Keep scrolling inwards. After five minutes of scrolling inwards, this now concludes your meditative practice.\n\n4. Open up the RugStore smart contract insurance app. Make sure you purchase enough Nails (NAL) to cover your entire Ketchup deposit. These nails help secure the rug to the floor and make it so you can\u2019t get rug pulled.\n\n5. Get out a beef tenderizer - or if a tenderizer is unavailable, a small mallet - and physically pound your Beefballs into salisbury form (if you reside in New York or Hawaii it is illegal to do this process without a proper license, so you will need to find some other recipe instead.) Heat your skillet over medium-high heat, trust me you\u2019ll be steaking your Beefballs in no time. Be aware of EIP-1669, though, which will start to progressively burn your Beefballs if they remain in the pan longer than the reciprial panding period.\n\n6. Retain the tallow that is cooked off of the BBL, but be aware that retaining it may constitute taxable income in your jurisdiction.

To do this, follow these simple steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Install the Ketchup app on your smartphone (you can also check out the forked app, Ketchup Naturale, if you want additional features like prevention of mined transaction side-fumbling and semiboloid token support).</p></li>\n<li><p>When Ketchup asks you for your seed phrase, physically insert a fucking tomato seed into the headphone jack on your phone. Jam it up there real good. Your phone will read the natural magneto-reluctance of the tomato seed and authenticate you with the smart wallet system.</p></li>\n<li><p>Within the Ketchup wallet interface, which is naturally arranged within a four dimensional hyperbolic space for your convenience, scroll inwards and inwards. Keep scrolling inwards. After five minutes of scrolling inwards, this now concludes your meditative practice.</p></li>\n<li><p>Open up the RugStore smart contract insurance app. Make sure you purchase enough Nails (NAL) to cover your entire Ketchup deposit. These nails help secure the rug to the floor and make it so you can\u2019t get rug pulled.</p></li>\n<li><p>Get out a beef tenderizer - or if a tenderizer is unavailable, a small mallet - and physically pound your Beefballs into salisbury form (if you reside in New York or Hawaii it is illegal to do this process without a proper license, so you will need to find some other recipe instead.) Heat your skillet over medium-high heat, trust me you\u2019ll be steaking your Beefballs in no time. Be aware of EIP-1669, though, which will start to progressively burn your Beefballs if they remain in the pan longer than the reciprial panding period.</p></li>\n<li><p>Retain the tallow that is cooked off of the BBL, but be aware that retaining it may constitute taxable income in your jurisdiction.

There are many other reasons for my bullish outlook on Mkr, but these are the main ones for purposes of this post not being to long. Again this is my overall understanding of these protocols, I&#39;ve been doing a deep-dive over the last few months, so feel free to let me know where I am wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, based on what I&#39;ve learned so far I have been accumulating Mkr alongside my Eth and couldn&#39;t be more bullish on it. I think it&#39;s undervalued and is the best play out there currently in the defi blue chip space.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-30 17:20:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h3mic3f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oaq1qj","parent_id":"t1_h3mftt0","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"MakerDAO is top notch.
