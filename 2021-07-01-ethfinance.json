Can be found here (PDF download warning!): https://www.hope.com/content/dam/hope-assets/collateral/BMC-Q2-2021-materials.pdf\n\nThree slides in, they hit you with this:\n\n>**Bitcoin mining uses a negligible\namount of energy,** is rapidly becoming\nmore efficient, and is powered by\na higher mix of sustainable energy\nthan any major country or industry.\n\nYeah, no, it uses a fuckload of energy.\n\n>is rapidly becoming more efficient\n\nI believe they meant inefficient here, as the hashrate rising leads to higher difficulty leads to more miners leads to more electricity consumption. Whoops!\n\nIn the methodology section, they basically asked miners three questions:\n\n1. How much energy does your mining operation consume?\n2. What is the total % of sustainable electricity within your fleet's power generation mix today?\n3. What is the total hashrate of your fleet?\n\nSo essentially, the entire methodology boils down to, we ask the industry that would heavily benefit from lying through their teeth about their energy sustainability how much sustainable energy they consume, without any way to verify it. It also only surveyed 32% of the hashrate.\n\nI see absolutely no reason for why the miners would lie and give a higher % than it actually is. /s\n\nThen add to the mix that this whole charade was kicked off by two billionaires, Elon Musk and Michael Saylor, who both have huge Bitcoin bags and who both personally benefit from having this cheap-ass propaganda. The entire PDF is literally 9 slides. \n\nMy personal highlight: Michael Saylor saying this - \"As I\u2019ve stated before, just because the Bitcoin network is decentralized\ndoesn\u2019t mean it has to be disorganized.\" \n\nIf I had told you a year ago that two billionaires will exert a considerable amount of control over Bitcoin (yes, control about the brand, marketing, propaganda, direction of the asset, etc., is still a form of control!) you'd have laughed at me.\n\nLet's also not forget that the survey was voluntary, meaning that miners that use dirty energy are incentivized to not participate, which has the consequence of skewing the results towards the sustainable side.\n\nAll in all, this joke of a survey is completely meaningless and has no statistically meaningful result because of the obvious flaws in methodology.\n\nOn twitter, bitcoin maxis are already parading this as a win for Bitcoin, as the \"truth\". I fucking hate these grifters.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Lmfao going through the presentation slides of the Bitcoin mining council (aka billionaires taking control over Bitcoin one way or another). Can be found here (PDF download warning!): <a href=\"https://www.hope.com/content/dam/hope-assets/collateral/BMC-Q2-2021-materials.pdf\">https://www.hope.com/content/dam/hope-assets/collateral/BMC-Q2-2021-materials.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Three slides in, they hit you with this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Bitcoin mining uses a negligible\namount of energy,</strong> is rapidly becoming\nmore efficient, and is powered by\na higher mix of sustainable energy\nthan any major country or industry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, no, it uses a fuckload of energy.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>is rapidly becoming more efficient</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe they meant inefficient here, as the hashrate rising leads to higher difficulty leads to more miners leads to more electricity consumption. Whoops!</p>\n\n<p>In the methodology section, they basically asked miners three questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How much energy does your mining operation consume?</li>\n<li>What is the total % of sustainable electricity within your fleet&#39;s power generation mix today?</li>\n<li>What is the total hashrate of your fleet?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So essentially, the entire methodology boils down to, we ask the industry that would heavily benefit from lying through their teeth about their energy sustainability how much sustainable energy they consume, without any way to verify it. It also only surveyed 32% of the hashrate.</p>\n\n<p>I see absolutely no reason for why the miners would lie and give a higher % than it actually is. /s</p>\n\n<p>Then add to the mix that this whole charade was kicked off by two billionaires, Elon Musk and Michael Saylor, who both have huge Bitcoin bags and who both personally benefit from having this cheap-ass propaganda. The entire PDF is literally 9 slides. </p>\n\n<p>My personal highlight: Michael Saylor saying this - &quot;As I\u2019ve stated before, just because the Bitcoin network is decentralized\ndoesn\u2019t mean it has to be disorganized.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>If I had told you a year ago that two billionaires will exert a considerable amount of control over Bitcoin (yes, control about the brand, marketing, propaganda, direction of the asset, etc., is still a form of control!) you&#39;d have laughed at me.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s also not forget that the survey was voluntary, meaning that miners that use dirty energy are incentivized to not participate, which has the consequence of skewing the results towards the sustainable side.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, this joke of a survey is completely meaningless and has no statistically meaningful result because of the obvious flaws in methodology.</p>\n\n<p>On twitter, bitcoin maxis are already parading this as a win for Bitcoin, as the &quot;truth&quot;.

It's easy to get caught up in the day to day and the ever growing list of things to do but I find that just being thankful for things can really make a big difference when it comes to increasing your \"happiness baseline\" I guess you could call it.

A lot of people feel obliged to get a degree or to follow their family's long running line of business just to meet people's or societies expectations.
