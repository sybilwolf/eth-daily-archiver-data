There is no token for this one (yet) but this is a new Defi primitive that you might want to be aware of. The basic idea is to split your yield bearing asset into 2 parts, a principal token that can be redeemed for what you put in at expiry, and a yield token that can be redeemed for all the profit on your yield bearing asset.\n\nTheir starting yield bearing asset is LUSD3CRV-f which is a [Curve pool LP](https://curve.fi/lusd) for Liquities LUSD token. This token earns fees from people trading but critically there is also a [Yearn vault](https://yearn.fi/invest) that is currently earning 9.54% by farming and selling CRV.   \n\nWhen you mint using element you get 2 tokens:\n\nePyvCurveLUSD-27DEC21: Element **Principal** yearn vault Liquid USD expiring Dec 27, 2021. This is the **P** token.\n\neYyvCurveLUSD-27DEC21: Element **Yield** yearn vault Liquid USD expiring Dec 27, 2021. This is the **Y** token.\n\nThe yv portion of that token name indicates that the LUSD3CRV-f token you provide is deposited into the yearn vault. That\u2019s where it gets the yield the Y token accrues.\n\nSo let\u2019s dig into some use cases using numbers on their dashboard.\n\n1) **Fixed Rate Lending**\n\nNaturally, since the P token is just dead capital until expiry people are going to sell it. This leads to a price on the principal asset that is strictly less than the principal you can claim with it but which should be 1:1 at expiry time. Right now the P token is valued at 0.9722. They do the math for you regarding price and duration assuming it will be 1.0 at expiry and provide an APR for those buying the P token: [7.87%](https://save.element.fi/). I\u2019ll note that Blockfi just cut their rates to 7.5%, so if you want to pull some capital out from there and buy some P token here you can let Blockfi know you thought that was uncool by voting with your wallet.\n\nIn the simple case you just hold this until December then claim for fun and profit. However, if you\u2019re hungry for more gains you can also monitor the rate over time and trade in and out of this asset between now and expiry. You\u2019re going to eat some trading fees but just last night the rate was as low as 5.87% while I was looking at it so that\u2019s quite a bit of volatility.\n\n2) **Rate speculation**\n\nWhomever is minting this token right now is probably doing so because they believe they can get more than 7.87% on the asset between now and expiry. They are long *the rate*. When they sell they have their LUSD3CRV-f token back less 2.78% of their capital and they still have their Y token which we\u2019ll talk about more in a second. The simple thing to do would just be to deposit the remaining capital to the yearn vault and earn 9.54%. If the rate holds you walk away with some profit. But this wouldn\u2019t be a good post without some amount of lunacy so here we go\u2026\n\nFirst I will note the very shallow liquidity of the Y token pool at $20,557 simply isn\u2019t going to let me trade $10k LUSD3CRV-f for Y tokens.. That makes some sense because the people minting the P tokens are generally long rate so they are likely holding their Y tokens so we don\u2019t expect the liquidity pool to be very deep. Therefore if we want more Y tokens we\u2019re probably going to have to get them by minting\u2026 a lot. Where there is recursion in Defi there is a use case for flash loans. So if you really believe the rates are going to be higher than 7.87%\u2026 you want to turn $10k LUSD3CRV-f into y tokens.\n\na) The P token price is 0.9722.\n\nb) Borrow 10k/(1-.9722)~=$360k stablecoin as a flash loan.\n\nc) mint LUSD3CRV-f worth ~ 360k\n\nd) Mint $360k*.9722=~$350k P token.\n\ne) Sell the P tokens and your original $10k LUSD3CRF-f  and repay the loan.\n\nf) Keep Y tokens minted from 360k in principal until expiry.\n\ng) Redeem for fun and profit.\n\nFor simplicity let\u2019s say the rates averaged 10% over the next ~6 months. The Y tokens you redeem be worth ~18k for your original 10k investment giving you an 80% gain over  6 months, 160% APR. *Nice*. That\u2019s how we do it using Defi. I\u2019m clearly ignoring some factors such as trading fees, slippage, etc. It\u2019s an illustration of the concept.\n\n3) **LP**\n\nYo dawg, I heard you liked speculating. Instead of speculating on the rates you can speculate on the speculators speculating on the rates by being an LP in the pools for the above tokens. This not only makes some profit on the LUSD3CRV-f tokens from Curve but also people trading the P and Y tokens over time. There should be steady trading volume on the P token pool over time because the value should go from .9722 to 1 over 6 months.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the LUSD3CRV-f/ePyvCurveLUSD-27DEC21 (god I love Defi) pool then you stand to make trading fees on this correction and profit from rate volatility and speculation in the market from people like 2) above.\n\nUnfortunately, it does sacrifice the rates from the yearn vault on half your capital sitting in the AMM because for some reason the AMM uses LUSD3CRV-f and not yvCurveLUSD. I asked about this on their discord. You can read their reply [here](https://discord.com/channels/754739461707006013/826211846541148211/860407531187470346).\n\nI\u2019m even less convinced on LPing the Y pool but they write an article on this that might convince you more than me [here](https://medium.com/element-finance/the-automated-fixed-rate-rebalancer-1bf78010dce9).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Alright, so let\u2019s dive a bit into <a href=\"https://www.element.fi/\">Element</a>.
