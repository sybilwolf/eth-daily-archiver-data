Customers are incentivized by being able to buy, at a disclosed markup, ETH (or any liquid ERC-20).\n\n2. \"Vendors\", who take fiat from the customer and certify to a smart contract that they did so, and the exact amount. Vendors are incentivized by keeping as a fee the disclosed markup portion of the fiat they receive from customers.\n\n3. \"Brokers\", who receive fiat from the vendors on an at-will basis, use it to acquire ETH, and move this ETH into RampDAO. Brokers are incentivized by keeping as a fee a portion of the fiat they receive from vendors. They are responsible for moving an amount of ETH into the RampDAO system in proportion to the amount of fiat they receive from vendors by an adjustable deadline. Brokers are required to stake ETH as insurance against failing to inject new ETH within the deadline.\n\n4. \"Liquidity Providers\", who supply the actual ETH given to the customers. LPs are incentivized by receiving rewards on the ETH they stake, including a governance token.\n\nThe system's function in a nutshell:\n\n1. LPs lock their ETH in a liquidity pool from which customers receive their ETH. This enables customers to receive ETH as fast as possible.\n\n2. Vendors record into a smart contract the amount of fiat they received/sent, and to which broker they sent it.\n\n3. Brokers, **upon agreement to receive fiat**, are then on the hook for moving a commensurate amount of crypto into the pool. In other words if they fail to do so within a deadline, it increases their risk of being liquidated. Ideally they deposit ETH immediately into the DAO to replenish the pool. In cases that they don't have enough ETH on hand, when they accumulate enough fiat to make doing so financially sound, they must buy ETH through existing channels (OTC or exchange) and send it to the DAO to replenish the pool. Brokers who fail to replenish the pool within a DAO-adjustable deadline have their staked ETH liquidated. This mechanism ensures there will be enough ETH in the pool to cover the LPs' deposits.\n\nA convenience store owner could maximize their profit by being an LP, a broker, and a vendor, all at the same time. Such an owner could also be a broker to other convenience store owners who would act only as vendors.\n\nInside a convenience store, when a customer wants to purchase ETH, the cashier first has to authorize an ETH transaction in order to create/activate a new \"ETH virtual gift card\".\n\nThe cashier inputs into an app: 1) the amount of ETH the customer wants to buy, and 2) a PIN code chosen by the customer at time of purchase.\n\nThese two inputs are used to dynamically generate a webpage used by the cashier. This page interacts with a smart contract, which after the cahsier authorizes the transaction, 1) creates a new ETH account, 2) transfers the appropriate amount of ETH into it, and 3) creates a QR code for use by the paying customer only.\n\nThis QR code, when scanned by the customer, takes them to a URL where they are prompted to enter the PIN chosen a few moments ago (this page also displays prominently a confirmation of whether it has been accessed before to prevent e.g. corrupt vendors from trying to sell already-spent gift cards). Upon entry of the correct PIN, another QR code is shown, which contains the private key to the newly minted ETH address, to be imported into the customer's phone wallet.\n\nThe convenience store owner decides exactly what premium they want to charge on top of current exchange rate for ETH.\n\nNotes on anonymity: LPs can retain complete anonymity while profiting from this system. Brokers likely can't be anonymous because they have to have a way of receiving fiat from vendors and acquiring crypto, which will mean registering with a bank and crypto exchange, respectively. Vendors can't be anonymous because they are operating legitimate businesses. Customers might be able to retain a degree of anonymity depending on the policies of the vendor, e.g. does the vendor accept cash for crypto without ID.\n\nVectors for exploitation: If multiple vendors continually sent fiat to a broker who was in default, and had no intention of repaying, it would potentially create a loss for the LPs. This could be prevented in a number of ways, such as by having the smart contract refuse the transaction if the broker was in default, or by creating a reputation/credit score system (perhaps using LINK) for brokers. It might also be a good idea to have vendors stake ETH as well, and penalize them if they chose to send fiat to a broker who was in default/low reputation, when other brokers were available.\n\n*(the name RampDAO is already in use by some BSC shitcoin, so a different name will have to be chosen)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Outline for &quot;RampDAO&quot;*, a smart contract-enforced fiat on-ramp: </p>\n\n<p>There are four entities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>&quot;Customers&quot;, who pay in fiat at a point of sale in order to receive ETH.

Vendors can&#39;t be anonymous because they are operating legitimate businesses. Customers might be able to retain a degree of anonymity depending on the policies of the vendor, e.g. does the vendor accept cash for crypto without ID.</p>\n\n<p>Vectors for exploitation: If multiple vendors continually sent fiat to a broker who was in default, and had no intention of repaying, it would potentially create a loss for the LPs. This could be prevented in a number of ways, such as by having the smart contract refuse the transaction if the broker was in default, or by creating a reputation/credit score system (perhaps using LINK) for brokers. It might also be a good idea to have vendors stake ETH as well, and penalize them if they chose to send fiat to a broker who was in default/low reputation, when other brokers were available.</p>\n\n<p>*(the name RampDAO is already in use by some BSC shitcoin, so a different name will have to be chosen)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-04 20:27:27","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-07-04 20:39:06","id":"h43c4v0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oddn3f","parent_id":"t1_h41o1ve","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"Wow. :) \nIn my mind this wouldn\u2019t start as a DAO and I guess the example is for a certain regional audience (e.g. in Europe convenience stores are probably not the go-to FIAT on ramp).
