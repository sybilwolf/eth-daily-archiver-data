I obviously have a bias, but the Lattice1 was designed to address the security and user experience shortcomings of Ledger and Trezor when it comes to Ethereum and smart contract chains in particular.\n\nThey were designed for basic Bitcoin sends, not using DeFi, NFTs, etc.. so, why does this matter for the average user?\n\nThose devices are not providing hardware security for modern Ethereum signing requests like EIP-712 which they are doing in the browser instead (but you approve on the device so you have the impression of it being hardware secured).\n\nAlso, to get a security benefit from any hardware wallet, you will need to carefully verify what you're signing on the secure screen. With a Bitcoin wallet this can mean verifying over 100 screens of hexadecimal strings. Most people don't do this, which makes their hardware wallet essentially the equivalent of a security blanket - it makes you feel good to hold it, but isn't doing much.\n\nFurther, Trezor doesn't have a secure enclave chipset and doesn't take the physical security of your device into account with your threat model - this is fine if you're not worried about a motivated party getting their hands on your hardware wallet, but it's not appropriate for storing a lot of value.\n\nThat said, it is still better to store your keys on a secure device instead of your computer or phone in any case. So those devices will provide a marginal benefit. I recommend that no one use Trezor (and KeepKey which is based on it), but Ledger would be an improvement for using with Bitcoin and value transfer only chains.\n\nFor Ethereum, it's L2s, and other EVM chains like Polygon, the Lattice1 is the best choice for security and usability. It's more expensive, but it also replaces the functionality of multiple legacy hardware wallets so it's a bit of a wash since the SafeCards are a secure replacement for additional hardware wallets and insecure paper and metal seed phrase backups.\n\nAs a self-described super noob it might seem like a bit much, but it is the only device providing hardware security for all of your Ethereum signing and it will grow and evolve with the ecosystem and your future needs.\n\nPS - Full Lattice1 support will be rolled into the official MetaMask client soon.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey, this is Justin from GridPlus. I obviously have a bias, but the Lattice1 was designed to address the security and user experience shortcomings of Ledger and Trezor when it comes to Ethereum and smart contract chains in particular.</p>\n\n<p>They were designed for basic Bitcoin sends, not using DeFi, NFTs, etc.. so, why does this matter for the average user?</p>\n\n<p>Those devices are not providing hardware security for modern Ethereum signing requests like EIP-712 which they are doing in the browser instead (but you approve on the device so you have the impression of it being hardware secured).</p>\n\n<p>Also, to get a security benefit from any hardware wallet, you will need to carefully verify what you&#39;re signing on the secure screen. With a Bitcoin wallet this can mean verifying over 100 screens of hexadecimal strings. Most people don&#39;t do this, which makes their hardware wallet essentially the equivalent of a security blanket - it makes you feel good to hold it, but isn&#39;t doing much.</p>\n\n<p>Further, Trezor doesn&#39;t have a secure enclave chipset and doesn&#39;t take the physical security of your device into account with your threat model - this is fine if you&#39;re not worried about a motivated party getting their hands on your hardware wallet, but it&#39;s not appropriate for storing a lot of value.</p>\n\n<p>That said, it is still better to store your keys on a secure device instead of your computer or phone in any case. So those devices will provide a marginal benefit. I recommend that no one use Trezor (and KeepKey which is based on it), but Ledger would be an improvement for using with Bitcoin and value transfer only chains.</p>\n\n<p>For Ethereum, it&#39;s L2s, and other EVM chains like Polygon, the Lattice1 is the best choice for security and usability. It&#39;s more expensive, but it also replaces the functionality of multiple legacy hardware wallets so it&#39;s a bit of a wash since the SafeCards are a secure replacement for additional hardware wallets and insecure paper and metal seed phrase backups.</p>\n\n<p>As a self-described super noob it might seem like a bit much, but it is the only device providing hardware security for all of your Ethereum signing and it will grow and evolve with the ecosystem and your future needs.</p>\n\n<p>PS - Full Lattice1 support will be rolled into the official MetaMask client soon.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-06 08:57:09","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-07-06 09:04:20","id":"h48zipz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oeo547","parent_id":"t1_h48hmun","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Oh wow thanks for this informative post!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Oh wow thanks for this informative post!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-06 09:04:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h490jgh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oeo547","parent_id":"t1_h48zipz","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"cc /u/hashtagfuzzmaster might like this reply too.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>cc <a href=\"/u/hashtagfuzzmaster\">/u/hashtagfuzzmaster</a> might like this reply too.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-06 09:01:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h4903mr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oeo547","parent_id":"t1_h48zipz","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hashtagfuzzmaster","body":"Thanks fellas very informative.
