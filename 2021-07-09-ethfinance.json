The fresh air of nature usually energizes me and gives you the extra boost when you&#39;re in the thick of it. Hope the bike trail has some good views.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t eat too heavy, bring snacks (beef jerky, trail mix), bring <strong>lots</strong> of water. People often underestimate how much water they need. Whenever I bring someone new to hiking, they usually bring 2 bottles/canteens of water thinking that&#39;s going to be enough. They realize their mistake before we reach the half way point and they have already ran out of water. It&#39;s better to be over prepared than under. </p>\n\n<p>Also remember to share the pics here on <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a>. For some strange reason, camping,holding, nature and <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a> have formed a strange symbiosis.

Keep in mind they currently own a large amount of ETHE.

I would say the simplest explanation for why there are questions is because of it\u2019s perpetual motion machine-like security guarantee. Proof of work has explicit costs that are independent of the network mechanics that are being used to secure the network. Proof of stake relies on this internal \u2018snake eating its tail.\u2019 It relies on the underlying assets themselves to secure the network, but the security of the network is only a function of the value of those assets. It\u2019s so \u2018secure\u2019 where you have everyone staking it, and the value is so high that it becomes unusable as a store of value or mechanism to transfer because most of it is being staked. \n\n\nI\u2019m not an expert in the mechanics of proof of stake, but what I can say is that it offers nowhere near the censorship resistance guarantees that proof of work offers - because there isn\u2019t that provable explicit cost. Miners for instance in proof of work are spending billions of dollars upfront to build out the network. Proof of stake converges towards a plutocracy where you have a few stakeholders buying up all of the liquidity of the network and bonding it to secure the network. It becomes a matter of \u2018who has more money\u2019 versus \u2018who is willing to take more risk and have skin in the game\u2019 in explicit costs to secure the network. \n\n\nYou can imagine a scenario where there is an on-chain governance mechanism baked into the network where the largest holders are the ones dictating the future.The people who are able to buy it up are the ones controlling the network. Whereas with bitcoin, it doesn\u2019t matter how much you hold - you\u2019re not going to change the network because the security is not bound to your holdings\u201d\n\n\nStarts at 47:12,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6nxY8ycuPU","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wanted to get your opinions on this interview with the crypto analyst of ARK Invest.

Proof of work has explicit costs that are independent of the network mechanics that are being used to secure the network. Proof of stake relies on this internal \u2018snake eating its tail.\u2019 It relies on the underlying assets themselves to secure the network, but the security of the network is only a function of the value of those assets. It\u2019s so \u2018secure\u2019 where you have everyone staking it, and the value is so high that it becomes unusable as a store of value or mechanism to transfer because most of it is being staked. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not an expert in the mechanics of proof of stake, but what I can say is that it offers nowhere near the censorship resistance guarantees that proof of work offers - because there isn\u2019t that provable explicit cost. Miners for instance in proof of work are spending billions of dollars upfront to build out the network. Proof of stake converges towards a plutocracy where you have a few stakeholders buying up all of the liquidity of the network and bonding it to secure the network. It becomes a matter of \u2018who has more money\u2019 versus \u2018who is willing to take more risk and have skin in the game\u2019 in explicit costs to secure the network. </p>\n\n<p>You can imagine a scenario where there is an on-chain governance mechanism baked into the network where the largest holders are the ones dictating the future.The people who are able to buy it up are the ones controlling the network. Whereas with bitcoin, it doesn\u2019t matter how much you hold - you\u2019re not going to change the network because the security is not bound to your holdings\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Starts at 47:12,  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6nxY8ycuPU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6nxY8ycuPU</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-09 16:03:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h4n7yro","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ogokg5","parent_id":"t3_ogokg5","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"LOL, where do people get these arguments.

It's nonsensical to claim that proof of work is less plutocratic, when you have to spend millions of dollars on hardware to be competitive against other people who are also spending millions of dollars to do the same. Also, for a proof of work network, once a bad actor invests enough money, or bands together with enough people, to 51% attack the network, they can keep doing it indefinitely because they get to keep the hardware. With proof of stake, from what Vitalik says, if someone gets enough ETH to 51% attack the network, they'll only be able to do so one time before getting slashed.
