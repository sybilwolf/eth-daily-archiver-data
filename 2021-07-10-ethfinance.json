The IRS is going to want you to report the income on that interest *at the time it was earned*.

When you trade/redeem stETH later, you can pay the difference in fair market value on what you've earned. The terrible downside to this approach is the price of ETH tends to vary more than the appreciation of ETH within stETH, so the majority of what you end up owing in a few years isn't the interest from stETH at all, but the price appreciate on all the ETH of your position.\n\nRule of thumb for me is if the underlying value changes, treat it as a token swap. If the underlying value doesn't, then it is hard to make an argument that you are disposing of the original asset, treat it as a deposit.
