This family of rate speculation platforms all operate on the idea of depositing a token they can generate yield with and then they mint some form of Principal and Yield token pair which you can use to speculate on rates in various ways.\n\nTo start with, if you haven\u2019t already read my [Element post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/oc37iy/daily_general_discussion_july_2_2021/h3u7bty/) do that first. I\u2019ll be using Element as the baseline for comparison because it is the most straightforward.\n\n[Element](https://docs.element.fi/) gets yield from Yearn finance which is cool because yearn has an affiliate fee program where they give partners some of their 20% fee for bringing liquidity to their platform. These affiliate fees are what funds Element\u2019s treasury/development. Generally this is yield you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to if you used Yearn directly so it\u2019s nothing lost and is an all around good solution. Otherwise, Element has no fees, and no discrete plans to add them which is unique (though they could add one to their Balancer pool if they chose).\n\nElement\u2019s P + Y token setup is the most straightforward. The Y token is going to be valued at what it can speculatively be redeemed for minus the cost of time (why buy $1 worth of a yield token that can only be redeemed for $1 some time later when I could just earn interest on my $1 instead). The P token is similarly valued at the time cost of that money; that\u2019s how it offers the fixed rate lending use case.\n\nAs I poke fun at in my intro post, the pools have ridiculous symbol names. It\u2019s important to know for comparison that half the LP is a non-interest bearing asset. I\u2019ll come back to this when discussing capital efficiency tradeoffs. \n\nElement is unique in that it deliberately offers no early redemption process whereby you could claim the underlying value of the tokens before expiry. As with all one way bridges this creates a price ceiling on the P and T tokens but no price floor. As to why they did this:\n\n>We do not support early redemptions, one reason is to reinforce time as a variable and not to penalize users (typical early redemptions punish users in trad markets).\n\nI don\u2019t have the data to back that up, but there ya go.\n\nSo, let\u2019s compare this to [Pendle](https://docs.pendle.finance/). Pendle\u2019s Y token isn\u2019t directly redeemable for yield. Instead your yield for each pool is redeemable on their dashboard given the duration of time that you have held the Y token. Think of it like farming, you hold/stake a token, you get paid every block, and can claim anytime you wish. Naturally, since the Y token isn\u2019t redeemable for anything, it\u2019s value decays to 0 at expiry. This makes the Y token resemble something closer to an options platform which may be what they were going for.\n\nThe downside is this adds gas accounting to the ERC-20 token itself making each send/trade more expensive and of course this means they needed to make a custom AMM because a normal Liquidity Pool where one of the assets is purposefully going to zero is going to be rather devoid of liquidity after the first round of people get burned. So, it creates more transactions, each transaction is more expensive, and they had to write a custom AMM which has added more smart contract risk. In addition to this Pendle takes 3% of the yield and 0.05% of the volume on the AMM for themselves. The upside is you get a Pendle token you can farm and flip unlike Element which has none. In the sake of fairness, here\u2019s what they said:\n\n>Yes you are correct that to be able to do this, both our contract system and the AMM will need to be more complex. However, there are certain benefits. One of those is the simplicity in the definition of YT and flexibility in how you can use it. YT directly represents the right to receive yield from the underlying yield bearing assets over the time period that you hold it, guaranteed on-chain by its exact mechanism. As such, people can hold YT for any period of time that they wish to receive the yield from, and sell it whenever they like. Its value is solely derived from the future yield from this point to the expiry, without any kind of past yield baked in it.\n\nNext up is [Tempus](https://docs.tempus.finance/). Remember how Element had those LP\u2019s that were forfeiting yearn yield on half their balance and I was all emo about it? Well, Tempus fixes that! Instead of having separate B/Y and B/P pools you have a single Y/P pool. Obviously this improves the *capital efficiency* for LP\u2019s (paging /u/davidahoffman ) and is designed to attract more capital. Why wouldn\u2019t you LP at that point? P + Y should equal B because of arbitrage and early redemptions so rather than depositing in yearn with B directly, deposit into Tempus which deposits in yearn for you and you still get your yearn yield plus the trading fees on the liquidity pool! This draws people into the system who aren\u2019t even interested in rate speculation which is a great design.\n\nNow, the downsides. Tempus is going to take some of the yield (starting at 0 but planned for governance in the future). A larger problem is Tempus is planning to directly farm from protocols instead of using Yearn. In theory they could just copy whatever Yearn does and not have to give up 20% of the rake but we both know it\u2019s never that simple with smart contracts. The result is probably going to be less yield on the base asset. For example, let\u2019s say they have an aUSDC pool. Are they going to farm and sell AAVE for you? If so, that\u2019s a *lot* of responsibility they are accepting onto themselves to both maximize yield and run a rate speculation platform. If not, the yield just won\u2019t be competitive, LP fees or not, compared to other stablecoin farms available. I personally think they should change that plan and just go with an alUSD3CRV-f pool to start. They kept mentioning Lido so they\u2019re probably thinking of the stETH LP to start.\n\nLast in line is [APWine](https://docs.apwine.fi/) which I\u2019ve been able to gather fewer details about. What I do have though is incredible so hold onto your butts. What if I get tired of withdrawing, redeeming, depositing, LPing, etc every few months as we roll from expiry to expiry and I just want to earn my comically oversized yields in peace? APWine has you covered on this one. I really think UMA should pay attention and call these guys. Basically instead of having 1 pool per expiry eg: LUSD3CRV-f/ePyvCurveLUSD-27DEC21 they\u2019ll have one pool per base asset with a revolving door of underlying tokens in that pool. I await more details!\n\nWhich system I use is of course going to be wherever I get the highest, safest, yields. We\u2019re all just liquidity locusts around here. We\u2019re looking to park our capital where it\u2019s treated best. That being said, I think the Tempus design is the most exciting while I think Element has the lead in terms of exposure/liquidity.
