The latter is definitely not constant, which you can see in any block explorer.</p>\n\n<p>So the terminology must be exact: is it the target block time, or the actual time of a particular block? The average block time across many blocks will tend to be close to the target block time, and this is the principle used to estimate the time a future block will be mined. However the less frequently difficulty is adjusted the more potential there is for block times to deviate from the target as network hash rate varies.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway it sounds like you already know this stuff and we were each just using the terminology to refer to slightly different things, but I wrote it out anyway for the benefit of others reading.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-14 06:17:41","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-07-14 06:50:08","id":"h55g55t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ojx9si","parent_id":"t1_h55eixm","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-14 08:39:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h55y4wv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ojx9si","parent_id":"t1_h55eixm","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Survivaleast","body":"Getting tired of hiding in my cave.
