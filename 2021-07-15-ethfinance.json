Rather, it seems to me we're in no man's land and general market patterns are mostly playing out according to regular indicators. Macro markets are also important. On the plus side, weekly MACD for BTC doesn't look too bad. In fact, the moving averages are just about crossing the zero line and the MACD itself has gone way more negative than it was at its (positive) peak. Compared to the previous bull cycle, this is actually much \"worse\" already, since previously the negative side was never as strong as the positive side - although it did last for a long time (could this indicate diminishing BTC importance?). As for ETH, while the peak weekly MACD went extremely positive, the negative has yet to catch up - the moving averages aren't even close to the zero line yet. Basically, more downside to come. However, sustained support on the ratio would indicate a momentum shift towards ETH, which could soften further falls unless BTC absolutely shits the bed. IMO this would not be a bad thing as we'd get to see where ETH support really lies. So, probably a few rough weeks ahead as we grind down. Keep an eye on volume as we head lower. I know a lot of you think the flippening cannot happen before new ATH but I am not convinced of this.

In fact, the moving averages are just about crossing the zero line and the MACD itself has gone way more negative than it was at its (positive) peak. Compared to the previous bull cycle, this is actually much &quot;worse&quot; already, since previously the negative side was never as strong as the positive side - although it did last for a long time (could this indicate diminishing BTC importance?). As for ETH, while the peak weekly MACD went extremely positive, the negative has yet to catch up - the moving averages aren&#39;t even close to the zero line yet. Basically, more downside to come. However, sustained support on the ratio would indicate a momentum shift towards ETH, which could soften further falls unless BTC absolutely shits the bed. IMO this would not be a bad thing as we&#39;d get to see where ETH support really lies. So, probably a few rough weeks ahead as we grind down. Keep an eye on volume as we head lower. I know a lot of you think the flippening cannot happen before new ATH but I am not convinced of this. BTC looks weak in the face of growing crypto adoption, and developmentally speaking, ETH is on fire right now.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-15 07:30:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h5a1x5e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oklty4","parent_id":"t3_oklty4","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CosmicCollusion","body":">I'm definitely feeling premature bear ejaculation (I got molested on my last camping trip, don't ask)\n\nYou know saying don't ask is basically an invitation to inquire right?

BTC is going to be below $30k in this scenario so that is going to drag us down as well. </p>\n\n<p>No bounce, retesting prior ATH ($1,400) is going to be the new narrative and IMO likely simply because sentiment will shift causing a self-fulfilling prophecy. I also find it extremely unlikely .06 holds. Which the math behind that is going to be brutal if that happens as well (Go ahead, type even a &#39;modest&#39; $25,000 * .05 into your calculator knowing it could be worse).</p>\n\n<p>This has been a long consolidation so whichever way this breaks it&#39;s probably going to be a sizeable move. I don&#39;t see how we can go below $1,700 and get any notable length of crab movement until new support is found. Not even trying to FUD, but there is real potential for a complete breakdown of the 4 year cycle right now. This is looking less and less like Summer 2017 each weekly candle. Does that mean a 3 year bear with a 95% retrace? No. But we could be in for a really lame 2nd half of 2021. </p>\n\n<p>No need for fear, just plan accordingly for all possibilities.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-15 06:27:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h59trqp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oklty4","parent_id":"t1_h59r83j","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Childsp","body":"Oh look a well defined bear market (potential) post that is getting up votes I wonder what those other scrubs are doing to get all the downvotes for the same.
