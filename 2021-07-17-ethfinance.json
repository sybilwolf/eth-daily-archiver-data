I usually like this sub because it's more discussion based and it's more intellectual than other crypto subs. So I try to only post when I find something that will benefit you guys as much as you guys benefit me. And if I am wrong I get to learn from others.\n\nI did the research and there's no signs of a scam. If you care, here's a few indications that they are a legit project. I got so many down votes though you will probably be the only one reading this at this point. \n\n**Received a Grant from web 3 foundation**: https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted\\_grant\\_applications.md\n\n**Highly Active Twitter with updates:** [https://twitter.com/bifrost\\_finance?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/bifrost_finance?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)  \\- **And being followed by reputable people**\n\n**Their audit was done by certik**: [https://certik-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Certik+Final+Report+for+Biforst.pdf](https://certik-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Certik+Final+Report+for+Biforst.pdf)  **They did have one critical finding but it was fixed; as stated in the report.**\n\n**Highly active Git hub, commits are frequent:** [https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost/graphs/commit-activity](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost/graphs/commit-activity)\n\n**Updated roadmap; with accomplishments:** https://trello.com/b/ApMJHynM/roadmap\n\n**Verified Deposited ETH going to staking contracts:** [https://etherscan.io/address/0xec1d6163e05b3f5d0fb8f354881f6c8b793ad612#internaltx](https://etherscan.io/address/0xec1d6163e05b3f5d0fb8f354881f6c8b793ad612#internaltx)\n\n**Supported by known crypto investors and organizations:** [https://bifrost.finance/#section-partner](https://bifrost.finance/#section-partner)\n\n**Stats for their Parachain auction:** https://parachain.live/ \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe project will be unlocking staked liquidity and bridging it to polkadot. Holding the vETH token gets you the staking rewards and it will all be redeemable when 2.0 is here. I am assuming the price difference is due to the limited amount of ETH they allowed to be deposited which means limited amounts of vETH were minted. Of course all these projects have risk but this one seems as legit as the other's, probably just over looked because the polkadot ecosystem is still being built out. Maybe I am missing something but it looks that simple. I feel comfortable getting more vETH, but of course trust your gut. I hope my only regret will be I didn't pick up more.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for responding. I usually like this sub because it&#39;s more discussion based and it&#39;s more intellectual than other crypto subs. So I try to only post when I find something that will benefit you guys as much as you guys benefit me. And if I am wrong I get to learn from others.</p>\n\n<p>I did the research and there&#39;s no signs of a scam. If you care, here&#39;s a few indications that they are a legit project. I got so many down votes though you will probably be the only one reading this at this point. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Received a Grant from web 3 foundation</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted%5C_grant%5C_applications.md\">https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted\\_grant\\_applications.md</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Highly Active Twitter with updates:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bifrost_finance?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">https://twitter.com/bifrost_finance?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a>  - <strong>And being followed by reputable people</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Their audit was done by certik</strong>: <a href=\"https://certik-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Certik+Final+Report+for+Biforst.pdf\">https://certik-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Certik+Final+Report+for+Biforst.pdf</a>  <strong>They did have one critical finding but it was fixed; as stated in the report.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Highly active Git hub, commits are frequent:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost/graphs/commit-activity\">https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost/graphs/commit-activity</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated roadmap; with accomplishments:</strong> <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/ApMJHynM/roadmap\">https://trello.com/b/ApMJHynM/roadmap</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Verified Deposited ETH going to staking contracts:</strong> <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xec1d6163e05b3f5d0fb8f354881f6c8b793ad612#internaltx\">https://etherscan.io/address/0xec1d6163e05b3f5d0fb8f354881f6c8b793ad612#internaltx</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Supported by known crypto investors and organizations:</strong> <a href=\"https://bifrost.finance/#section-partner\">https://bifrost.finance/#section-partner</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stats for their Parachain auction:</strong> <a href=\"https://parachain.live/\">https://parachain.live/</a> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The project will be unlocking staked liquidity and bridging it to polkadot. Holding the vETH token gets you the staking rewards and it will all be redeemable when 2.0 is here. I am assuming the price difference is due to the limited amount of ETH they allowed to be deposited which means limited amounts of vETH were minted. Of course all these projects have risk but this one seems as legit as the other&#39;s, probably just over looked because the polkadot ecosystem is still being built out.
