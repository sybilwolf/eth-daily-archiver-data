This is coming from someone that has spent thousands of hours across almost every genre of game.\n\nI've heard arguments that sovereign ownership of items is going to revolutionize the industry but if a game client just decides to ignore a given NFT the company has taken away the *usefulness* of your NFT and all you're left with is a struct on a blockchain that no one is going to buy. I'm actually skeptical about most items being tradable. I saw what that did to Diablo 3 at launch. It was more profitable to play the auction house than play the game. If meaningful performance gains can be purchased your game is pay to win.\n\nI have heard that there is going to be a metaverse of items that games will import from one another. I might see this for cosmetics but I'm skeptical that the polygon map of the item is going to be on the blockchain or IPFS. First, the download times to load each item when you encounter something new are going to hurt user experience. These things have to be shipped with the game client. Second, even minor differences in scaling between clients renders this approach useless unless a standard scale is adopted. Third, even that only applies if the games have similar styles. Lastly, even if this was possible from a technical perspective if company A sells the item why should company B support it unless they are also getting paid? Just seems unlikely to happen for me outside a single ecosystem. I can see cosmetics spanning blizzard games but those could be managed using a blizzard database.\n\nWhat I find interesting about this new \"play to earn\" model that is catching on has nothing to do with sovereign ownership or some abstract metaverse concept. It has everything to do with the SLP and AXS Uniswap markets.\n\nBack in the days of UO I was a gold seller. The concept was simple; I was providing improved entertainment quality to people playing that game for cash. The interaction between the game and the real world economy was just terrible. It was a black market over Ebay, it was explicitly against the ToS, scams ran rampant, even if the transaction was successful there was a good chance the gold was stolen/hacked somehow and you were just funding crime. The income was abysmal but child labor is illegal, so there ya go.\n\nAbout a decade later came EVE Online. They made an in game item that could be redeemed to pay the subscription fee. Due to this it had a hard monetary value (or the perception of one). The problem was still that the bridge was one way. There was no in game supported way of selling these items back for cash. It was like buying a gift card at Best Buy. It could be redeemed for $10 of value within their ecosystem but if you just wanted cash out you were still using black markets on Ebay etc. Gift card scams are still rampant, there is a deep discount if you're buying gift cards for cash P2P, it's highly inconvenient, etc.\n\nAFAIK, the new generation of blockchain games such as Axie are the first time we see a two way market in these games. Even in the days of UO I was effectively playing to earn. That's nothing new. An external market however streamlines that experience and make it a canonical option. This is huge, partly because even what was an abysmal wage for me growing up, would have actually been a substantial wage for people making $1 a day if the monetary rails existed for them. Blockchain has provided alternative monetary rails that you can use with just a mobile phone. Combined with the games public market, you can now play to earn. All any game like EVE has to do to get a player bump is tokenize their monthly subscription item and add a deposit/withdrawal system hooked up to a blockchain of their choice.\n\nThis paradigm is seeing an undeniable uptick in new users, especially in harder to reach areas of the world. Money is the great motivator. This is a cultural backdoor into blockchain for likely millions of people. Once Axie starts making public headlines due to its size and revenue other game companies will pay attention. I could see Steam gift cards being tokenized by Valve, WoW subscriptions by Blizzard when they get desperate, game ownership NFT's being tokenized and traded in other games within a publisher, game rental NFT's being tokenized by Gamestop. All that was needed was the monetary rails Ethereum and a DEX provide. We could very well double or triple the number of people with an Ethereum wallet just because of this.\n\nEdit: Self-promoting blog post: https://tokenomicsexplained.com/tokenization-of-games/","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have been a long time skeptic of game item NFT&#39;s.

Last I checked to play Axie Infinity, you need to have 3 axies. I believe this is upwards of $600 just to start playing. For most people that don\u2019t understand the game and won\u2019t do the research, this will probably seem like a large amount to begin playing in order to earn.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s crazy to me that even with this entry fee and the setup to start playing, making new wallets (Metamask and Ronin typically are needed) for most people, bridging over coins and setting up an Axie account, that the game is still growing like crazy. If something is somewhat broken and still growing incredibly fast it says to me that this product must be incredibly innovative.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-19 11:18:25","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-07-19 11:25:42","id":"h5s3x9d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_on795c","parent_id":"t1_h5ryggd","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"I think we agree that we enjoy games more where people have a fair start and people have to earn their way rather than buy their way to the top.

Why not let all avatars start with different looks, but without traits and add them later on? One way could be when an NFT is sold (because technically if I understand stuff correctly, and I have no dev background, so please correct me if I am wrong, then the NFT needs to interact with the contract anyways and you could either replace it with a new NFT with traits or just change the pic connected to the token). Obviously only with a certain %, not all NFTs should evolve all the time. One could be at certain time intervalls, e.g. every year 10% of all NFTs get traits. \nFirst mechanic to increase selling and thus distribution. Second to increase loyalty. \n\n2. don\u2019t sell / mint all NFTs now. If you want to have a collection of 10000 do 10 waves of 1000 each, e.g. every 3 months. Everytime a new wave of 1000 is minted the old ones evolve. Or with each wave 1000 NFTs evolve, so even a new mint could be upgraded (after each wave is sold out \u2014> incentive to mint). Last approach would be more fair. \n\nYou could obv mix the two approaches as well.

Why not let all avatars start with different looks, but without traits and add them later on? One way could be when an NFT is sold (because technically if I understand stuff correctly, and I have no dev background, so please correct me if I am wrong, then the NFT needs to interact with the contract anyways and you could either replace it with a new NFT with traits or just change the pic connected to the token). Obviously only with a certain %, not all NFTs should evolve all the time.
