The question here is whether EIP1559 will be launched on mainnet before August 5th 12:00am ET. Currently the \u201cyes\u201d is very cheap to buy because majority thinks it won\u2019t arrive before the specified date/time.\n\nSo let\u2019s look whether this is a justified opinion or no. We could look at different sites to figure out the possibility of EIP1559 launching before the specified date. Basically evaluate  whether the \u201cyes\u201d bet is worth buying with the potential of earning more than 1000% if it happens (based on current odds). \n\nWhat we need to know is: 1) the block that EIP1559 would go live (that is agreed to be 12,965,000) 2) the current block number and time it takes for each block, which varies in each block, to calculate when the approx date it will go live.  \n\nEtherscan publishes each block that is mined and a daily average of the block time [here](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime). Another site that closely follows etherscan is [ethstats](https://ethstats.net/). It gives you current block number and live average block time. \n\nBased on what I see, the past few days the block time has been about 13.4-13.5 sec which is a bit above historical average and brings the update later than Aug 5th/12am ET. However, the trend is downwards and historical average is more on the 13.3sec or lower which would mean that the odds of the update launching before the prediction market deadline are good (and definitely not 5%). You can run your calculations using the block number/time and [this site](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadd.html) to figure out possible launch dates \n\nAnother site to follow the launch is [here](https://www.nicehash.com/countdown/eth-forking-2021-08-04-15-00) which somehow disagrees with etherscan and ethstats and gives a launch date/time on Aug 5th. Mostly because the reported block time is higher than what you see on etherscan. Nonetheless the trend is also downwards on this site as well. \n\nThis is not a financial advice; do your own calculations to check the likeliness of this event; I may be missing something here so please post feedback if your numbers suggest otherwise\n\nTLDR: the odds of having EIP1559 before the prediction deadline are higher than the current estimate (5%).

Don&#39;t change your strategy just because someone out there just made 100x on some token you only just heard of. Chances are, by the time you&#39;ve decided to get involved with said token, they&#39;ve already begun dumping on you and you won&#39;t realize any of the 100x gains you witnessed with others. You can pay attention to what&#39;s going on in this space without having to get involved with every new craze that shows up. If ETH is your largest holding and you have no Defi Tokens, don&#39;t even fret, ETH&#39;s time will come. Good luck out there.
