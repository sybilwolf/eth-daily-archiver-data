It's barely getting started. Can't wait to see it deployed to Immutable X and other zkRs in the future.\n\nThis is very much a self-indulgent ramble, but I have a fun story to tell from my altcoining days. I knew NFTs were going to be big, but we were missing an exchange like Steam had built. After some research, in 2017, I found this project that was building a decentralized NFT exchange protocol. In a sea of worthless ICO gambles, I immediately got interested, and over a few weeks I bought nearly 10% of the entire market cap of its governance token. In early 2018, I sold most of it at obscene profits, but kept holding on to some.\n\nIn mid-2018, this project launched their NFT exchange as an open standard. A few weeks, a new frontend adopted it, called OpenSea. Adoption was very mild for months and years as it was the peak of the bear market. The anon team that developed the exchange protocol gave up and disappeared, and the governance token became worthless. This is still the case.\n\nDon't believe me? See the address of what's currently tagged as \"OpenSea\", who created it and read the contract that was deployed: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x7be8076f4ea4a4ad08075c2508e481d6c946d12b](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7be8076f4ea4a4ad08075c2508e481d6c946d12b).

I knew NFTs were going to be big, but we were missing an exchange like Steam had built. After some research, in 2017, I found this project that was building a decentralized NFT exchange protocol. In a sea of worthless ICO gambles, I immediately got interested, and over a few weeks I bought nearly 10% of the entire market cap of its governance token. In early 2018, I sold most of it at obscene profits, but kept holding on to some.</p>\n\n<p>In mid-2018, this project launched their NFT exchange as an open standard. A few weeks, a new frontend adopted it, called OpenSea. Adoption was very mild for months and years as it was the peak of the bear market. The anon team that developed the exchange protocol gave up and disappeared, and the governance token became worthless. This is still the case.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t believe me?

To start with last year their AMM missed out on the Defi summer action of last year (in volume not KNC price) because adding pools required whitelisting by Kyber and depositing didn\u2019t provide an LP that could be staked so you couldn\u2019t farm with it using the standard patterns of that era.\n\nFollowing that, their contracts were simply more gas intensive than Uniswap and Sushiswap in an environment where 100 gwei was the norm for months. They didn\u2019t offer incentives for liquidity like Sushi was made for, they didn\u2019t have the highest volume per liquidity like Uniswap, they actually had less fees per volume than Uniswap, and they didn\u2019t offer the IL insurance of Bancor. They had nothing to distinguish themselves from their peers except for a staking/governance system with kickbacks and then they abandoned that too for now. While clones of Uniswap were popping up all over the place Kyber failed to react to the L2 market entirely until just this month.\n\nSo what have they been doing? They made a \u201cDMM\u201d instead of an AMM which is jumping on the capital efficiency bandwagon with Uniswap v3 but without as much flexibility. Each pool has an amp factor which is like a liquidity compression ratio for the pool. In the famous Uniswap bonding curve k=x*y. Half of x is available for sale every time the price of x halves. Instead of half, using their amp factor they can make 90% or 99% of the remaining liquidity available every time the price halves.\n\nThe other promoted feature of their DMM is a dynamic fee based on the short term slippage of the pool. The more the price moves, the larger the fee becomes. The theory being this gives the liquidity providers more of the profit and arbitrageurs less profit. That\u2019s all fine and good but in both cases they have yet to quantify the impact of these features, especially compared to their peers. Bancor for example, insures 100% against IL, even if they have to mint BNT as a last resort to do so. So how much IL does their dynamic fee cut down? They just provide no answer at all, even backtested. How efficient is their amp for price efficiency compared to Uniswap v3. No answer either. Troubling\u2026\n\nNext let\u2019s get to the token itself. They underwent a token migration specifically for the purpose of diluting KNC with an LM program that is distributing 15.12M KNC over 3 months on a token with a circulating supply of about 100M. In total they want to mint and distribute 42M KNC as part of their Kyber Ecosystem Growth Fund. Clearly that\u2019s going to have some downward pressure as that gets farmed and sold. This has given them $249M in liquidity from the locusts in the short term. But to do what? Their new DMM still isn\u2019t as capital efficient as Uniswap, still isn\u2019t as gas efficient, doesn\u2019t have the volume/fees per liquidity of Uniswap, etc. Once the program ends and locusts leave are they going to have built tighter integrations with the dex aggregators, pooled farming services, leveraged farming services, etc? How much of that liquidity is going to stick?\n\nThe old AMM is basically dead. Spreadsheet of data on my website. The volume in the last quarter has fallen to an average of 6.36M. In the last 30 days it\u2019s even worse, 2.54M. Even if it wasn\u2019t though, they have paused their burn and staking rewards for voting, so the PE would be entirely speculative at this point anyway. Using approximate last known parameters:\n\nNetwork fee: 0.1%, Burn: 6%, Staking Reward: 70%\n\nLet\u2019s take that last 30 day volume and project out a year to 927M. 0.1% network fee gives you .927M total fee to spread around. Benefit to KNC stakers on the old AMM with old rewards would be:\n\n.927 (total fee) * 0.76 (stake + burn rate) = .704M\n\nYou can adjust this slightly to account for the fact that not everyone stakes if you wish, it\u2019s still not competitive.\n\nMarket Cap: $129,987,866\n\nPE From AMM: 184.6\n\nHowever, as I said, these fees are speculative and based on a system that has been discontinued. The actual revenue is 0.\n\nNext let\u2019s have a look at the data from their new DMM. Surely that will be their saving grace!\n\nThey have about 250M in liquidity which is generating about $25k fees a day. All of that currently goes to the LP\u2019s but let\u2019s say they do the sushi thing and skim 1/6 of this for the network fee. That gives them maximum rewards to KNC holders of $4k a day. They are paying 15M KNC for this liquidity over 3 months. That\u2019s a present cost of $18.75M or about $200k a day to bring in that $4k a day of fees. Fucking yikes.\n\nIf we sum the AMM and DMM speculative fee on volume together that gets us a net profit of like 2.3M. Subtract debasement and the system is in debt by about 16.45M a year.\n\nIn summary, they couldn\u2019t pay me 100% APR to hold KNC right now.\n\nSelf promoting link: https://tokenomicsexplained.com/knc/","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I posted late last night on my KNC update but it occurs to me that my website isn&#39;t exactly mobile friendly, and the pages don&#39;t allow commenting so I&#39;m reposting here in case anyone wants to discuss.</p>\n\n<p>Kyber has had an extremely disappointing year.
