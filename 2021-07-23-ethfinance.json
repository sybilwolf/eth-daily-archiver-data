I [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/myq125/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2021/gvyspq1/) recommended you stay far away. The ETH ratio has fallen since then but not dramatically more than the rest of the market. So, let's review how their adoption has gone, their current 12 month revenue projection, and inflation schedule to figure out if anything has changed.\n\nTo review, there are 3 basic sources of revenue for their platform.\n\n1) [Origination fees](https://governance.aave.com/t/initial-discussion-2-origination-fees/654). So small as to be negligible, totaling to thousands per year at most.\n\n2) [Flash loans](https://docs.aave.com/faq/)\n\n>From Flash Loans, a 0.09% is collected from the loan amount, from which 70% is redirected as extra income for depositors of the protocol and 30% is split using the same 20%/80% model of the origination fee.\"\n\nThere's some easy data available from Aavewatch. There was generally a good change in behavior due to their LM program so I'll be taking from April 26'th to present.\n\nTotal from 4/26-7/22: $300,293\n\nProjected 12 month revenue: **1.26M**\n\n3) [Protocol Reserve Factor](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters). Basically it's the protocol fee for interest paid by borrowers. Again, projecting from my 4/26 data to present (87 days).\n\nTotal from 4/26-7/22: $5,445,318\n\nProjected 12 month revenue: **22.85M**\n\nTaken together this gives us protocol revenue of **24.11M.**\n\nThat is a significant improvement from prior to their LM program where the projection was 2.632M\n\nMarket cap: 3.724B\n\n**PE before debasement: 154.51**\n\nAaveWatch appears to be missing data for the Polygon market. For reference, at the time of this writing AAVE v2 has a market size of 14.598B and AAVE Polygon market has a size of 3.444B. Practically you can adjust the protocol revenue proportionally or ignore historical data and calculate the protocol fee based on the borrow amount, borrow APR, and protocol reserve factor for each asset and sum it. Either way, while this does affect the number slightly, it's not going to affect my conclusions so I'm not putting in the extra work for now.\n\nAll the fees above end up in a treasury address managed by the DAO. Long term they need use these funds to pay developers and incentivize the AAVE stakers in the insurance pool. With PE 150, if the development costs were 0 and inflation was zero the maximum they could pay all stakers is .66% of circulating supply. The actual yield for stakers would be adjusted proportionally to staking percentage; less staked is higher yield for those who do stake. The higher the reward for staking, the more AAVE this will attract and the more backstopped the protocol becomes against hacks, black swan events, etc. For me to be interested, I'd be looking for that number to be about 5% if the only source of inflation remaining was going to stakers. It's closer to 2% and that condition isn't true.\n\nNow, obviously .66% isn't going to attract much demand for AAVE, so to attract the remainder they add inflation rewards. Currently this is 1100 AAVE per day according to their site or about 3.13% inflation per year long term (once they exhaust their warchest reserves). @283.54 that's a cost of $312k per day, $114M per year. If you aren't a staker this is a pure debasement cost. If you are I would count that as revenue in the PE calculation for your class. Regardless, at current revenue levels they need to find people willing to buy or farm and hold something on the order of $80M+ per year to pay for this level of security. \n\nIn the short term, the story is much worse because of their LM program. That LM program that has attracted a significant amount of liquidity, about $7.8B though much of that was recursive (depositing one stablecoin to borrow another). I dare say they would call it a success, so much so they are extending it. So what is the cost per day of that liquidity? Well, they are paying 2200 AAVE per day. Again @283.54, that's about 34 dollars deposited per dollar spent in inflation per year. It's actually pretty effective in terms of LM results. Despite that, it adds about $228M of debasement cost per year. Compare this to revenue and the protocol is in debt.\n\nThis just means they are burning runway for now to pay for marketing and future growth. I would argue this is strategic spending and it has been effective. However, that doesn't make me want to hold their token while I get dumped on by the liquidity locusts. They can succeed at what they're doing as long as they continue to grow their way out of the debt they are incurring. However, a few points. Growth has largely stalled, the LM program is going away eventually and the liquidity locusts with it, and you can also find assets that aren't running in debt but are still demonstrating exponential YoY growth as well.\n\nSelf promoting link: https://tokenomicsexplained.com/aave/","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So how&#39;s Aave been doing since the launch of their LM program? I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/myq125/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2021/gvyspq1/\">previously</a> recommended you stay far away. The ETH ratio has fallen since then but not dramatically more than the rest of the market. So, let&#39;s review how their adoption has gone, their current 12 month revenue projection, and inflation schedule to figure out if anything has changed.</p>\n\n<p>To review, there are 3 basic sources of revenue for their platform.</p>\n\n<p>1) <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/initial-discussion-2-origination-fees/654\">Origination fees</a>. So small as to be negligible, totaling to thousands per year at most.</p>\n\n<p>2) <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/faq/\">Flash loans</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>From Flash Loans, a 0.09% is collected from the loan amount, from which 70% is redirected as extra income for depositors of the protocol and 30% is split using the same 20%/80% model of the origination fee.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s some easy data available from Aavewatch. There was generally a good change in behavior due to their LM program so I&#39;ll be taking from April 26&#39;th to present.</p>\n\n<p>Total from 4/26-7/22: $300,293</p>\n\n<p>Projected 12 month revenue: <strong>1.26M</strong></p>\n\n<p>3) <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters\">Protocol Reserve Factor</a>. Basically it&#39;s the protocol fee for interest paid by borrowers. Again, projecting from my 4/26 data to present (87 days).</p>\n\n<p>Total from 4/26-7/22: $5,445,318</p>\n\n<p>Projected 12 month revenue: <strong>22.85M</strong></p>\n\n<p>Taken together this gives us protocol revenue of <strong>24.11M.</strong></p>\n\n<p>That is a significant improvement from prior to their LM program where the projection was 2.632M</p>\n\n<p>Market cap: 3.724B</p>\n\n<p><strong>PE before debasement: 154.51</strong></p>\n\n<p>AaveWatch appears to be missing data for the Polygon market. For reference, at the time of this writing AAVE v2 has a market size of 14.598B and AAVE Polygon market has a size of 3.444B. Practically you can adjust the protocol revenue proportionally or ignore historical data and calculate the protocol fee based on the borrow amount, borrow APR, and protocol reserve factor for each asset and sum it. Either way, while this does affect the number slightly, it&#39;s not going to affect my conclusions so I&#39;m not putting in the extra work for now.</p>\n\n<p>All the fees above end up in a treasury address managed by the DAO. Long term they need use these funds to pay developers and incentivize the AAVE stakers in the insurance pool. With PE 150, if the development costs were 0 and inflation was zero the maximum they could pay all stakers is .66% of circulating supply. The actual yield for stakers would be adjusted proportionally to staking percentage; less staked is higher yield for those who do stake.
