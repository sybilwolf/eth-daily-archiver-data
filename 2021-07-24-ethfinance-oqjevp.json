I'm typing from an island (not a private one yet sadly).\n\nStrong price action on weak volume, if that makes sense. The ratio move was good. ETH led the way for BTC to break through the 50 Week SMA at 32.3k, downtrend line at 33k, AND set a new RSI higher high (for those who were following last we spoke). BTC will now be contending with the 50 Week EMA at 33.8k to see where it closes the week tomorrow night. The 50 Day at 34.3k is also a handsome target.\n\nBut again, all of this is on declining, small volume. Yesterday was 70% of the prior day which was already just 60% the day before. Weekly volume is 70% last week's going into the weekend which isn't known for adding much more. It doesn't mean it's not good; it just means it's tenuous and can be undone with the snap of a whale's.... finger? Bullish price action, extremely cautious technicals.\n\nMarkets:\n\nIn other markets, the story continues. Wall Street is telling two tales out of the same mouth.\n\nBullish?\n\n* Should be obvious. Big 3 indices all set ATHs with no clear end in sight until at least the S&P touches 4500. Tech stocks are soaring on good reports. \n\nBearish? Literally everything else, haha.\n\n* Covid surges, housing price surges, unemployment up, inflation screaming upward.\n* Bonds (TLT) went down but held support at the key level of 148. It means big boys are still taking money out of risk.\n* Dollar (DXY) closed the week above 92.90. Incredibly bullish (for it). More risk-off.\n* Financials (XLF) went down closing right at the 10 Day. Can be a leading indicator.\n* Small caps (IWM for convenience) went down closing right at or below the 10 Day. More risk-off.\n\nLook, you gotta follow the price action. Markets are demonstrably bullish and you shouldn't fight it. But the amount of caution I cast right now is at peak. These two stories being told -- recordbreaking equities AND market weakness/risk-off attitude -- THEY CANNOT BOTH BE TRUE. One will fail and you can bet Wall Street will always pick the winner.\n\nThis final week of July is -- big breath -- critical. It likely represents the last high we'll see in markets, both equity and crypto, for a few weeks. Quarterly earnings are coming in for the FAANG stocks, which tend to sell off on earnings. August and September are historically bad months. Post-Election August is the worst performing month for markets by a staggering margin throughout history.

I&#39;m typing from an island (not a private one yet sadly).</p>\n\n<p>Strong price action on weak volume, if that makes sense. The ratio move was good. ETH led the way for BTC to break through the 50 Week SMA at 32.3k, downtrend line at 33k, AND set a new RSI higher high (for those who were following last we spoke). BTC will now be contending with the 50 Week EMA at 33.8k to see where it closes the week tomorrow night. The 50 Day at 34.3k is also a handsome target.</p>\n\n<p>But again, all of this is on declining, small volume. Yesterday was 70% of the prior day which was already just 60% the day before. Weekly volume is 70% last week&#39;s going into the weekend which isn&#39;t known for adding much more. It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not good; it just means it&#39;s tenuous and can be undone with the snap of a whale&#39;s.... finger? Bullish price action, extremely cautious technicals.</p>\n\n<p>Markets:</p>\n\n<p>In other markets, the story continues. Wall Street is telling two tales out of the same mouth.</p>\n\n<p>Bullish?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Should be obvious. Big 3 indices all set ATHs with no clear end in sight until at least the S&amp;P touches 4500. Tech stocks are soaring on good reports. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bearish? Literally everything else, haha.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Covid surges, housing price surges, unemployment up, inflation screaming upward.</li>\n<li>Bonds (TLT) went down but held support at the key level of 148. It means big boys are still taking money out of risk.</li>\n<li>Dollar (DXY) closed the week above 92.90. Incredibly bullish (for it). More risk-off.</li>\n<li>Financials (XLF) went down closing right at the 10 Day. Can be a leading indicator.</li>\n<li>Small caps (IWM for convenience) went down closing right at or below the 10 Day. More risk-off.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Look, you gotta follow the price action. Markets are demonstrably bullish and you shouldn&#39;t fight it. But the amount of caution I cast right now is at peak. These two stories being told -- recordbreaking equities AND market weakness/risk-off attitude -- THEY CANNOT BOTH BE TRUE. One will fail and you can bet Wall Street will always pick the winner.</p>\n\n<p>This final week of July is -- big breath -- critical. It likely represents the last high we&#39;ll see in markets, both equity and crypto, for a few weeks. Quarterly earnings are coming in for the FAANG stocks, which tend to sell off on earnings.
