This covers things like room blocks, Luau's, etc. We get a group rate, we may get a bus to get to and from the event, and other perks like priority seating but the majority (if not all) of the expenses come from individuals not the hodlercon multi-sig. Events of this type manage their own billing system and gatekeepers. There is less we need to organize. If people have ideas of this type, we're happy to help coordinate many of these.\n\n2) Events for which the reservation is paid for by a single entity. This covers things like dining rooms at Duke's, firepits's at the Laylow, movie theater reservations, etc. While there may be individual drink tabs for example the majority of the expense comes from a single payer. At the very least a large up front deposit is required and commonly someone is financially on the hook for a food and drink minimum. To schedule events of this type we need a process to go from ideation to reality. I'm on the multi-sig so I'm purely considering this from the money management perspective. How do we go from \"how about we rent a boat with 30 capacity for a day\", figure out which 30 people, make the reservation and put down the deposit, and handle all the edge cases. A thorny question is who is going to be the de-anonymized individual to make a deposit (to be reimbursed) and be legally liable for the expense.\n\nWhile it hasn't been stated explicitly we've talked about this as though we're going to do a rollup of all events, figure out a single price to basically attend everything for the week, have people send that to the multi-sig, and then be good to go. There are some complications with that.\n\n1) Not all events will have the same capacity. We're expecting 100-200 attendees at this point. A room at duke's might have 30 capacity. A boat might have 50. Some events like renting a movie theater for a fireside chat with DC or someone might be scalable from 30 to 120 but we need to decide that number up front when we place the reservation and it's awkward to change. Building on this, there are probably going to be enough attendees that we end up with multiple events for dinner etc. I'm not putting my wife through coordinating 8 dinner events a night for like 10 nights. Maybe 1 night at the start. Self-organizing is simpler but I want to do what we can to ensure people that fly all the way out there don't feel excluded and have the network to self-organize with. My thought is to have us plan some of the larger events towards the start so people can network and that will help everyone find people they'd like to spend more time during their stay. I don't want to just give up on the ability to organize a dance party for JT to dj or for us to get a boat so 30 of us can all sing 'I'm on a boat' while spilling our Mai Tai's just because it's not a 200 person event at the hotel.\n\n2) Money is going to flow in gradually. Building on 1 above, the funds aren't going to appear all at once to book everything. Right now we have something like 50 people confirmed \"going\". Do we just decide on the biggest events right now, set a target donation at X/50 right now and hope literally all 50 pay up front? Do we set a target donation at X/100 right now and then have a plan to refund as we get fuller? Instead of refunding do we roll those funds into the next events? Consider if we only book as we confirm we have all the funds for the event. It takes 2 months for the money to roll in, we go to finally book and then the reservation is no longer available. Well shit. Conversely, we ask someone to put the deposit down and the funds just never appear. They're still liable for the full amount. Very different oh shit. A multi-sig cannot sign on the dotted line.\n\n3) Some of the largest capacity events are not as interesting. We can rent a hotel conference room for like $2500 a day. It has a capacity in the 100-200 range. Not much when divided out, and we have it for the whole day, but then what do we do with it for a whole day? We voted we aren't looking for a conference experience so what do we do with it? A talk around lunch, a talk around dinner, a meeting/coordinating spot in between? I'm just not sure that's the kind of thing the majority of people are into.\n\nSome things to pontificate before Tuesday.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I think we need to have a discussion about event planning for Hodlercon.</p>\n\n<p>There are two basic categories of events I&#39;d like to use to frame this discussion.</p>\n\n<p>1) Events for which the reservation is a block but which people can register and pay for individually.

Cut down 'core' events to bare bones and decentralize the event planning as much as possible with like a squad leader system or something, that will distribute the planning workload better and contain failure if there's some rugpully type action.\n\nIf I know people are interested in scuba diving for instance I might volunteer to coordinate that in advance of the hodlercon, create a room in the discord for it, advertise it, and work with scuba companies. I think for the break-out events we should take a hands-off approach and let each group figure out what works best for them if an advance deposit is needed. \n\nShould we consider employing some kind of refundable deposit/collateral built into hodlercon ticket? Good actors get theirs back but then if it comes out that you screwed somebody you'll lose yours, hopefully we can use it to repay whoever got shafted to some extent.\n\nBack to the 'core' events though, let's put an emphasis on scalability when picking those out. One idea would just be a beach BBQ, that's infinitely scalable with ease. It doesn't require a reservation, and we could buy all the necessary stuff less than 24 hours prior (anywhere to rent grills?).

The interface itself is very friendly, and has a ton of features that makes it easy to use lending and borrowing dapps in one place. </p>\n\n<p>For example you can utilize flash loans to repay your debt with part of your collateral, normally you\u2019d need to introduce new Dai into the loan under the normal MakerDao Oasis interface. Or you\u2019d have to manually withdraw some, sell on Uniswap, and repay (3-4 steps vs 1 step). </p>\n\n<p>For the auto saver part you asked about, it\u2019s just constantly adjusting between loan borrowing and repaying depending on price movement. When price rises you borrow more from the collateral and stack it back into itself, and when it\u2019s crashing you constantly sell to pay back collateral and safely exit the position.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-25 04:59:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h6gs7oh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_or5del","parent_id":"t1_h6goj96","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/CozImDirty","body":"It works as advertised but the volatility of Eth makes it hard to predict/plan out what you want it to do.
