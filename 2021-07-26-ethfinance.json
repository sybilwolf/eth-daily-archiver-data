Personally, I find the comments shared about ETH gaming quite interesting even though I have no interest in getting involved in it, so maybe some of you will get something out of the mistakes I made in this space even though you wouldn\u2019t touch NFT art with a 10-foot pole.\n\nOverall, I got very lucky with timing, I risked 5% of my portfolio and turned it into a little under 40% of my portfolio during a \u2018bear\u2019 market. I bought and sold about a dozen generative art NFTs and currently only hold a few ETH specific NFT such as the beacon book and EIP1559. These holds are more about sentimental value to me, I wouldn\u2019t flip them for a 10x.\n\n**Learnings and observations**\n\n* Most of my profit came from three re-sales, one being a Fidenza. I saw what the current big buyers were collecting (checked wallets to remove flippers from my analysis), what everyone was talking about on discords, and then momentum traded. I got lucky, one collection in particular went viral due to a Christie's listing.\n* I lacked conviction in my purchases and sold early, those three pieces are likely worth at least double today. It is very difficult to hold something you don\u2019t have conviction in through a period of low liquidity or exponential return. ETH can double in price and I don\u2019t stress, but if an NFT doubles all I can think about is getting out. Stress levels were much higher trading NFTs and this impacted my ability to make good decisions.\n* Another trap I fell into was low-liquidity. Some rare, low quantity NFTs also don\u2019t have a very active market. You might end up stuck in something that is a decent purchase but then see ETH prices increase and want to get out but have no buyers for another week.\n* I sold two pieces at a 50% loss that would likely have gone on to be profitable if I\u2019d held. The above point plus ETH price rebounding resulted in a panic sell. I lacked conviction that my investments would hold value against ETH price rises.\n* Quality over quantity was the way to go, there is a temptation to use a shotgun approach and buy a bunch of smaller NFTs.. but the big-ticket items are what the actual long-term holders in this space already want. If you are buying cheap things, you are trying to predict what will become popular to a group of people you don\u2019t really belong to, risky move.\n* The long-term collectors are the end customer. If it isn\u2019t something they want to collect, you are essentially hoping for another flipper to make the mistake of thinking it\u2019s something a collector will want. There are addresses spending 20+ eth a day on generative art that they never relist to sell, I looked at what they were buying.\n* Set collecting is a thing. I made some good return buying somewhat rare pieces that group together and then selling as a package. I could tell this by once again copying bigger collectors and seeing what they shared on discords.\n* \\* Split your purchases up over many addresses if you are looking to flip, stalking would be sellers and buyers is common practice through open-sea, but not a full on forensic deep-dive to see where your ether originated. If someone flags you as a flipper, they know that you will be more desperate to accept a low-ball offer and will be less inclined to buy off you or sell to you at a price you want.\n* Art platforms and open-sea charge a fee on top of sale, typically if you are selling for 10% on top of what you paid for you are making a loss after tax implications. There are other methods to trade NFTs that skirt these fees, personally I didn\u2019t use them because the artists deserve their cut.\n* Be mindful of converting ETH to wETH. I think it counts as a disposal in many tax jurisdictions. I believe I have made some very sizable tax events just by converting to and from wETH to make offers on open-sea. I have put aside \u00bc of my earnings in stable coins just to account for this and the short-term capital gains. It\u2019ll probably be even higher.\n* The biggest trap I found was what I call mint-FOMO. Most tourists, or newbies like the gambling aspect of new mints. They\u2019re willing to spend 3-5x the cost of the actual art in gas to roll the dice to see if they get a rare trait that they can sell for big bucks. Another bunch of them want to just immediately re-sell their mints for 0.1 extra ether. My learning was that currently the newly minting crowd is much larger than the resale, serious collector crowd. I saw 100\u2019s of cases of the original minters selling for a big loss within the week of minting and then a few weeks later the price of that NFT being worth more than the mint value.\n* I noticed collectors, and longer-hold flippers taking advantage of this observation. Essentially, they wait for about one week after a new mint and make low-ball offers on any addresses they can tell are flippers. The big give away is when someone repeatedly lowers the price on a new mint each day. You can tell they\u2019re about to capitulate and accept an offer at half what it\u2019s listed just to get rid of their bag.\n* Typically, the generative art that have appreciated in value are curated. The big curated sets have more appeal to the art collecting crowd who are not crypto natives.  I think the next important factor after visual appeal is the variance in results, if the algorithm spits out 1,000 copies of something that all look kind of the same it is unlikely to be much of a success. The way to tell in advance the variance in the mints is to look at the test net rinkeby results for that NFT, often you can see 100 or so test mints and get a good idea if it\u2019s going to be successful.\n* Something I found interesting is that I think some crypto holders use the high quality NFT art as a hedge against ETH price during a downturn. There was a lot of volume going into the market when ETH prices were falling. Because the market has a lot of non-crypto natives, while the exchange currency is ETH, many are valuing in fiat. So when you buy something for 1 ETH, if that art goes up in value and ETH crashes you can hypothetically sell for 2 ETH and increase your stack in a down-turn. I haven\u2019t been around the space long enough to know if the inverse is true.. I suspect it is.\n\nHope someone finds this useful, but keep in mind I\u2019m new to this market. Would you take advice from someone who\u2019d been in DEFI for 1-2 months about DEFI? Probably not, same thing applies here.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I want to share my experiences over the last two months \u2018investing\u2019 in the NFT generative art market.

That seems a bit weird to me, but I have no idea what a normal variation in used gas is for transfers.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: wording</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-26 05:15:42","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-07-26 10:07:40","id":"h6ku7mi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_orruz4","parent_id":"t3_orruz4","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Glittering-Duty-4069","body":"Comment Removed By Author\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Comment Removed By Author</p>\n\n<p><em>This post was mass deleted and anonymized with <a href=\"https://redact.dev\">Redact</a></em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-26 05:26:32","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-01-11 09:19:19","id":"h6kv8cs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_orruz4","parent_id":"t1_h6ku7mi","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Mathje","body":"Yes, but the issue is that the actual gas used by these transfers varies a lot, resulting in many failing transactions.\n\nSo my question is if it's normal that simple ERC20 transfers regularly use close to 2x or 3x the gas they usually use?\n\nEDIT: Also MM does not suggest a limit 3x the normal usage for these transactions (it suggests about 1.5x), and so they fail.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes, but the issue is that the actual gas used by these transfers varies a lot, resulting in many failing transactions.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is if it&#39;s normal that simple ERC20 transfers regularly use close to 2x or 3x the gas they usually use?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Also MM does not suggest a limit 3x the normal usage for these transactions (it suggests about 1.5x), and so they fail.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-26 10:05:14","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-07-26 10:10:45","id":"h6lu0eg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_orruz4","parent_id":"t1_h6kv8cs","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Glittering-Duty-4069","body":"Yes. \n\nThese and other issues are being addressed in a ethereum improvement proposal which has been approved and it's set to begin in two weeks.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes. </p>\n\n<p>These and other issues are being addressed in a ethereum improvement proposal which has been approved and it&#39;s set to begin in two weeks.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-26 11:29:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h6m5oj1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_orruz4","parent_id":"t1_h6lu0eg","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Mathje","body":"What EIP do you mean?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What EIP do you mean?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-26 11:33:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h6m6ca8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_orruz4","parent_id":"t1_h6m5oj1","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/hashtagfuzzmaster","body":"I'm gunna get a stoner cat.
