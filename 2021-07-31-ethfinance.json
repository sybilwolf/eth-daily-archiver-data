It's one of the most beautiful things about Defi. The first platforms to offer this were straight lending platforms like Compound. They established the pattern of overcollateralization, liquidation mechanisms, and variable rates based on pool utilization. However, who was borrowing, what were they borrowing, and why? Mostly people used the early lending platforms to retain price exposure to the base asset while borrowing to short something else. There isn't that much demand to short ETH and so there were far more lenders than borrowers leading to generally very low rates for lenders. I say ETH here but this applied to basically every token except stablecoins for which borrowing meant shorting the dollar and longing crypto. The crypto market participants are overwhelming (and unsurprisingly) long crypto. Go figure.\n\nThe next wave of iteration was with platforms like dydx which more directly supported longing/shorting in a single transaction and with leverage. The leverage part was based on the observation that if the lent funds could never leave the platform then the platform could ensure good behavior of the borrower. With Compound, if they didn't have overcollateralization you could just take the money, run away with it, and forfeit your collateral for profit. But if you were never given the loan and instead the platform managed the loaned funds for some purpose on your behalf then the platform could still ensure your good behavior. The adoption of these platforms directly took away borrowing demand from the base lending platforms, leading generally to even lower rates.

Prior Defi summer dex's just didn't have much volume or fees. But then Liquidity Mining was invented, first gradually by SNX, then more aggressively by COMP, and finally in a tsunami by YFI. The magic of Uniswap v2 that I don't even think they anticipated the significance of was that it gave a bearer asset to the depositor we now call an LP (Liquidity Provider) token. Using that, every food token in that day and age allowed you to stake your LP and get paid monstrous APR to provide liquidity to bootstrap the value of their newest edible. Once volume picked up, so did fees, and so there became a path to earn revenue using any tradable asset (on any Dex but especially Uniswap). In a matter of months volumes on all pairs, not even just for new Defi protocols, exploded and so a new pathway for yield was born.\n\nThe downside of course became known as Impermanent Loss. If you had MKR and you wanted to keep your MKR while getting some reasonable yield there was no way to do so. When you joined a pool, your MKR was inherently at risk. You were basically betting on a high volume crab market to increase your position faster than price movement eroded it. People observed the need from LP's to get some yield while guaranteeing their base asset and thought up two competing approaches to solve this need.\n\nThe first to arrive was essentially insurance. Bancor created a one-sided liquidity pool with their v2 launch. You could deposit there and split your trading fees with the platform. In the event the price of your asset rose, the system would first settle this guarantee using its profit, and then once that pool of money is exhausted BNT holders became the lender of last resort. Overall, the system works. Since inception the platform is deeply in profit in terms of its rake compared to the IL it is at risk for. Therefore depositors can rest safe in the knowledge that they can still have their MKR while earning some small percent yield on it. The downside of course is every cent you take from LP's that you didn't need to creates a market opportunity for your competitors. The other downside is, they simply don't have the volume of Uniswap or Sushiswap and therefore they don't have the fees.
