Personally I see that it is pretty much unavoidable because it is part of the space. On the other hand I can definitely see a fine line approaching where people are just pasting their assets and really have no involvement in the subreddit otherwise and then it becomes a game theory problem.\n\nPart two of this becomes this idea that fractionalizing the daily discussion ends up actually seeing an alternate thread becoming a ghost town. We seen it before with altcoin discussion threads and the monthly developer thread we once had.\n\nMonthly developer thread was cool because all kinds of projects could put a business card in the monthly. And then do it every month.. But they couldn't sit there and spam their project over and over.... every project got one comment per month. Nft thread might have to be the same kind of thing. Where content creators can put their personal comment with their personal assets in the thread one time per month but they can update their own comment as many times as they want.\n\n\nI have no final say in the matter.

I also use a hardware wallet, which MetaMask is synced to. This is nice for additional security, but not necessary.\n\n2) Checkout Zapper.fi \nThink of this as a Defi portal/dashboard. It provides access to tons of protocols allowing you to swap, farm, etc. as well as view your entire portfolio.\n\n3) Get familiar with Etherscan.io\nThis is a block explorer. View detailed information about you wallet including various tokens, transaction history and a ton more\n\n4) Learn primary functions of protocols/ DEX's\nBorrowing/Lending - AAVE, Compound, Maker\nLiquidity Providing - Uniswap, Curve, Balancer\nYield Aggregator - Yearn\n\nYearn makes it very easy to get started. They do a lot of the work in the background for you and allow you to deposit all kinds of tokens.\n\nCheck out some of the vaults here: https://yearn.fi/\n\ncrvSTETH is the first vault I started with. Long story short, you are effectively staking ETH in a completely liquid manner by giving up a little bit of APR.\n\nAlso, some people advocate borrowing against your ETH as collateral and using that for DeFi. Some consider this a way to \"protect\" your stack against potential contract risk.

I also use a hardware wallet, which MetaMask is synced to. This is nice for additional security, but not necessary.</p>\n\n<p>2) Checkout Zapper.fi \nThink of this as a Defi portal/dashboard. It provides access to tons of protocols allowing you to swap, farm, etc. as well as view your entire portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>3) Get familiar with Etherscan.io\nThis is a block explorer. View detailed information about you wallet including various tokens, transaction history and a ton more</p>\n\n<p>4) Learn primary functions of protocols/ DEX&#39;s\nBorrowing/Lending - AAVE, Compound, Maker\nLiquidity Providing - Uniswap, Curve, Balancer\nYield Aggregator - Yearn</p>\n\n<p>Yearn makes it very easy to get started. They do a lot of the work in the background for you and allow you to deposit all kinds of tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Check out some of the vaults here: <a href=\"https://yearn.fi/\">https://yearn.fi/</a></p>\n\n<p>crvSTETH is the first vault I started with.
