It does this in the way Ethereum does best, with alignment of incentives for all participants (except for miners lol, but they'll be out of the picture soon enough.) The \"ultra sound money\" meme in the Eth community really shows that we all *get it*. This is good for all of us. The community (and especially a few EthFinanciers) pushed for its adoption, and it sailed through with a groundswell of support, and the skilled work of the core and client devs. I couldn't be prouder for this moment.\n\nOne thought regarding prices though lol - any price action we see now or in the next few days will be purely market noise and speculation, not a fundamental effect of the update. Really could go any direction, and I'm not worried regardless. The underlying impact (a ~25% decrease in net issuance, with current gas prices anyway) will be spread out over several months. Think about why this is - miners sell their mined Eth at random intervals to pay for electricity and hardware. Some probably sell daily or weekly, while others probably hoard it up for months or even years before selling. So for any given bit of Eth earned by a miner, there's somewhat of a bell curve for the time between when it was mined and when it is sold on the market (and creating a downward pressure on price). That bell curve has a very long tail. So the impact on prices stemming from the decrease in miner rewards from 1559 will stretch out over many months, and thus will *not* manifest as any kind of sudden supply shock, but rather a gradual tapering down of selling pressure.\n\nNow, one VERY interesting observation stemming from this is that the Merge will change EVERYTHING with that bell curve. The day mining ends, miners will no longer form a random distribution of sellout times. Once they can no longer mine, any miner who was simply a mercenary and selling everything they mined will likely sell *immediately*. This will probably manifest as a rather large sudden, but very brief, *downward* pressure on prices just after the Merge. Of course, there will be some miners who choose to continue participating in the ecosystem, perhaps as stakers, and they will not sell, but many will sell immediately. Once they're gone, though... that six-month gap between the Merge and staking withdrawals is when I'm guessing we'll see some MAJOR price fireworks. When we're down to 1/10th the block rewards of currently, with EIP-1559 likely burning considerably more than that issuance, and the issuance still locked up on the consensus layer anyway, and network usage exploding between the ever-increasing dapp network and L2 rollups with their regular gas demand, and the positive narrative of PoS using 1/1000th the electricity of PoW... It's going to be spectacular, I believe.\n\nIn eight hours, that key little piece of the equation that will enable a deflationary economic policy will fall into place, and of all the humans on Earth who will benefit from it in the coming years and decades, those of us here are among the very few who can appreciate the importance of this moment.

Well maybe you aren&#39;t so bad.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously, imagine the stupidity/awesomeness of a world in which I can airdrop my new token only to people who bought the NFT of Project XYZ because I really believe in Project XYZ and I want to see them succeed.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I could also airdrop some tokens to holders of the NFT who weren&#39;t part of the original minting. After all they are part of the economic loop that feeds into the cause I want to support.</p>\n\n<p>I am actually more confident of this use case than of deeds/titles for real world assets. The reason is I realized that <strong>there&#39;s no using NFTs for real world assets without developing a way to attach ETH addresses to real-world identities</strong>. Or am I mistaken here? Is there some way of using cryptography where I can produce a QR code that when scanned verifies that I am holding the private key to the account containing a deed/title NFT, without revealing the account to the scanning party? Well, that would be awesome, I hope it&#39;s true.</p>\n\n<p>The other big use case for NFTs, in-game items/currencies/etc, I&#39;ve become a bit less enthusiastic about, because of the tendency for game designers to be unable to move beyond a design mindset that gravitates toward pay-to-win mechanics.</p>\n\n<p>I am still enthusiastic about other use cases: trading ownership of used games (or used software in general), trading in-game cosmetic items, and trading digital subscribtions to eg Netflix, AWS, etc.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-03 23:36:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h7ne9h8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oxlf7j","parent_id":"t3_oxlf7j","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethacct","body":"> Is there some way of using cryptography where I can produce a QR code that when scanned verifies that I am holding the private key to the account containing a deed/title NFT, without revealing the account to the scanning party? \n\nThis is, essentially, what zero-knowledge proofs are.

For ETH, anything under $10k is a reasonable (i.e. conservative) 5 year target in my opinion. Many in this sub forecast $20k or higher as you probably know.

I attempted to trade my way to more ETH, sometimes succeeding, more often failing. In winter 2017, despite realizing that I missed a big opportunity, I was still quite euphoric when ETH price was $1400. Then I watched it go down, down, down, until at $650 or so I figured this was a likely place for things to turn around. I used MakerDAO to take out a loan (collateralized debt position, aka CDP) using my ETH as collateral. With the loan I bought more ETH.\n\nOver the months that followed ETH went to $80.

By the time the depths of the bear had hit, I was depressed, feeling like an idiot. I still had that memory of feeling like a genius at the top of the bull run though.

In some ways it's been very negative for me, because I performed poorly at work and put my own plans for starting a business on hold so I could check prices.
