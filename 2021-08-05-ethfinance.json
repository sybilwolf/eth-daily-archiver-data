Happy fork day! And thank you for being here during our EIP-1559 countdown!\ud83d\udd25\n\n\u274c To commemorate this day I have prepared a (hopefully!) fun little game. After checking back with the community some days ago, I have decided to prepare a (hopefully!) fun little game to commemorate this event. I am converting the \u201cDo you realise\u2026 EIP-1559\u201d series into POAPs/NFTs and send them as a \u201cthank you for your support\u201d to members of this reddit community. This is a POAP-style \u201cI was there\u201d token, rather than something of great value.\n\n\u274c There are a total of 79 countdowns, starting on May, 19th and ending today, on August, 5th. I am converting the first 68 countdowns into unique NFTs and I would like to send these to members of the community who engaged in the countdown.\n\n\u274c The next 10 countdowns I am putting on sale on Opensea. Should there be anyone  silly enough to buy these commemorative tokens I am sending the proceeds to the developer and contributors to EIP-1559. Also, there is a 10% retention on resales of the NFTs and also those proceeds would go to the devs.\n\n\u274c Finally, todays countdown would be a POAP and everybody who wants one can contact me on Reddit and I am going to transfer him the token. After today, I would also sell those NFTs for a nominal fee of 100 USD on Opensea.\n\n\u274c So just to summarise: NFT 1 to 68 are unique and gifted to community members randomly chosen by me. NFT 69 to 78 are unique and would be sold to the highest bidder on Opensea. Today\u2019s NFT 79 has an unlimited supply and would be gifted to everybody who requests it within today and sold thereafter for 100 USD on Opensea.\n\n\u2b1c If you would like to receive NFT 79 please reach out to me within today!\n\n\u274c Please provide me with your Ethereum address so I can send this to you. To protect you anonymity please consider using a throwaway wallet that cannot be traced back to you.\n\n\u2b1c Just to clarify once more: I am doing this as a fun little commemorative game. I will not gain anything from this. I will not actively promote the sales of these NFTs on Reddit. I have reached out to the mods of r/ethfinance to ask for their permission. I do hope though that some NFTs get sold so that I can buy Tim Beiko and the crew a beer or two. I sincerely hope that everybody sees this just as a POAP token of personal value only and doesn\u2019t get upset if he has not been chosen to receive a unique NFT.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Friends!

A mere ten weeks earlier, on May 12, 2021, ETH set a new all-time high at $4,384.\n\nBetween the all-time high and this new local low, ETH holders experienced a rollercoaster ride that resulted in a maximum drop of **61%.**\n\nA frenzy ensued in the daily discussion thread on r/ethfinance. Over 1,000 comments poured in. A couple of notorious bears were getting upvoted as much as the bulls, sometimes even more so. Few people believed anyone. Few people trusted anyone. A mixture of fear and optimism was everywhere.\n\nSome of the ultra-bears were convinced a new yearslong bear market had officially kicked off (many of these folks have *already* deleted their comments).\n\nSome of the ultra-bulls reiterated the reasons why they bought ETH in the first place - the reasons why they had conviction in this ever-growing technological asset and why were willing to ride out yet another storm.\n\n*These are their words:*\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> So I'm assuming the bull denial is finally over. Are people finally realising this isn't a 'crab' either\n\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n> Everything is so fucked.\n\n> Not just crypto.\n\n> Were all so fucked.\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n>Wake me up when we're down 95% from the ATH ($219.22).\n\n&nbsp; \n\n> Woah, prices not seen since 3 weeks ago. Bearish TA people will no doubt think I\u2019m dumb, but I couldn\u2019t not buy a bit here\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> 1700 was bottom.\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n> Our 10k by EOY brothers still going strong here? \ud83d\ude01\n\n> I\u2019m lucky I don\u2019t have time to watch this bleed.\n\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> How do you bullish people still think the \"blow off top\" didn't happen? It went from 6k in March 2020 to 66k and is now \ud83d\udcc9!\n\n&nbsp; \n\n> Welcome to goblin town\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> I have a feeling we'll retest 1700 many many more times before we're out of the woods.\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> It took only 2 red candles for the market sentiments to change, and gradually the bulls were replaced by the bears. Those were the May 13 and the May 19 red candles. All happened within the span of 6 days. That was the beginning. \n\n> Conversely, sentiments can swing back to bullish just as unexpectedly. All we need are like 2 green massive dildos.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n> I was holding out hope that this was summer 2017 and not winter 2018. I\u2019m losing hope, and I think we\u2019re at winter \u201818 :(\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> Sentiment still doesn't sound like capitulation yet, or what do you guys think?\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n>...Capitulation is sort of a nebulous term, but I think it doesn't start to happen until $1,400 and .055 are broken. Triple digit ETH and sub $20k BTC would really do it IMO. We are getting close though - sentiment wise sub participation is down, retail seems to be out, and a lot of people have shifted bearish / stopped being uber bullish.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n> What if I told you this was the necessary process for us to flip bitcoin?\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> Ethfinanciers at $4360 : \"We've been pretty overheated for the past year and can expect a 50-70% pullback, standard procedure for a bullrun, happened to bitcoin in 2013 and Eth in 2017 ! \"\n\n> Ethfinanciers at $1700 : \"We're definitely in the early stages of a 3 year bear market and will be going sub $1000 imminently\"\n\n> I didn't sell nearly enough at the peak but I was never under any illusion that -60% was out of the question !\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> Didn't sell at 80 or 4k not selling here!\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> Not hating my 1750 buy yesterday rn\n\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> It\u2019s not gonna end is it\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n> You missed the ATH for now if you wanted to sell some. Move on and hold or buy now. Sure there may be a 50 50 shot ETH goes back to 1k or below. What if it doesn't? You should be in ETH for the upside.

A mere ten weeks earlier, on May 12, 2021, ETH set a new all-time high at $4,384.</p>\n\n<p>Between the all-time high and this new local low, ETH holders experienced a rollercoaster ride that resulted in a maximum drop of <strong>61%.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A frenzy ensued in the daily discussion thread on <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a>. Over 1,000 comments poured in. A couple of notorious bears were getting upvoted as much as the bulls, sometimes even more so. Few people believed anyone. Few people trusted anyone. A mixture of fear and optimism was everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the ultra-bears were convinced a new yearslong bear market had officially kicked off (many of these folks have <em>already</em> deleted their comments).</p>\n\n<p>Some of the ultra-bulls reiterated the reasons why they bought ETH in the first place - the reasons why they had conviction in this ever-growing technological asset and why were willing to ride out yet another storm.</p>\n\n<p><em>These are their words:</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So I&#39;m assuming the bull denial is finally over. Are people finally realising this isn&#39;t a &#39;crab&#39; either</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything is so fucked.</p>\n\n<p>Not just crypto.</p>\n\n<p>Were all so fucked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wake me up when we&#39;re down 95% from the ATH ($219.22).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Woah, prices not seen since 3 weeks ago. Bearish TA people will no doubt think I\u2019m dumb, but I couldn\u2019t not buy a bit here</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1700 was bottom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our 10k by EOY brothers still going strong here? \ud83d\ude01</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m lucky I don\u2019t have time to watch this bleed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How do you bullish people still think the &quot;blow off top&quot; didn&#39;t happen? It went from 6k in March 2020 to 66k and is now \ud83d\udcc9!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Welcome to goblin town</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have a feeling we&#39;ll retest 1700 many many more times before we&#39;re out of the woods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It took only 2 red candles for the market sentiments to change, and gradually the bulls were replaced by the bears. Those were the May 13 and the May 19 red candles. All happened within the span of 6 days. That was the beginning. </p>\n\n<p>Conversely, sentiments can swing back to bullish just as unexpectedly. All we need are like 2 green massive dildos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was holding out hope that this was summer 2017 and not winter 2018. I\u2019m losing hope, and I think we\u2019re at winter \u201818 :(</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sentiment still doesn&#39;t sound like capitulation yet, or what do you guys think?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...Capitulation is sort of a nebulous term, but I think it doesn&#39;t start to happen until $1,400 and .055 are broken. Triple digit ETH and sub $20k BTC would really do it IMO. We are getting close though - sentiment wise sub participation is down, retail seems to be out, and a lot of people have shifted bearish / stopped being uber bullish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What if I told you this was the necessary process for us to flip bitcoin?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ethfinanciers at $4360 : &quot;We&#39;ve been pretty overheated for the past year and can expect a 50-70% pullback, standard procedure for a bullrun, happened to bitcoin in 2013 and Eth in 2017 ! &quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ethfinanciers at $1700 : &quot;We&#39;re definitely in the early stages of a 3 year bear market and will be going sub $1000 imminently&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t sell nearly enough at the peak but I was never under any illusion that -60% was out of the question !</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Didn&#39;t sell at 80 or 4k not selling here!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not hating my 1750 buy yesterday rn</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s not gonna end is it</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You missed the ATH for now if you wanted to sell some. Move on and hold or buy now. Sure there may be a 50 50 shot ETH goes back to 1k or below. What if it doesn&#39;t? You should be in ETH for the upside. Trying to double your stack after an already 65% decline is pure gambling. Good luck to those who try it, but many will fail and be left with nothing but USD that you can&#39;t get a return on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you listen closely, you can hear the sound of a rhythmic beeping off in the distance.

The same 2 ETH mining block reward as before, plus a \"base fee\" calculated by the protocol based on average usage of the last few blocks (paid by users, not inflation), and a \"tip\" for the miners (paid the by the users). \n\nUnder the new system miners still get the 2 ETH block reward plus any tips paid by users, but they *don't* get the base fee - although users pay the base fee, it is burned.

Eth1 is what everyone is using at the moment. At the same time, we also have validators who are validating on Eth2 which is basically an experimental chain, they are also getting paid a reward, but it's way lower per block and are currently locked, and they do not get tips yet.  These chains are separate at the moment. In the next few months they will be joined together known as 'merge'. Eth1 and Eth2 both disappear, since they will become one, it's all just 'ETH' again, no distinction needed.  For ease you can think of Eth2 as the surviving chain . Miners also disappear.
