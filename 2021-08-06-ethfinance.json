We need to make ourselves so incredibly useful and innovative that existing companies would be leaving tons of money on the floor to ignore it, and we need to provide good tax and regulatory tools so that governments are equally brought in. In short, we need to *welcome* these legacy systems, not try to fight them and immediately replace them, because that will just get us driven underground where we can't get any real adoption.\n\nWe need crypto to become indispensable to the powers that be, in short. Once everything exists on top of decentralized systems, even if the things being created are themselves backdoored/centralized, then novel truly decentralized innovations will be on a level playing field with the centralized solutions. They can no longer just tar all of crypto with the same brush, because they have come to depend on it for their cash flows and tax collecting programs. In that moment, defi and other novel crypto innovations will be able to compete on a feature-by-feature basis with the old guard, and will likely win out. Or maybe the old guard pivots and starts developing their own true defi - that would be great too!\n\nBut all I know is, we need to work with regulators, and fight for adoption by big economic players like corporations, not try to exclude them and go it alone. Crypto is amazing because we do *have* that option to just ignore the regulations - they can't actually shut it down. But being ostracized by governments is as good as being shut down, when all we want is for crypto to be normalized and used in daily life. I don't *want* to be a shadowy super-hacker, I want to be a normal tax-paying citizen who's using crypto for its amazing innovations and disintermediation properties. If we don't play ball, we'll never see that.\n\nOnce we've reached a high level of integration with existing society, we'll be in a fantastic place to effectively push for some of the real freedoms and changes we all want. Remember, the boomers have only so many years left before we replace them.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Remember Microsoft&#39;s old approach of &quot;embrace, extend, extinguish&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>I know that was a terrifying slogan coming from a megacorp, but IMO this is what crypto needs to do regarding tradfi and overreaching governments. We need to make ourselves so incredibly useful and innovative that existing companies would be leaving tons of money on the floor to ignore it, and we need to provide good tax and regulatory tools so that governments are equally brought in. In short, we need to <em>welcome</em> these legacy systems, not try to fight them and immediately replace them, because that will just get us driven underground where we can&#39;t get any real adoption.</p>\n\n<p>We need crypto to become indispensable to the powers that be, in short. Once everything exists on top of decentralized systems, even if the things being created are themselves backdoored/centralized, then novel truly decentralized innovations will be on a level playing field with the centralized solutions. They can no longer just tar all of crypto with the same brush, because they have come to depend on it for their cash flows and tax collecting programs. In that moment, defi and other novel crypto innovations will be able to compete on a feature-by-feature basis with the old guard, and will likely win out. Or maybe the old guard pivots and starts developing their own true defi - that would be great too!</p>\n\n<p>But all I know is, we need to work with regulators, and fight for adoption by big economic players like corporations, not try to exclude them and go it alone. Crypto is amazing because we do <em>have</em> that option to just ignore the regulations - they can&#39;t actually shut it down. But being ostracized by governments is as good as being shut down, when all we want is for crypto to be normalized and used in daily life. I don&#39;t <em>want</em> to be a shadowy super-hacker, I want to be a normal tax-paying citizen who&#39;s using crypto for its amazing innovations and disintermediation properties.

But my point is that even if you present people with a system whereby this is possible, there will rarely be enough people engaged or educated enough to meaningfully participate (for a whole range of reasons). And that, in itself, is very risky and will lead to gaming of the system. E.g. you don't know that whole neighbourhoods haven't been scammed into (or willingly) selling their keys to crooks who seek influence or power (for some incentive). Moreover, most people don't have the time or inclination to follow policy change and vote like every week or every month. In the UK for example, turn out for local elections and policies (as opposed to national government elections) is usually pitifully low.
