Take the info here with a grain of salt because they have some of their R's and D's mixed up. \n\n**Live(ish) updates** (all times ET):\n\n**12:00pm ET - The Senate convenes for the day**\n\n**12:25pm** - Speeches start. No mention of crypto yet. \n\n**13:55** - Senator Rob Portman talking about who should issue 1099 forms for crypto trades. Says he's working with Wyden et al on compromises that will not ensnare regular users in needing to register as brokers and issue 1099 forms. \n\n**14:00** - Crypto talk done for now. Nothing of substance has happened so far.\n\n**17:15** - Apparently it's getting less and [less likely that there will be a vote on any amendments](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1424473298331738112) at all. As a reminder, the original bill's wording is pretty bad too.\n\n**19:20** - It's still up in the air whether or not we'll see any amendments to the bill, at least today. I guess they're making deals and compromises off the Senate floor right now, and occasionally dealing with unrelated business on the floor. Things are still ongoing for the day.\n\n**21:05** - The Senate is voting on the Senate's main amendment to the infrastructure bill as a whole without any additional amendments. I see a lot of people who think that the Senate is voting on the Warner-Portman-Sinema amendment (SA2627). I believe this is actually another amendment put forth by Sinema-Portman, which is just all the original changes the Senate made to the original bill from the House. This doesn't include either of the crypto-specific amendments. \n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the text in this is even worse for us than the Warner-Portman-Sinema amendment to the omnibus amendment, because there aren't even exceptions for miners.\n\n**21:10** - The bill passed with the original language. Neither the Wyden nor the Warner amendments were included.\n\n**Update** - This bill still needs to go back to the House to be approved with the amendments. There\u2019s still a chance that this could be fixed. We might need to start calling Representatives tomorrow.\n\n**Midnight** - Apparently there\u2019s still a chance to get this thing fixed in the Senate. [Some details on what\u2019s going on](https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1424556793506635776?s=20) from Senator Lummis (thanks u/pembull).\n\nMy take on this is that the Senate already agreed to pass along the bill as it is now, but there may be an option to allow 30 hours of debate, during which time amendments could be passed. It sounds like it\u2019s at least partly Schumer\u2019s call, but he doesn\u2019t want to do this because he thinks that Republicans will mostly use that time to complain about how much the entire infrastructure bill costs, when he would rather move on to work on other legislation. \n\nThe best option for us would be some sort of compromise where there\u2019s a limited amount of time allotted to pass amendments but not allow long speeches about the bill as a whole. I don\u2019t know if this is an option. If it\u2019s not, then pushing for the extra 30 hours would be best even if it\u2019s less palatable for Schumer. \n\nHopefully we\u2019ll know more in the morning so we can start lighting up the senators\u2019 phones again.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The crypto amendments to the infrastructure bill will likely be voted on today starting at <strong>noon ET</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Since it&#39;s a weekend, it might be too late for calls or emails to be answered/read beforehand.

Immediately leading with, \"if sound money is *asymptotal supply*, then ULTRASOUND money is *decreasing supply*!\" Wtf? No... That is so insane I cannot rightly comprehend it. Literally multiple fields of economic research study this question, and the answer is pretty well known but it is certainly not that. Long story short mv=pq and m growth is required commensurate with real economic growth constrained by velocity, assuming optimization. So not only is asymptotic M bad, but ethereum's non-asymptotic but infinitely disinflationary model is better. This would be a step back. And like I said it also makes zero fucking sense. Along with the equation of exchange, the solow growth model (well really its improved children) is the other most critical monetary policy tool. Rates need to be set optimally at r*, but the media (and institutional economists and politicians) de-logify the model into \"low rates = growth, tightening = lower growth.\" However, that is not true. If r* is 3%, and rates are at 1.25%, further moving rates to zero makes the problem worse, not better. This is a \"neofisherian\" state that creates debt deflation, which was famously researched by Irving fisher and somewhat hilariously Bernanke. https://scholar.harvard.edu/straub/publications/indebted-demand This is all to say that you cannot create value by artificially restricting or subsidizing nominal M out of a solow/exchange optimization. The very premise is nonsensical. \n2. 1559 doesn't make eth deflationary anyway, but does make it somewhat autoadjustive, which is fantastic. \n3. By the 3rd paragraph I would like to reiterate this person has a truly picassoan understanding of economics: \n\n>In a deflationary economy, currency increases in value in real terms, so individuals have a financial incentive to not spend money - they have an incentive to remove money from the economy, take less risk, and store their wealth for the future as it will have grow in value by simply doing nothing. This is great for the individual agent, who can put aside their hard earned cash at ease and expect to be able to pay their bills tomorrow. Unfortunately it\u2019s terrible for the economy at large, which sees vast sums leave circulation, reduced economic participation, and reduced investment in innovation.\n\nThat is so wrong i feel dumber having read it\n\n4. The rest just becomes philosophically indecipherable.\n\nThere are some good points in here like auto adjustments, but on the whole it reads more like an AI content generator (and I'd be willing to bet it was).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>TLDR: *you used the wrong formula and got the right answer?? *</p>\n\n<p>Sure that was overzealous.

That is so insane I cannot rightly comprehend it. Literally multiple fields of economic research study this question, and the answer is pretty well known but it is certainly not that. Long story short mv=pq and m growth is required commensurate with real economic growth constrained by velocity, assuming optimization. So not only is asymptotic M bad, but ethereum&#39;s non-asymptotic but infinitely disinflationary model is better. This would be a step back. And like I said it also makes zero fucking sense. Along with the equation of exchange, the solow growth model (well really its improved children) is the other most critical monetary policy tool. Rates need to be set optimally at r<em>, but the media (and institutional economists and politicians) de-logify the model into &quot;low rates = growth, tightening = lower growth.&quot; However, that is not true. If r</em> is 3%, and rates are at 1.25%, further moving rates to zero makes the problem worse, not better. This is a &quot;neofisherian&quot; state that creates debt deflation, which was famously researched by Irving fisher and somewhat hilariously Bernanke. <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/straub/publications/indebted-demand\">https://scholar.harvard.edu/straub/publications/indebted-demand</a> This is all to say that you cannot create value by artificially restricting or subsidizing nominal M out of a solow/exchange optimization. The very premise is nonsensical. </li>\n<li>1559 doesn&#39;t make eth deflationary anyway, but does make it somewhat autoadjustive, which is fantastic. </li>\n<li>By the 3rd paragraph I would like to reiterate this person has a truly picassoan understanding of economics: </li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a deflationary economy, currency increases in value in real terms, so individuals have a financial incentive to not spend money - they have an incentive to remove money from the economy, take less risk, and store their wealth for the future as it will have grow in value by simply doing nothing. This is great for the individual agent, who can put aside their hard earned cash at ease and expect to be able to pay their bills tomorrow. Unfortunately it\u2019s terrible for the economy at large, which sees vast sums leave circulation, reduced economic participation, and reduced investment in innovation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is so wrong i feel dumber having read it</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The rest just becomes philosophically indecipherable.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are some good points in here like auto adjustments, but on the whole it reads more like an AI content generator (and I&#39;d be willing to bet it was).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-08 08:03:55","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-08-08 09:15:55","id":"h86c4dr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p08jl0","parent_id":"t1_h85xjpl","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Rapante","body":"I just read it.
