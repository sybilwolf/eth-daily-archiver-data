A successful merge legitimises Ethereum, and takes a lot of perceived risk off the table, which I believe will be the final thing needed to unleash an absurd level of institutional investment into ETH and staking. I personally don&#39;t agree with people who think merge will be a &#39;sell the news event&#39;. It will do precisely the opposite imo. Any sell off will be minor, for the tax reason i mentioned, and gobbled up immediately by institutions.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-11 09:27:27","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-08-11 09:34:33","id":"h8ju41k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p26ba1","parent_id":"t1_h8jqn8k","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/etherenum","body":"Because some avatar on Twitter told me it was","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Because some avatar on Twitter told me it was</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-11 09:30:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h8juis5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p26ba1","parent_id":"t1_h8jpzwu","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"That would make my life too good so 150k is cosmically impossible unless I sell everything, and I\u2019m never selling everything.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That would make my life too good so 150k is cosmically impossible unless I sell everything, and I\u2019m never selling everything.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-11 09:34:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h8jv3a0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p26ba1","parent_id":"t1_h8jpzwu","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"That's only a small ratio gain to 0.15 if you believe bitcoin can hit 1 million a pop.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s only a small ratio gain to 0.15 if you believe bitcoin can hit 1 million a pop.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-11 09:04:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h8jqtgg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p26ba1","parent_id":"t1_h8jpzwu","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/etherenum","body":"That's not a very good way to sell it, because BTC at 1 million shouldn't happen in a rational market","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s not a very good way to sell it, because BTC at 1 million shouldn&#39;t happen in a rational market</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-11 09:28:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h8jua8g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p26ba1","parent_id":"t1_h8jqtgg","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"This market is anything but rational.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This market is anything but rational.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-11 09:34:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h8jv5fl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p26ba1","parent_id":"t1_h8jua8g","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/etherenum","body":"100% - but it should become more rational over time, and should do so before BTC gets to that milestone","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>100% - but it should become more rational over time, and should do so before BTC gets to that milestone</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-11 09:36:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h8jvcy7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p26ba1","parent_id":"t1_h8jv5fl","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Can you really tell me with a straight face that asset valuations on most things right now are rational?

Imagine that DAI is going above peg, say it's at $1.02.\n\nNormally, governance reduces the interest rate (stability fee) so that more people will be incentivized to lock up ETH and take out loans, flooding the market with more DAI and bringing the price down to peg.\n\nBut the problem is that even with completely free borrowing, a zero percent interest rate, there still weren't enough people willing to lock up ETH (or other trustless coins) and take out the free loans.
