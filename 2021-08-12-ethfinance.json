Dark energy doesn&#39;t exist, space is a finite membrane that folds around matter when created, stellar activity converts matter back energy liberating the spatial membrane to expand back to its native state. The acceleration of the expansion of the universe by was predicted by GUT-CP before being observed.

Do CoinTelegraph links trigger automod, and if so is there a list of banned news sites?)\n\nhttps://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/Grant-Thorton_circle_usdc_reserves_07162021.pdf\n\nUSDC is backed 61% by cash and cash equivalents (the gold standard), then 13% by Yankee CDs (foreign banks), which is okay I guess, and 12% by Treasuries, which is great (the US Gov't won't default on an obligation they can print money to satisfy).\n\nBut then you get to the last ~15%. USDC is backed 9% by unsecured Commercial Paper and 5% by unsecured Corporate Bonds. The Corporate Bonds have a minimum S&P rating of BBB+, which is admittedly a very good rating, but not foolproof (and the rating process itself isn't without flaw; Lehman Bros had an A rating and we all know how that turned out).\n\nEffectively, USDC is quietly becoming a bank, except without any FDIC insurance or other  safeguards.\n\nWith this very subtle shift in risk to the benefit of Circle's pocketbook and the detriment of USDC holders, without any USDC holders' consent, without publishing a press release, without sending out any emails or making any announcements, I am starting to understand why the government wants to regulate asset-backed stablecoins. It seems reckless to me for Circle not to even announce this change in a simple press release, or heck, in a tweet.\n\nIf you hold USDC, you have to realize that you don't hold 100% dollars, you effectively hold a conservative mutual fund of corporate bonds and commercial paper now. The difference is that if you were to hold this commercial paper in a brokerage account you would be earning a small amount of interest for the small risk you took on, but by holding USDC, you get exposed to the small risk while Circle keeps all the investment returns and pays you a 0% commission.\n\nI can't wait for better stablecoins like RAI and LUSD to get their 2-3 years of live testing behind them (DAI is unfortunately very flawed, as I've explained from time to time). In the meantime I still believe USDC's risk is very, very low, but with this change Circle has crossed a [schelling fence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kbm6QnJv9dgWsPHQP/schelling-fences-on-slippery-slopes) that I believe most crypto-natives would agree shouldn't have been crossed.\n\n**Change my view.**\n\n(P.S. This isn't going to keep me from using USDC because I believe it's still 99.99% safe, and still safer than all other stablecoins when you factor in smart contract risk. I'm just miffed that they seemingly pulled the cash backing quietly without announcing it, so that I'm not getting paid for the small additional risk I'm taking on as a USDC holder now.)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Anybody else a little ticked off that USDC isn&#39;t 100% backed by cash equivalents anymore, and that they made the change quietly without announcing it?</p>\n\n<p>(Edit: Removed link to article titled &quot;Coinbase removes \u2018backed by US dollars\u2019 claim for USDC stablecoin&quot;. Do CoinTelegraph links trigger automod, and if so is there a list of banned news sites?)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/Grant-Thorton_circle_usdc_reserves_07162021.pdf\">https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/Grant-Thorton_circle_usdc_reserves_07162021.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>USDC is backed 61% by cash and cash equivalents (the gold standard), then 13% by Yankee CDs (foreign banks), which is okay I guess, and 12% by Treasuries, which is great (the US Gov&#39;t won&#39;t default on an obligation they can print money to satisfy).</p>\n\n<p>But then you get to the last ~15%. USDC is backed 9% by unsecured Commercial Paper and 5% by unsecured Corporate Bonds. The Corporate Bonds have a minimum S&amp;P rating of BBB+, which is admittedly a very good rating, but not foolproof (and the rating process itself isn&#39;t without flaw; Lehman Bros had an A rating and we all know how that turned out).</p>\n\n<p>Effectively, USDC is quietly becoming a bank, except without any FDIC insurance or other  safeguards.</p>\n\n<p>With this very subtle shift in risk to the benefit of Circle&#39;s pocketbook and the detriment of USDC holders, without any USDC holders&#39; consent, without publishing a press release, without sending out any emails or making any announcements, I am starting to understand why the government wants to regulate asset-backed stablecoins. It seems reckless to me for Circle not to even announce this change in a simple press release, or heck, in a tweet.</p>\n\n<p>If you hold USDC, you have to realize that you don&#39;t hold 100% dollars, you effectively hold a conservative mutual fund of corporate bonds and commercial paper now. The difference is that if you were to hold this commercial paper in a brokerage account you would be earning a small amount of interest for the small risk you took on, but by holding USDC, you get exposed to the small risk while Circle keeps all the investment returns and pays you a 0% commission.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t wait for better stablecoins like RAI and LUSD to get their 2-3 years of live testing behind them (DAI is unfortunately very flawed, as I&#39;ve explained from time to time). In the meantime I still believe USDC&#39;s risk is very, very low, but with this change Circle has crossed a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kbm6QnJv9dgWsPHQP/schelling-fences-on-slippery-slopes\">schelling fence</a> that I believe most crypto-natives would agree shouldn&#39;t have been crossed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Change my view.</strong></p>\n\n<p>(P.S. This isn&#39;t going to keep me from using USDC because I believe it&#39;s still 99.99% safe, and still safer than all other stablecoins when you factor in smart contract risk.

Something like this with a zkVM with precompiles like StarkNet or zkSync 2.0 will be cheap enough. Cardano is probably 5 years away from figuring out a zkVM, though, given they have only just announced the discovery of zkPs as someone posted above...

I think this whole ETH vs Cardano thing really needs some context though and I really wish both communities would stop being at each other\u2019s necks. Ethereum community has an obligation to defend its position as the leader on DeFi and frankly being the only fucking project in the space to create anything useful and valuable - so simply because the Cardano community has seen fit to compete directly with Ethereum and essentially calls them out as the biggest bully on the DeFi playground right now, we see comments and posts saying as much. I think it\u2019s a bit more nuanced than that and you realize it when you actually interact with those people that are learning and building on Cardano. Those people aren\u2019t worried about ADAs market cap every five minutes and wondering if projects will deploy on Cardano from day 1 stealing liquidity from Ethereum or becoming more valuable.  They\u2019re getting ready to build their own separate defi ecosystem and are trying to do their best to hit the ground running.  I think Cardano is going to be an interesting independent ecosystem that will likely have multiple defi big wigs deploy on Cardano after the system proves itself as secure and then bridging/dev tools are to a point where interaction between the chains is feasible and worth their effort. But my main point is there\u2019s no point in comparing Cardano to Ethereum in terms of ethereums success because of Cardano is relatively successful, it\u2019s merits will vary greatly from the incredible success that Ethereum has experienced in the last 6 years.
