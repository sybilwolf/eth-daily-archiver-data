A lot of people lament that C/C++ won the language wars back in the 70s/early 80s. Lisp is clearly a more beautiful and elegant language and other functional languages like that would probably prevent a lot of bugs in code written today. But there's something about C-like languages that are sticky, despite their flaws. Perhaps they are easier to get going with, easier to just hack something together real quick. They are also easier to write compilers for, apparently, which is the thesis behind the famous essay, \"The Rise of Worse is Better\": [https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html](https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)\n\nThe EVM / Solidity is a perfect example of Worse Is Better. No, it's not the most functional or perfect language / vm setup you could imagine for smart contracts. But the Ethereum founders implemented it in roughly a year and shipped it. And since then, innovation in tooling, standards for abstractions like ERC20 and ERC721, and learning resources have improved so much that it's now easier to write smart contracts for EVM than anything else.\n\nRust or Haskell or some Lisp variant or whatever probably would have been a more ideal choice, but Solidity's similarity to JavaScript and high availability of libraries and open source code have made it easier to compile smart contracts for DeFi, DAO, and NFT projects than any other platform. And you get access to the network effects of the burgeoning ecosystem. Smart contracts have their own unique security risks and performance concerns (notably, gas constraints).

A lot of people lament that C/C++ won the language wars back in the 70s/early 80s. Lisp is clearly a more beautiful and elegant language and other functional languages like that would probably prevent a lot of bugs in code written today. But there&#39;s something about C-like languages that are sticky, despite their flaws. Perhaps they are easier to get going with, easier to just hack something together real quick. They are also easier to write compilers for, apparently, which is the thesis behind the famous essay, &quot;The Rise of Worse is Better&quot;: <a href=\"https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html\">https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The EVM / Solidity is a perfect example of Worse Is Better.

My point is, I don&#39;t really know how to explain to them that ADA is not a great investment beyond the &quot;bazaar vs cathedral&quot; argument.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose all crypto communities verge into this territory in some manner, but the even mannered, logic based ethos from the top of the ETH community is one of the reasons I found it so appealing in the first place. If we have an amazing product, we don&#39;t need to worry about the success of other projects. We can&#39;t say BTC people are shitting on ETH because their afraid then do the same to ADA but say all the shit posting is warranted.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-13 04:43:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h8rub8a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p3grli","parent_id":"t1_h8rmurk","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SwagtimusPrime","body":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lbh16s/daily_general_discussion_february_3_2021/glugrgz/?context=999\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lx4hv1/i_have_seen_a_substantial_amount_of/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ndgwea/daily_general_discussion_may_16_2021/gybnt9o/?context=999\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/p2t1uj/daily_general_discussion_august_12_2021/h8mfham/?context=999\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nqdun4/daily_general_discussion_june_2_2021/h0dpi73/?context=999\n\nyou're welcome","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lbh16s/daily_general_discussion_february_3_2021/glugrgz/?context=999\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lbh16s/daily_general_discussion_february_3_2021/glugrgz/?context=999</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lx4hv1/i_have_seen_a_substantial_amount_of/\">https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lx4hv1/i_have_seen_a_substantial_amount_of/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ndgwea/daily_general_discussion_may_16_2021/gybnt9o/?context=999\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ndgwea/daily_general_discussion_may_16_2021/gybnt9o/?context=999</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/p2t1uj/daily_general_discussion_august_12_2021/h8mfham/?context=999\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/p2t1uj/daily_general_discussion_august_12_2021/h8mfham/?context=999</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nqdun4/daily_general_discussion_june_2_2021/h0dpi73/?context=999\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nqdun4/daily_general_discussion_june_2_2021/h0dpi73/?context=999</a></p>\n\n<p>you&#39;re welcome</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-13 05:21:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h8ry6ch","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p3grli","parent_id":"t1_h8rub8a","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"Thanks for linking my comment.

This is stuff you're just hoping the law says. Unfortunately hope isn't a great winner of legal battles. \"Common enterprise\" is the closest I can find and ETH Foundation, ETH development team etc is certainly a common enterprise as far as I can tell, promoting the Ethereum platform.\n\nNeither does there have to be any instrument.
