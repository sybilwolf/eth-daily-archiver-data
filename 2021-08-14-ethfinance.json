Equities move too slow and it's causing me to get myopic on these daily swings. I actually lost money this week for the first time in ages so I'm a tad miffed.\n\nMarkets Recap:\n\n* BTC strong. Above the 50% fib line at 47k on above-average volume. The next test is the far more telling 61.8 fib line at 51k. It's gonna be a massive profit taking area and likely a huge fight. A failure or weakness anywhere up to 51k should have them retesting the 43-44k volume support area (called \"supply\" area often too).\n* ETH stronger. Holding just under the mega-test area of the ratio at 0.07, a line drawn during the 2018 bear market and one that served repeatedly as a battleground this past May. If a solid break doesn't happen before the September doldrums, it may not happen until this winter, but either way would send us toward .084.\n* Dollar (DXY) 92.52 - The dollar on Thursday night was threatening to set its first weekly higher high since basically the pandemic panic and put real pressure on assets. Then Friday it got nuked by traders even as the consumer sentiment reports read a little negative. After crashing down through the 10Day, it closes the week still quite above the 10Week at 92.17. Neutral bullish.\n* Indices clawing upward with weak new ATHs, but bullish all the same. More divergence than a Hunger Games ripoff, but that's not stopping traders from charging forward on easy monetary policy. With both the Nasdaq and Dow recovering strongly above psychological levels like 15k and 35.5 respectively, eyes will be on S&P (4467) as it tests the super scary 4500. Pundits seem to think 5000 is more likely before a correction. We watch with earnest. Strong stable equities make for strong, unstable (in a good way!) cryptos. Bullish cautious.\n* Small caps (IWM) 221.13 - the only real weiner of the bunch, but sometimes a bellwether for weakness in coming weeks and months. IWM closed a FIFTH straight week below the 10W after a nasty plunge and several rejections. Bears are licking their chops for a shot at 204 and below. Neutral bearish.\n* 10Y yield (1.298) - oh yieldy yieldy yield what's up with you? she made for a breakout above 1.35 and then shooting star'd back down through the 10Week. It's still a green shooting star close but a rejection is a rejection. Yields haven't been AT the 10W since May 24. Icky close. 50W support at 1.213. Neutral bearish.\n* Bonds - another weird indicator is that TLT and TLH finished the bullish week in stocks... also extremely bullish? TLT closed a massive lollipop (dragonfly doji) at 148.55, still below the 50W at 149.29 but also STRONGLY bouncing off the 20W support at 145. Similarly the TLH closed strong at 150.89 in a damn-near-dragonfly as well, halfway between 10W support and 50W resistance. I keep saying it and markets keep slapping me. Strong bonds and strong equities rarely coexist for long. So idk. Slightly bearish.\n* Lastly, VIX for volatility. with the weekly close at 15.46 we're now in the most boring market movements since October 2019. Some folks I follow think that if the 10W average (currently 16.91)  trends below 15, we could see a complete market volatility reset meaning years and years of more steady growth. Food for thought.\n\nEyes-on this week: US retail sales  - Tuesday 8:30am NYC and the Fed spouts some minutes on Wednesday at 2pm NYC. What if they say \"taperi--\"? Hahaha we know they won't. This train's on rockets fueled by bathtub DMT. \n\nCheers. Comments and criticism welcome regarding the format.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Might do these weekly for a bit.

It follows the number and rules of rarity of Cryptopunks and its just being released as we speak (released everyday and only about 3k of the total 10k punks have been released yet). Love the concept and love it as avatars for social media.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/kmndz\">KMNDZ</a> - artist that mixes nature themes with mechanical/artifical elements into colourful and very detailed NFTs. Love looking at his art and think it deserves more attention than some of the doodles I sometimes find being sold for 10 ETH on Opensea</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/soulcurryart\">SoulCurryArt</a> - love the abstract / cubist style with abundant usage of colour. Love the art but its already out of my budget range. So I follow it, watch it but got none of it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/psychologicalsymbolism\">Alex Lavrov Art</a> - personally I find the works beautiful to look at and the sort of stuff I would buy a digital frame to hang it on a wall (same applies to KMNZ and SoulCurryArt btw). Again, way beyond my wallets budget but can always admire it on Opensea I guess.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-14 13:05:06","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-08-14 13:17:05","id":"h8y6cn6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p41sp2","parent_id":"t1_h8y0y9w","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/hipaces","body":"I have to admit, Cardano has defied all my expectations.
