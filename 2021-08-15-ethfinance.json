While the first two stereotypes are most likely to get information from YouTube (nothing wrong with that), this guy is tuned into a lower level in some legitimate private groups and finds opportunities to invest in projects before they hit the hype cycle. These folks are plugged in and have the potential to do very well.</p>\n\n<p>Stereotype 4: &quot;Accumulators&quot; (I am this) Accumulators tend to identify a platform with potential and simply accumulate as much as they can before moving on to other things. They don&#39;t sell what they hold to buy new things, instead they just continue building their gallery of coins. Some will do well and some will fail but accumulators are pretty committed to the things they hold for the long term.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-15 04:49:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h90rqsq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p4nb3l","parent_id":"t3_p4nb3l","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Chromes","body":"I've noticed a trend among some of my friends who have asked me about ETH.

I&#39;ve mentioned it multiple times here already, but looking at the last 24h of gas usage on the main chain, NFT related txns already combined over 25% of total gas used: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/gasTracker\">https://etherscan.io/gasTracker</a> This just based on three contracts: OpenSea, Axie Infinity bridge, OpenSea: Registry. There just isn&#39;t too much room left to grow.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s still undecided on which rollup(s) the NFT community will regather, but <a href=\"https://www.immutable.com/\">Immutable X</a> is a strong candidate. It&#39;s a zk-rollup focused on NFTs. They already have Gods Unchained and Illuvium + some other smaller projects. They also have some future integration <a href=\"https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1377352145666641923\">partnership with OpenSea</a>. Which might be the deciding factor.
