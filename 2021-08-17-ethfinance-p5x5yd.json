I try to address each of your concerns that ETH supply may not decrease because of a) scalability, b) ETH price increases, and/or c) increased PoS issuance as more ETH is staked.\n\nI do want to highlight that having fee burn continuously greater than PoS issuance will never be a hard guarantee. There are definitely scenarios where Ethereum's utility suddenly collapses, e.g. a catastrophic consensus attack that causes a loss of user confidence. There are also scenarios where Ethereum's utility slowly dwindles over time, e.g. if the transactional utility moves to another superior blockchain.\n\nBecause you mentioned the word \"forever\" I do want to share a natural and simple model where the ETH supply does decrease forever. When venturing into timescales significantly longer than 10 years (e.g. 100 years or 1,000 years) it's critical to think of the fee burn as being sized relative to supply (i.e. not being a fixed amount like 1M ETH/year).\n\nIf we model the fee burn to be 2% of the annual supply and annual issuance to be 1,000,000 ETH/year (rounding up the planned 963K ETH/year PoS issuance cap) we would asymptotically deflate forever towards a 50M ETH supply (see [this graph](https://imgur.com/a/v8SpMfh)). This would be similar to Bitcoin's asymptotic supply but in the deflationary direction as opposed to the inflationary direction. (Technically Bitcoin issuance will eventually go to zero because of rounding errors. Similar rounding errors apply to ETH as well.)\n\n> If demand for transactions increases by 1,000x to match the 1,000x increase in scalability over the next couple of years.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to accurately predict how scalability will affect ETH-denominated fee volumes. Understanding the elasticity of transaction fees with increased blockspace supply, as well as induced demand, are hard topics. One thing we can easily do is look at the 6-year historical trend. If that historical trend is any indication, scalability *increases* ETH fee volumes.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum has scaled significantly during its 6-year lifespan. The gas limit has increased from ~3M gas/block to ~15M gas/block, i.e. a ~5x scalability. Also individual dApps have greatly improved gas efficiency which is effectively a scalability improvement. For example, Uniswap V3 has 3x more volume than Uniswap V2 (~$1.5B versus ~$0.5B daily volume) but Uniswap V3 has 2.5x smaller fee volume than Uniswap V2 (see burn leaderboard on [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money/)). So Uniswap V3 is effectively 7.5x more gas efficient than Uniswap V2. Finally, we have had dApp-specific rollups (and validiums) for many months now (e.g. dYdX, Loopring, ZKSwap, DeversiFi, Aztec, etc.\u2014see [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/)).\n\nYet despite all this gradual scaling the ETH-denominated fee volume has gone nothing but up. As a rough heuristic the ETH-denominated fee volume has grown 10x every 2 years. In 2017 it was ~10,000 ETH/year, in 2019 it was ~100,000 ETH/year and now in 2021 it's ~1,000,000 ETH/year.\n\nWhile Ethereum fee volumes can't grow exponentially forever I'm optimistic we can maintain current fee volumes (relative to supply) which are sufficient for long-term deflation. One reason is that right now Ethereum is catering for less than 1,000,000 users (mostly DeFi and NFTs). So from a raw user standpoint we have a 10,000x growth opportunity. We also have a per-user growth opportunity as interacting with dApps becomes more and more commonplace in our daily lives.\n\n> If the price of ETH remains constant.\n\nThis is something I addressed in the first ultra sound money Bankless episode (timestamped link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWqhn1hXvVc&t=8096s)). The 6 years of historical evidence suggest that the ETH-denominated fee volume (and hence total ETH-denominated fee burn) is positively correlated with ETH price. Some of the possible explanations I put forward in the video are:\n\n 1. High correlation between ETH price and user interest. When the price of ETH increases, Ethereum user interest increases, which leads to more Ethereum demand. The same argument applies to builders (see the \"legitimacy by performance\" path in [this image](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1400137477680209921/photo/1)).\n 2. High correlation between ETH price and economic bandwidth. When the price of ETH increases, economic bandwidth increases, so Ethereum utility increases, which increases Ethereum demand. A related point is that economic density (the amount of value carried by transactions) increases with ETH price.\n 3. The ETH userbase becomes richer which decreases price sensitivity to transaction fees.\n 4. ETH is increasingly the preferred unit to denominate activity on Ethereum (e.g. see Uniswap trading pairs, NFT market). This trends reduces the correlation between ETH-denominated fee volume and the ETH/USD price.\n\n> No further validators are added beyond the Merge.\n\nPoS issuance is so small that we can simply assume the most conservative scenario where PoS issuance is maxed out.\n\nNotice that in [the spreadsheet linked here](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1424039388548321283) I assume the worst case scenario for PoS issuance (namely 963K ETH/year) for both the \"best guess\" and \"lean conservative\" scenarios.

Some people are disappointed about it now, as they think a deflationary environment is unhealthy (I disagree, of course, and indeed, this comment was instigated by [a Glassnode analysts's comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/p5ts88/there_are_serious_concerns_about_the_longterm/)); while others may be disappointed and angry when we do indeed see positive inflation in short timeframes. I just want people to be aware that there are lots of moving parts. Also, I do believe that if deflation is high, we'll see a self-correcting mechanism lead to milder deflation/inflation over time, even if ceteris paribus. I think [Ethmodel.io](https://Ethmodel.io) highlights this very well!\n\nI'm also not worried about rollups, the adoption has been gradual, and both Optimism and Arbitrum have opted for an incremental approach. This will be very much like the gradual increase in scale Ethereum has seen over the years, as you have mentioned above. The data shards release scares me though, it's several years of scale added overnight, and I wrote about my concerns here:[https://ethresear.ch/t/gradual-sharding-rollout/10320/](https://ethresear.ch/t/gradual-sharding-rollout/10320/).\n\nFinally, it's clear that Ethereum is in an exponential growth phase, but we know that adoption will taper off eventually, like all new technologies. There's no doubt the transaction demand so far has outstripped ETH price increases, but I do think this is not sustainable. Of course, this could be years or decades away. I do have some evidence that this trend has started reversing since 2020 DeFi Summer, when we can all agree Ethereum usage came of age. See here: [https://imgur.com/a/kLKSmoj](https://imgur.com/a/kLKSmoj) (Data source: Etherscan). Looking at the 30-day moving average, you can see we've started making lower highs as the price is gradually increasing. I'd also point out that the bottom lulls are making lower lows. This despite an increase in demand over time. The June 2021 lull is roughly half that of December 2020. Indeed, in December 2020 we bottomed out at \\~10 gwei, while in June 2021 we saw gas prices as low as \\~5 gwei. I'm definitely not saying this is conclusive, I'm just saying that the explosive growth in transaction fees we have seen in the first 6 years may be flattening out, and 2020 DeFi Summer may just be the inflection point.\n\nThe validator increase should be a negligible factor, true. Can we assume that the active validator cap will be implemented at \\~1M validators?\n\nThanks for everything, once again.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you for the response, Justin.

All these assumptions are obviously speculation and made to explain my thoughts. If my assumptions are wrong, my answer is wrong (at least most likely), but I really believe what I will try to explain is one (of a few/ many) option for this cycle.\n\n**Scenario 1: \"History rhymes\"**\n\n\\- BTC tops at 100k\n\n\\- ETH will top at 20k --> we are doing another 6x from here (I think 30k is possible as well, that would mean another 9-10x from here)\n\n\\- Alts will perform on a similar scale and some will outperform both BTC and ETH --> alts will do 10x to 15x and some, even top 20/50 coins will do 20-25x from here.\n\n**Scenario 2: \"Merge leads to a blow off top never seen before\"**\n\n\\- BTC tops at 250k (s2f prediction)\n\n\\- ETH will top at 50k or even 100k (how? BTC peaks, there is some sideways action, ETH merge happens, supply side shock --> FOMO, ETH moons) --> we do another 20x from here\n\n\\- Alts will at least partially move with ETH --> \"all\" alts do at least another 25x from here\n\nI'll take scenario 1 for my explanation, but everything scenario 2 makes a correction even likelier and the explanation is in the end the same. There are scenarios somewhere in the middle (e.g. BTC tops at 250k and without the merge ETH goes to 50k, but that doesnt really change my point).\n\nIf scenario 1 plays out that means that ETH has a market cap of 2T-3T. Now we could argue that this is \"okay\" for the state of ETH and everything that is built on top, e.g. DeFi, NFTs, etc. But I think this is rather high and probably a \"high\" valuation. If we look at 100k ETH we would look at a 10T market cap. Thats close to Gold's market cap. ETH is cool, but thats most likely too much :)\n\nThe fun part is: I am not even worried too much about ETH (and somehow the same applies for BTC), I am worried about the crypto market as a whole and thus alts. Some examples:\n\n\\- If ADA goes 10x from here (scenario 1) it would have a price tag of 20 USD and a market cap of 650B. Without smart contracts/ just added smart contracts. Without usage. Without a real ecosystem.\n\n\\- BCH and LTC would both be 100B market caps. Maybe even ETC that was 51% attacked several times would be valued 100B.\n\n\\- UNI would be around 200B. Thats 4x Coinbase. Now dont get me wrong, I love UNI and it is the future. But its not even fully live on L2 yet. And there is (until now) no revenue for token holders.  And its not the only DEX out there = there is no monopoly.\n\nThese are just some examples. The summary is that the market would be too hot, too much speculation, purely FOMO driven. Doesnt matter if we take vaporware or real projects. If it played out like that the alt market would IMO really deserve a correction. I dont think I have to walk you through scenario 2 :D That would be a shitshow in terms of market cap/ individual price tags.\n\nBut lets be honest: even ETH would be overvalued because its still early, way to hard to understand for normies and also the narrative is not out there yet. \"digital gold\" is something people understand. Smart contracts, programmable money, tripple point asset, defi. Way too difficult still.\n\nOn top we just need to look at May. May was great, obviously there was some fud, but generally speaking the market wasnt crazy (at least not compared to the numbers from above). Still the market crashed hard. In 2017 there were several 33%+ corrections. In 2021 most corrections were around 25% max. I thought the market had matured. Oh boy, I was wrong. 60%. Why? It doesnt really matter. If we can go down 60% after a nice rallye we obviously can go down 75-80% after a blow off top and 90% after a crazy merge-induced FOMO taking us to levels we cant believe.\n\nSo 30k --> 3k is possible (actually very similar to BTC with its 20k --> 3k move 2017/2020), alts would be hit even harder. And if we hit 100k than 10k is obviously possible as well.\n\nAlways remember: in crypto the market peaks are higher than anyone expects them to be, but the lows are also worse than you imagine. As long as there is a 4 year cycle and the market is not mature/ valued based on fundamentals like usage, MAUs, revenues, etc. we can see corrections of 75%+","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Let me start with some assumptions before answering your question.
