Despite my negativity I still think play-to-earn is something to be excited about as a gamer and is a crucial requirement for the metaverse. \n\nPlay-to-earn will benefit the knowledgeable, and prey on the nieve. The paying group will not just be isolated to the pay-to-win time poor crowd, but also the group who cannot unravel the complex tokenomics and cost/benefits inside these games. It will be just as toxic in a way as the play-to-win models are currently on certain groups. \n\nSome of what I've seen reminds me of the old [razzle dazzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razzle_(game)) scam. The complexity of the scoring system obsfuscates the fact that it is unlikely that a player would ever win before running out of money, or that the value of the prizes won would ever equal the amount of money spent chasing them.\n\nI'll use Illuvium as an example since it's one i'm actually keen to play and IMO has a pretty fair system so far:\n\n* To earn you need to pay, you will need specific items that increase your potential to capture the higher ranking pokemon. Weapon and armor, shards to capture, travel costs, rocket boots to get to better locations. All with different rarities, use-cases and costs. You will need to buy these in ETH or craft. Players will be initially hesitant to sell collected pokemon because those pokemon could be used to collect higher tier pokemon so this is an additional cost or opportunity cost. \n* If you craft items you will need to buy multiple other items with ETH such as fuel which is created by land. \n* If you own a land to create the fuel it costs you an upfront ETH amount for the land then you need buildings on it to create the fuel which will cost other materials that you either need buildings for or buy with ETH. There are other revenue streams from this land you need to consider in your cost/benefit. There will be 20% of land issued in peak NFT mania, is this a good investment, should you buy land at release instead, how is the remaining 80% of land going impact the cost/benefit of your fuel production?\n* There is a token that can be used for many expenses in the game which you derive from staking the main token. Those expenses are in turn paid back to holders of the main token.  However if you use this token you are forfeiting the main token rewards that would compound and give more revenue share. These main tokens would be locked for one year, so try and weigh the current value of the expense reduction with the future value of the token in one year plus compounding and revenue distribution. Players should compare this approach with the other option of paying for everything in ETH, how many users are going to use the sub token thereby impacting value of that token, and in these years is the price of ETH going to be a better hold?\n* The main token has an insane three year issuance rate with high staking, but all claims for the in-game expense token are burnt from the main supply. There are long release schedules for stakers, seed investors and founders. There are more projects in the pipeline after this game that will give token holders a share. \n* Pokemon have a bonding curve, it is difficult to determine scarcity. It will be an evolving market that is difficult to predict. How does the current day cost of playing compare to the future value of your collected pokemon?\n* In the time between the player first committing to these multiple investments and getting to a point where they are selling pokemon for ETH, the re-sale market has likely changed due to the gold rush for pokemon tier progression, competitors selling their pokemon and the influx of new players. Hopefully it's towards the positive in a growing population base, but still further complexity. The 5 ETH in start-up equipment/pokemon/land might be worth half that when the player exits due to increased supply, so even if the day to day costs/sales have been a profit this could be a curve ball. \n\nThere are no doubt further variables and complexity that make up the entire structure, it is difficult to unpack. \n\nThere is potential in these games for inexperienced investors to come in and get absolutely fleeced while thinking they are working towards something positive. I believe we will see plenty of stories of nieve people sinking every paycheck into pay-to-earn games with the belief they are close to making it while their fees are distributed to token holders. \n\nMuch like the slot-machines in my country, but with a revenue distribution model to the protocol investors instead of current shareholders.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Good post, I&#39;d like to tack on some of my own musings but don&#39;t mean it as a counter-point to your explanation.

The complexity of the scoring system obsfuscates the fact that it is unlikely that a player would ever win before running out of money, or that the value of the prizes won would ever equal the amount of money spent chasing them.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll use Illuvium as an example since it&#39;s one i&#39;m actually keen to play and IMO has a pretty fair system so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To earn you need to pay, you will need specific items that increase your potential to capture the higher ranking pokemon. Weapon and armor, shards to capture, travel costs, rocket boots to get to better locations. All with different rarities, use-cases and costs. You will need to buy these in ETH or craft. Players will be initially hesitant to sell collected pokemon because those pokemon could be used to collect higher tier pokemon so this is an additional cost or opportunity cost. </li>\n<li>If you craft items you will need to buy multiple other items with ETH such as fuel which is created by land. </li>\n<li>If you own a land to create the fuel it costs you an upfront ETH amount for the land then you need buildings on it to create the fuel which will cost other materials that you either need buildings for or buy with ETH. There are other revenue streams from this land you need to consider in your cost/benefit. There will be 20% of land issued in peak NFT mania, is this a good investment, should you buy land at release instead, how is the remaining 80% of land going impact the cost/benefit of your fuel production?</li>\n<li>There is a token that can be used for many expenses in the game which you derive from staking the main token. Those expenses are in turn paid back to holders of the main token.  However if you use this token you are forfeiting the main token rewards that would compound and give more revenue share. These main tokens would be locked for one year, so try and weigh the current value of the expense reduction with the future value of the token in one year plus compounding and revenue distribution. Players should compare this approach with the other option of paying for everything in ETH, how many users are going to use the sub token thereby impacting value of that token, and in these years is the price of ETH going to be a better hold?</li>\n<li>The main token has an insane three year issuance rate with high staking, but all claims for the in-game expense token are burnt from the main supply. There are long release schedules for stakers, seed investors and founders. There are more projects in the pipeline after this game that will give token holders a share. </li>\n<li>Pokemon have a bonding curve, it is difficult to determine scarcity. It will be an evolving market that is difficult to predict. How does the current day cost of playing compare to the future value of your collected pokemon?</li>\n<li>In the time between the player first committing to these multiple investments and getting to a point where they are selling pokemon for ETH, the re-sale market has likely changed due to the gold rush for pokemon tier progression, competitors selling their pokemon and the influx of new players. Hopefully it&#39;s towards the positive in a growing population base, but still further complexity. The 5 ETH in start-up equipment/pokemon/land might be worth half that when the player exits due to increased supply, so even if the day to day costs/sales have been a profit this could be a curve ball. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are no doubt further variables and complexity that make up the entire structure, it is difficult to unpack. </p>\n\n<p>There is potential in these games for inexperienced investors to come in and get absolutely fleeced while thinking they are working towards something positive. I believe we will see plenty of stories of nieve people sinking every paycheck into pay-to-earn games with the belief they are close to making it while their fees are distributed to token holders. </p>\n\n<p>Much like the slot-machines in my country, but with a revenue distribution model to the protocol investors instead of current shareholders.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-19 21:14:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h9mg2l3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p78a2k","parent_id":"t1_h9m6fhg","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/interweaver","body":"I agree that excess complexity in a game's economic models constitutes friction for new players.

If we were to actually start  \ntrying to pay just the yearly interest we owe at the end of each year -  \nI believe it would account for 40% - 60% of our entire yearly GDP! And as the  \ntotal debt increases due to QE, other policies and the compounding of the  \ndebt's interest rate - this means the US is basically insolvent now.\n\n  \nThe US financial system is in the most precarious spot it  \nhas ever been in history. If the FED raises interest rates - stocks will fall,  \nhousing prices will drop, US total debt increases due to the rate hike and  \ncompanies will cut jobs. If the FED continues with low interest rates or 0%  \nrates - inflation persists with the risk of hyperinflation, asset prices  \ncontinue to rise, less purchasing power for the individual, continued wealth  \ndivide and growth continues to decline. The FED literally has no more options  \nto right this ship in any meaningful way - its a lose vs lose.\n\n  \nSo what are our options?\n\n  \nContinue with the fiat system? No. Sure, we can continue to  \nkick the can down the road but it will only exacerbate the issue and cause the  \n\"day of reckoning\" to be much worse when the fateful day comes.\n\n  \nGo back to the Gold Standard? No. Why? We already tried that  \nand it failed. On a gold standard you are still able to manipulate the gold  \nbacked securities issued in this type of system. Central agencies that own the  \ngold can sell the same ounce of gold to you on paper to another person without  \nyou ever knowing about it. Which person in this instance really has  \n\"ownership\" of that ounce of gold? Do you really want to trust a  \ncentral entity to decide which of you technically owns it? \n\n  \nSo gold is off the table. Continuing fiat is off the table.  \nHow about implementing a world currency backed by a \"basket of currency  \nassets\" or a \"basket of real-world assets\"? Maybe, but the  \nlogistical implementation would be a nightmare. Sovereign nations' currencies  \nthat make up these baskets would still be able to promote their own agendas and  \nperpetuate fraud and abuse. It would also further the centralization of the  \nmonetary system globally - since this type of system would be easier to manipulate due to the direct control of the basket owners but harder to detect manipulation by the general public or non-basket participants simply due to lack of access or transparency. The  \nUS dollar joining as \"just another asset\" in a basket of currencies would be  \nconsidered a failure since it would lose its role and power as the world's  \nreserve currency.  It would mean an admission that US capitalism failed.\n\n  \nBoth the US and Crypto are vectoring towards an inevitable  \nintersection point - and the timing couldn't be any better IMO! China and  \nRussia - as well as some other prominent countries - have been buying hordes of  \ngold (as silently as possible) over the past decade(s) with economists  \nspeculating their reason for doing so is to have their native currencies backed  \nby \"their new fortunes in gold\" and possibly uprooting the US dollar  \nas the main world reserve currency. The theory is that the US doesn't actually  \nhave the large amounts of gold as they are thought to have had since the 1970s  \nand why Fort Knox's gold reserves haven't been outside audited... since the  \n70s.  So if we believe this to be true - the US cannot go back to a gold  \nstandard as we just simply don't have the gold or enough gold compared to a  \nChina or Russia to compete.   \nReally the only solution for the US and the world - is  \ncryptocurrency. A digital, mathematically provable scarce asset that can  \ntransfer value across the internet unabated and uncensored and almost instant.  \nIts truly shocking that more people haven't had this epiphany yet...   \nEverything is becoming digitized.

We are experiencing and participating in a digital gold rush largely unnoticed and ignored by billions!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>USA future macro world view:</p>\n\n<p>The total US federal debt has officially crossed the Rubicon<br/>\n- the imaginary line in the sand where the US is unable to even pay down the<br/>\nyearly interest rate or risk a financial collapse. If we were to actually start<br/>\ntrying to pay just the yearly interest we owe at the end of each year -<br/>\nI believe it would account for 40% - 60% of our entire yearly GDP! And as the<br/>\ntotal debt increases due to QE, other policies and the compounding of the<br/>\ndebt&#39;s interest rate - this means the US is basically insolvent now.</p>\n\n<p>The US financial system is in the most precarious spot it<br/>\nhas ever been in history. If the FED raises interest rates - stocks will fall,<br/>\nhousing prices will drop, US total debt increases due to the rate hike and<br/>\ncompanies will cut jobs. If the FED continues with low interest rates or 0%<br/>\nrates - inflation persists with the risk of hyperinflation, asset prices<br/>\ncontinue to rise, less purchasing power for the individual, continued wealth<br/>\ndivide and growth continues to decline. The FED literally has no more options<br/>\nto right this ship in any meaningful way - its a lose vs lose.</p>\n\n<p>So what are our options?</p>\n\n<p>Continue with the fiat system? No. Sure, we can continue to<br/>\nkick the can down the road but it will only exacerbate the issue and cause the<br/>\n&quot;day of reckoning&quot; to be much worse when the fateful day comes.</p>\n\n<p>Go back to the Gold Standard? No. Why? We already tried that<br/>\nand it failed. On a gold standard you are still able to manipulate the gold<br/>\nbacked securities issued in this type of system. Central agencies that own the<br/>\ngold can sell the same ounce of gold to you on paper to another person without<br/>\nyou ever knowing about it. Which person in this instance really has<br/>\n&quot;ownership&quot; of that ounce of gold? Do you really want to trust a<br/>\ncentral entity to decide which of you technically owns it? </p>\n\n<p>So gold is off the table. Continuing fiat is off the table.<br/>\nHow about implementing a world currency backed by a &quot;basket of currency<br/>\nassets&quot; or a &quot;basket of real-world assets&quot;? Maybe, but the<br/>\nlogistical implementation would be a nightmare. Sovereign nations&#39; currencies<br/>\nthat make up these baskets would still be able to promote their own agendas and<br/>\nperpetuate fraud and abuse. It would also further the centralization of the<br/>\nmonetary system globally - since this type of system would be easier to manipulate due to the direct control of the basket owners but harder to detect manipulation by the general public or non-basket participants simply due to lack of access or transparency. The<br/>\nUS dollar joining as &quot;just another asset&quot; in a basket of currencies would be<br/>\nconsidered a failure since it would lose its role and power as the world&#39;s<br/>\nreserve currency.  It would mean an admission that US capitalism failed.</p>\n\n<p>Both the US and Crypto are vectoring towards an inevitable<br/>\nintersection point - and the timing couldn&#39;t be any better IMO! China and<br/>\nRussia - as well as some other prominent countries - have been buying hordes of<br/>\ngold (as silently as possible) over the past decade(s) with economists<br/>\nspeculating their reason for doing so is to have their native currencies backed<br/>\nby &quot;their new fortunes in gold&quot; and possibly uprooting the US dollar<br/>\nas the main world reserve currency. The theory is that the US doesn&#39;t actually<br/>\nhave the large amounts of gold as they are thought to have had since the 1970s<br/>\nand why Fort Knox&#39;s gold reserves haven&#39;t been outside audited... since the<br/>\n70s.  So if we believe this to be true - the US cannot go back to a gold<br/>\nstandard as we just simply don&#39;t have the gold or enough gold compared to a<br/>\nChina or Russia to compete.<br/>\nReally the only solution for the US and the world - is<br/>\ncryptocurrency. A digital, mathematically provable scarce asset that can<br/>\ntransfer value across the internet unabated and uncensored and almost instant.<br/>\nIts truly shocking that more people haven&#39;t had this epiphany yet...<br/>\nEverything is becoming digitized. Each new generation is<br/>\nbecoming more and more antiquated with technology and increasingly socially<br/>\nconnected thru electrons. The adoption of cryptocurrencies for this reason<br/>\nalone will continue to grow and invade all aspects of society and daily life.</p>\n\n<p>What else is there? No one wants anarchy or war. But in the<br/>\nevent where a financial collapse occurs - a transition to a new and/or unproven<br/>\nmonetary system in a highly-reactionary environment could potentially make<br/>\nthings worse - especially long-term.<br/>\nTruly the only option at this moment in time is crypto.</p>\n\n<p>Which is why I think blockchain technology will be adopted by US regulators and<br/>\nthe US governing body sooner rather than later.
