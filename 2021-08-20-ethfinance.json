Weekly Markets Update! Now that it's weekly, all numbers are weekly unless otherwise stated.\n\nCrypto:\n\n* BTC - Bull hammering through the 50% retrace line at 47k on declining volume. It looks even more likely my prior prediction that it'd see 51k (much stronger 61.8% fib line) before the September dump truck comes to fruition. I would be unwinding long positions at this juncture.\n* ETH - Hanging in there, but rarely does ETH perform at this time of year. Look for it to hold on as best it can during BTC's upcoming movements. The 2021 upward trendline would see ETH/BTC revisit 0.061. A capitulation (often in Sept-Nov) could go as low as 0.048 (the lowest fib on the four-year trendline from last cycle).\n\nForex and Equities:\n\n* S&P 500 (4441.68) continues to trick and slap traders. A red pin bar that successfully tested the 10W MA support at 4360. Bulls remain in control and bears won't get another chance until 4380 in the REAL not futures sessions. Neutral to bullish, and extremely cautious.\n* Nasdaq (15092) finished down a bit week over week but ultimately a green pin bar after the gap down. The Nasdaq tends to be the worst of the indices in the already weak September. But you've got the clear bounce off 10W support alongside the fact it's clearly trying to turn over on weakness. I'll be honest that I can't read this one. Neutral?\n* Small caps (IWM) (215.52) - The weakest of all indices right now, I was ready to call the very first broken technicals we've seen all year in the midst of the week. A close below 214 would've told that story. Don't mistake me: small caps look awful. Truly awful, with two straight months of rejection above and now closing well below the 10W. Clearly they haven't been any kind of bellwether for the larger indices. However, it does confirm growth is off the table something you typically see in more risk-off environments. Neutral bearish.\n* Speaking of risk-off let's get to the real spectacle... Look at that US Dollar index (DXY) breaking out. Easily the story of the week, the dollar exploded past resistance at 93 to settled at 93.46. It's a new high for 2021 and appears poised to confirm a double bottom on both the weekly AND monthly charts. There's volume resistance at 94 and then 94.50 is the final barrier to confirmation. After that it's clear skies to 96 and a very risk-off winter (in the Northern Hemisphere). Very bearish.\n* That doesn't matter unless there's confluence, of which we get not a lot from 10-Year Yields (1.259).  They had a rough week but still successfully bounced off the 50W MA at 1.22. Mostly coiling. Rising yields often make for weak tech stocks and vice versa, so depending on how the bands break, watch for it to affect different sectors, well, differently. Neutral bearish.\n* What does scream risk-off are the big bond closes. TLT (150.55) and TLH (152.52). Both shattered the 50W MA resistances to close above for the first time since... November 2020 (gulp).  The latter being a less impressive but more telling close of the two. The market lives and breathes the 10Y period. And bonds, while being the slowest saddest \"investment\" vehicle are ironically the fastest to detect trends. Surging bonds represent flight to safety from volatile assets and so you can't not take note of this development on big old macro chart. Very bearish.\n* VIX volatility index closed at 18.55, its highest since the week of June 14. So there's movement and some nervousness in markets, but being below 22 and certainly 20 means the markets aren't fearful yet. With it letting off steam this week, I don't think VIX bulls (do those exist) will get a fearful market for at least a few more weeks. Neutral.\n* Lastly, I want to highlight the energy sector XLE (45.89). Why? It broke technical structure. Okay but WHY do we care? Because the decline of XLE typically denotes the peak of a bull market cycle. This does not mean the bull is over for equities or crypto. First, because it's only a historical note and second because the markets can just... cycle right back after a cooldown. But it's also the clearest broken chart, falling below all of its 2021 support at 46.20 as well as its 2020 mid-year relief rally (46.40). And so we watch. Neutral bearish.\n\nQCCC? No that's not a new index fund, it means... Questions? Comments? Concerns? Criticism? Let me have it. Do you prefer a weekly update to my pseudo-daily ones (which were exhausting)?\n\nCheers!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So much pent-up excitement... Weekly Markets Update!

We would rather make a system with modules that can be swapped in and out, and that way we can have upgradeability built into it, but without using experimental design patterns in DeFi. Another thing that we did in Alchemix was, we limited contract interactions to only externally owned accounts. So no smart contracts can interact without having speed one. And we did that as a draconian safety layer for Alchemix because there\u2019s all sorts of weird economic attacks that can be done if somebody has enough capital.

They miss that peer reviewed processes slow software development to a crawl, and in the technology sector, the most-peer-reviewed product usually doesn't win over the product two young CS grads produced in their garage.\n\nPeople see that Cardano has interoperability with Ethereum. They miss that that interoperability is through the \"ERC-20 converter\" which doesn't exist yet, is a misnomer, and is just a simple token bridge, and through the KEVM compatibility layer, which also doesn't exist yet, and is a sidechain separate from the rest of Cardano. They also miss that because Cardano's eUTxO system is so different from Ethereum's account system, any contracts that want to migrate to Cardano natively need to be completely rewritten from the ground up.\n\nPeople see that Cardano has a low \"price\". They miss the entire concept of market cap.\n\nPeople see that Cardano makes it easy to \"stake\" and earn money. They miss that they're only delegating, not truly staking, and that they're being paid out of inflation. They also miss the safety ramifications of the concentration of block producers, and the lack of slashing in the protocol.\n\nPeople see that Cardano uses a eUTxO system which makes it theoretically more scalable. They miss that we are at least a decade away from squeezing the last ounces of scalability we can from account-based systems, and by that time account-based systems will be scalable \"enough\".\n\nPeople see that Cardano has small, fixed fees which makes it nice to transact with. They miss that fixed fees cause ever-lengthening transaction queues when a blockchain starts attracting real traffic, and variable fees are the only way for a blockchain to deal with variable demand for block space.\n\nPeople see that Hydra scales Cardano to 1 million + tps. They miss that it's still in the theoretical stage, and even when it materializes two IOHK-lubins from now, it will have limitations inherent to state channels and akin to Bitcoin's Lightning network, such as certain actors needing to be online to catch and prevent fraud.\n\nPeople see that Haskell gives you a lot of tooks to write correct code, including tools for formal verification.
