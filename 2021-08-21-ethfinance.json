It has generative art on the crew members, nice graphics in game, and you'll be able to mine resources from the asteroids. Will run on Eth zk rollups. The next sale will be about 10k asteroids with a crew member included on each of them. Genesis asteroids are already at a x8 or so valuation vs Eth.\n\nA bit more info from an older comment of mine:\n\n\nHey! Glad you popped in to ask.\n\n>How flushed out is this game as of now? It still appears to be in development\n\nIt is still in development but the earliest playable version should be released by the end of the year. PVP will come later than that though.\n\n>How does crypto work in the game? I see you can buy asteroids and other things using ETH. Is there any scamming potential from the devs?\n\nThis game can be described as a blockchain purist - everything that can reasonably be put on the blockchain will be put on the blockchain. That means ships will be NFTs, resources will be NFTs, asteroids will be NFTs, and even the game logic will be on-chain. It is a huge headache to develop compared to hybrid NFT games (centralized gameplay with a few NFT assets on the blockchain) but it has the potential to become the cryptopunks of NFT gaming. I'd say the scam potential from devs is near zero, but the delay potential is always there (common in crypto though).\n\n>What is the setting for the game? Is it set in the milky way, our solar system, or something else?\n\nDying Earth -> generational ship is fleeing for a new home -> mistakes were made -> arrive in a solar system without habitable planets but with the tech to colonize the asteroid belt. Unlike Eve Online or other traditional space games every asteroid has a different path and orbit, so the trade routes and distance between rivals will change every week.\n\n>How realistic are the game mechanics themselves? I\u2019ve been hoping for a realistic space MMO for a long time.\n\nIncredibly so. Hop into discord to see the steelmaking chain, details about the orbital mechanics, etc. Even things like gravity were taken into account, so if you're transferring material from a huge asteroid you'll have to account for extra fuel for the large gravity well.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/influenceth/comments/ovu6ac/what_exactly_is_this_game/","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Has anyone got any holdings? Any upcoming drops to look for?\nMy aim is to ultimately have more eth so just trying to ride the wave</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.influenceth.io/\">Influence</a> is what you&#39;re looking for. It has generative art on the crew members, nice graphics in game, and you&#39;ll be able to mine resources from the asteroids. Will run on Eth zk rollups. The next sale will be about 10k asteroids with a crew member included on each of them. Genesis asteroids are already at a x8 or so valuation vs Eth.</p>\n\n<p>A bit more info from an older comment of mine:</p>\n\n<p>Hey! Glad you popped in to ask.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How flushed out is this game as of now? It still appears to be in development</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is still in development but the earliest playable version should be released by the end of the year. PVP will come later than that though.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does crypto work in the game? I see you can buy asteroids and other things using ETH. Is there any scamming potential from the devs?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This game can be described as a blockchain purist - everything that can reasonably be put on the blockchain will be put on the blockchain. That means ships will be NFTs, resources will be NFTs, asteroids will be NFTs, and even the game logic will be on-chain. It is a huge headache to develop compared to hybrid NFT games (centralized gameplay with a few NFT assets on the blockchain) but it has the potential to become the cryptopunks of NFT gaming. I&#39;d say the scam potential from devs is near zero, but the delay potential is always there (common in crypto though).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the setting for the game? Is it set in the milky way, our solar system, or something else?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dying Earth -&gt; generational ship is fleeing for a new home -&gt; mistakes were made -&gt; arrive in a solar system without habitable planets but with the tech to colonize the asteroid belt. Unlike Eve Online or other traditional space games every asteroid has a different path and orbit, so the trade routes and distance between rivals will change every week.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How realistic are the game mechanics themselves? I\u2019ve been hoping for a realistic space MMO for a long time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Incredibly so.
