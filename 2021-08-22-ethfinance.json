There is essentially zero risk faced by people posting low quality content, so as long as there is even a small possible reward, the signal to noise ratio suffers, and it spirals quickly out of control as people who care about quality flee the sub.\n\nSo, how to make sure that doesn't happen? In fact, **how to create a spiral in the opposite direction?**\n\nConsider an alternative approach in which people posting content had the option to stake a few DAI on Arbitrum, which they would lose if the content was deemed low quality. This creates a totally different incentive structure.\n\nThe DAO could hold a fund that paid a team of curators, who would have a number of duties, including but not limited to:\n\n1) Determining whether questions posted to the sub were already sufficiently answered in a knowledgebase, and if so, replying with a link to the answer.\n\n2) For those questions not already answered in the knowledgebase, selecting/creating the best-formed example of the question, which would then have a bounty attached to it, taken from another fund in the DAO.\n\n3) Reading stake-bearing answers and deciding which passed the quality bar.\n\nBounties would then be distributed among the posters who provided the sufficiently high-quality answers. Answers which didn't pass the quality bar would lose their stake and it would go into the DAO to fund future bounties and curation.\n\nAs for who gets to be a curator, I imagine they would be chosen via some combination of current mod decree, and regular elections.\n\nConsider that once the DAO had enough value locked, a portion could be used for staking and low risk yield farming (the yearn DAI vault most likely), and the DAO could become self-sufficient, using interest alone to pay curators and provide bounties.\n\nI think the \"right\" way to implement this whole thing might be as a browser extension. In fact, ideally, it might be integrated as a feature in existing Reddit browser extensions like RES. **This way you could, at the click of a button, change your view of the sub to include only stake-bearing posts, or to include all posts, or even exclude stake-bearing posts, which would effectively hide the monetization aspect from people who are strongly opposed to it**. \n\nIf the mods and community as a whole aren't interested in this, it's understandable, but in that case, I still think it's a compelling enough idea that it would be worth trying in a new subreddit.\n\nI for one would like to have the chance to be compensated for answering questions in this sub. If you look through my comment history, you'll see I've answered many already.
