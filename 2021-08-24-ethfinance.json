Such an instrument is the turbo encabulator.</p>\n\n<p>Now basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance.</p>\n\n<p>The original machine had a base plate of pre-famulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented.<br/>\nThe main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the \u201cup\u201d end of the grammeters.</p>\n\n<p>The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and it\u2019s being successfully used in the operation of novertrunnions. Moreover, whenever a forescent skor motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm, to reduce sinusoidal repleneration.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-24 12:59:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ha7brtp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pagoum","parent_id":"t1_ha791s1","score":0,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethacct","body":"Rick & Morty [did it better.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMJk4y9NGvE)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Rick &amp; Morty <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMJk4y9NGvE\">did it better.</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-24 13:03:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ha7cg7j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pagoum","parent_id":"t1_ha7brtp","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/theFoot58","body":"my favorite is the Retro Encabulator\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpnEiOOfu1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpnEiOOfu1Q)\n\nthe Turbo Encabulator was also good\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>my favorite is the Retro Encabulator</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpnEiOOfu1Q\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpnEiOOfu1Q</a></p>\n\n<p>the Turbo Encabulator was also good</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-24 13:07:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ha7d3l9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pagoum","parent_id":"t1_ha7cg7j","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Liberosist","body":"Showerthought, abbreviation for \"rollups + data shards\":\n\nRads","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Showerthought, abbreviation for &quot;rollups + data shards&quot;:</p>\n\n<p>Rads</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-24 14:04:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ha7lkhc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pagoum","parent_id":"t3_pagoum","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Fuzzman99","body":"What about \"Rotards\"?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What about &quot;Rotards&quot;?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-24 14:15:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ha7n0qp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pagoum","parent_id":"t1_ha7lkhc","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BakedEnt","body":"\" Yeah you like that?
