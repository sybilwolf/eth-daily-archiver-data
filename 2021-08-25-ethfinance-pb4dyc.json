Yes, RPL rewards are paid out in RPL. But keep in mind that this is in addition to the staking rewards that the minipool is receiving in ETH. So, to break it down a bit more, for clarity and simplicity sake say every Beaconchain validator is earning 5% on 32 ETH. For a minipool, the operator is earning 5% on the 16 ETH they have staked + around 10% of the 5% the other 16 ETH in the pool are earning + RPL rewards based on how much collateral they have staked. So, in this case a node operator is earning about 5.5% ETH + RPL, and the other minipool participants are earning 4.5% ETH. The actual percentages will change, though, based on how many total validators are operating and how many minipools are operating. In both scenarios, the rewards are higher when there are fewer validators or minipools, to incentivize people to join up.\n\n2. Yeah, I don't think RPL is on any ~~DEXs~~CEXs yet. Based on what I've seen on the Discord, the Rocket Pool devs are against paying ~~DEXs~~CEXs to list them (as is the case for some other tokens), but they are more than happy to have RPL listed on a ~~DEX~~CEX if the ~~DEX~~CEX just wants to do it anyway. So I think if Rocket Pool becomes popular enough they will be listed on the major ~~DEXs~~CEXs. I also don't think the ~~DEXs~~CEXs will care about any conflict, they just want to drive traffic to themselves.
