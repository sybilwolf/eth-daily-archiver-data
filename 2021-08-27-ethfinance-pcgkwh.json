Listed price: 250 ETH / Highest bid: 29 ETH\n\n\\-----------------\n\nDo you see what's the problem with an asset that's blown up 1000x within 9 months and that has changed hands 3 times in its entire inception? Spread that all over the whole collection of like 500 or 10,000 pieces. What do we see?\n\nA massive vacuum in what I call profitable zone for early adopters. This is game theory in practice. There are 500 pieces. Let's say there are about 250 people minted this for free or for nothing. 170 people bought this for 0.7 ETH. Another 50 people bought this for 1 ETH. 20 people got in at 27 ETH. And the last 10 people with deep pockets just bought the last highest floor at 230 ETH, either holding or intending to sell for 500 ETH again.\n\nSo, game theory: because there are news of 10 whales accumulating 10/500 pieces for 230 ETH, the remaining degens lift the floor up, giving the illusion that everyone can sell at 230+ ETH or more. Thing is, this sentiments work in a bull market when everything is 'up only', 'this time it's different'. Remember, crypto is an extremely fickle place and sentiments swing from millionaires to McDonald's real quick. Just a 30% red candle wick will do that over 1 week, let alone a -80% bear market over 3 years. \n\nWhat happens when shit hits the fan? In the case of this collection, the first 250 people who minted this for next to nothing have a huge profit taking zone to choose from, since it pumped 1000x while changing hands only 3 times. So they can afford to sell at ANY price point between 1 ETH - 230 ETH and still be profitable. And there are 250 of them vs. the last 10 hard core hodlers who won't sell below 230 ETH. So the first of wave will try to exit by setting sell price 15% below floor and will still be profitable. The rest can 'buy the dip'. Remember, in a bear market sellers > buyers, so buy the dippers will get rekt just like previously in 2018. So it spirals out into a race to exit an illiquid market.

Now we see massive pumps and everyone with a jpeg says 'We are holding the next Mona Lisa we won't ever dump.'","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I am trying to compose a basic game theory perspective for those who feel FOMO in NFT and regret they didn&#39;t 100x their already 15x&#39;d ETH gains.</p>\n\n<p>Basically here&#39;s how most transaction history of art NFTs look like:</p>\n\n<p>Mint: Free</p>\n\n<p>1st Sale: Minter -&gt; Buyer Bob : 0.02 ETH 9 months ago</p>\n\n<p>2nd Sale: Buyer Bob -&gt; Bizonacci: 0.7 ETH 4 months ago</p>\n\n<p>3rd Sale: Bizonacci -&gt; Crypto Wojak: 27 ETH 10 days ago</p>\n\n<p>4th Sale: Waiting. Listed price: 250 ETH / Highest bid: 29 ETH</p>\n\n<p>-----------------</p>\n\n<p>Do you see what&#39;s the problem with an asset that&#39;s blown up 1000x within 9 months and that has changed hands 3 times in its entire inception? Spread that all over the whole collection of like 500 or 10,000 pieces. What do we see?</p>\n\n<p>A massive vacuum in what I call profitable zone for early adopters. This is game theory in practice. There are 500 pieces. Let&#39;s say there are about 250 people minted this for free or for nothing. 170 people bought this for 0.7 ETH. Another 50 people bought this for 1 ETH. 20 people got in at 27 ETH. And the last 10 people with deep pockets just bought the last highest floor at 230 ETH, either holding or intending to sell for 500 ETH again.</p>\n\n<p>So, game theory: because there are news of 10 whales accumulating 10/500 pieces for 230 ETH, the remaining degens lift the floor up, giving the illusion that everyone can sell at 230+ ETH or more. Thing is, this sentiments work in a bull market when everything is &#39;up only&#39;, &#39;this time it&#39;s different&#39;. Remember, crypto is an extremely fickle place and sentiments swing from millionaires to McDonald&#39;s real quick. Just a 30% red candle wick will do that over 1 week, let alone a -80% bear market over 3 years. </p>\n\n<p>What happens when shit hits the fan? In the case of this collection, the first 250 people who minted this for next to nothing have a huge profit taking zone to choose from, since it pumped 1000x while changing hands only 3 times. So they can afford to sell at ANY price point between 1 ETH - 230 ETH and still be profitable. And there are 250 of them vs. the last 10 hard core hodlers who won&#39;t sell below 230 ETH. So the first of wave will try to exit by setting sell price 15% below floor and will still be profitable. The rest can &#39;buy the dip&#39;. Remember, in a bear market sellers &gt; buyers, so buy the dippers will get rekt just like previously in 2018. So it spirals out into a race to exit an illiquid market. This will dump the price down and down, leaving Crypto Wojak with his 27 ETH jpeg.</p>\n\n<p>The point is, there is a huge huge vacuum in an asset with sales structures that go from: </p>\n\n<p>Free -&gt; 0.5 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 200 in 7 months.</p>\n\n<p>------------------------</p>\n\n<p>And don&#39;t forget that just 2 months ago Crypto Twitter was all like &#39;BEAR MARKET WE IS DOOMED&#39;.

I'm not particularly interested in the game itself (though it does seem neat and has more going on in the universe than Cryptokitties ever did), but I love auctions and a buddy of mine and I figured we could make some extra GHST to convert back to ETH if we played the format well. \n\nThese are basically traditional English auctions with a twist. ~26K auctions opened simultaneously yesterday at 9am CT. The auctions leverage an incentivized bidding format (i.e., bid-to-earn), which rewards you when you are out bid. The incentives paid out when you're out bid vary depending on the specific item and the % you increased the bid relative to the prior bid (e.g., you'll get a higher incentive % if you 2X the prior bid vs. a smaller incentive % if you only bid the minimum above the prior bid). The team is leveraging [Cryptograph's GBM engine](https://medium.com/cryptograph/incentivised-bidding-the-gbm-auction-c6dae5a756e5)  to run the entire thing. I'd love to see other NFT drops do the same or something similar, as these feel more \"fair\" (vs. single drops which are often botted), and redistribute some value as whales sweep the floors on some of the rarer items. [More info on Haunt 2 here] (https://aavegotchi.medium.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-aavegotchi-haunt-2-8bd086f9026c).\n\n\nWe expected to walk away up a couple hundred bucks, but have made close to ~$10K thus far. The vast majority of the meaningful price action is over (though auctions do run through EOD Sunday, and it will be interesting to see where things ultimately land; I'm sure some auctions will go crazy near the end). A large amount of our earnings came from bidding high on rare items at the outset, but we really raked it in when we (along with 3-4 others in Discord) realized that the portals marked as None_incentive portals were actually paying out incentives as if they were Medium_incentive portals. When this was first noticed, the floor for None_incentive portals was at ~34 GHST (compared to Medium_incentive portals which had a floor at 220 GHST). The Devs acknowledged this bug this morning, and have decided not to patch it.\n\nWithin ~90 minutes, we collectively raised the floor up to 200 GHST, earning between ~10-20 GHST per bid (e.g., 34->68 once outbid would pay out 6.8 GHST; 68->136 = 13.6 GHST; 100->200 = 20 GHST etc.). It was absolutely wild to move the floor in real-time. Apart from some local Metamask issues and some brief periods of congestion on Polygon (some bids close to ~9am CT were put through with 50K gas), things have run incredibly smoothly. \n\nSharing with you all here, because I think the bid-to-earn format is so interesting, and I'd love to see projects on ETH leverage something similar (though fees currently stand in ETH's way of being able to support something similar in the current-state). The amount of effort that this dev team's put into Aavegotchi is commendable, and their final products demonstrate some cutting edge mechanics that really stretch the functionality of blockchains in creative / fun ways. Additionally, following the community / discussion in Discord's been a bunch of fun, and I guess the gotchis are kinda cute.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve spent the better part of the last day participating in Aavegotchi&#39;s Haunt 2 auctions, and I&#39;ve had a ton of fun so far bidding on gotchis / wearables NFTs.

Through sheer weight of integrations and development I think that Chainlink will have to see appreciation at some point soon though.\n\nStaking on Chainlink is fundamentally different from other systems such as ETH 2.0. It will see node operators put up a security deposit in LINK (set by the requestor) for undertaking jobs. If they fail to perform (either through failure to maintain uptime or malicious activity) then LINK will be slashed.
