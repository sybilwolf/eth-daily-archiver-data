It may take all of September to do so, but stocks are solid and momentum is up, if weakening. If it fails hard before this close, $47k must hold or else a retest of the 20W MA near $43k seems like a good bet.\n* ETH - Copy/paste last week's. This isn't ETH's time so it holding on to the ratio is about as good as it gets in these nasty late August to early September weeks. 0.06 is a possible retest of support should BTC make a move in either direction.\n* News - Real quick, let's get Jackson Hole out of the way. The Fed governors want tapering in 2021 but not right now. Jerome Powell, his pockets slightly more full of bribes than his cohorts, thinks maybe this year but certainly not now and certainly without raising interest rates. In short? The bull is here to stay and could negate the typically sluggish September the markets often see. There are some things to watch for, namely regarding timing. The next policy meeting is Sept 22. Last time we had a tapering of buybacks, the Fed ALSO assured us it had no intention of doing so. Fast forward three months and they began tapering with nothing but a swift policy change out of nowhere. They can talk and act differently very rapidly.\n* Indices - Record highs all around. Little to say except that S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow are roaring toward the tops of their respective weekly Bollinger bands. Might see a little digestion next week but not much to sweat. That same pullback could be from a sell the news event now that Powell already spoke. Either way, a tiny retrace before more surging wouldn't shock me next week.\n* Dollar DXY (92.68) - The asset renaissance of course sent the dollar packing back down from the top of its bands. It lost the supports at both 93 and 92.80. Of note is that it did not envelope last week's green monster candle with a red. Therefore it's still above all MAs, still in bullish context, and still providing a small brake on equity surges.\n* Small caps IWM (226.41) - Huge performance out of the little guys suggests that, at least for a brief time, risk was back on for market makers. Closing above all lines for the first time in two months, look for IWM to maybe also digest and test the new 20W MA resistance turned support at 223.\n* 10Y Yields (1.313) - With tech rising today, yields were forced to close a weekly green but also reject off the 10W at 1.335. It's to be expected, as shown by Financials sector rocketing back upward.\n* Bonds - Finally diverging in technicals in a meaningful way, the 20Y TLT (149.46) had a red bull hammer to stay above the 50W at 148.75. Meanwhile the 10-20Y TLH (151.42) closed its red lollipop *below* its 50W at 151.92.  Both rejected their upwards trending ten weeks so ultimately the risk-on environment still has some brakes attached. At this point, I'll likely only discuss TLH going forward as it more closely reflects this end of year market.\n* Volatility VIX (16.40) - Closed below every meaningful line. Could there be a little digestion this week? Absolutely. Should bears be expecting any kind of jarring dumps? Absolutely not. The only thing is that the VIX has famously had some bounces off levels like 14 and 12 in the past, but no guarantees.\n* Energy sector XLE (49.31) - I talked about this last week as a bellwether of the bull market cycle peak (in equity markets) so I should follow it up. It recovered along with the other sectors today naturally, but is still in danger of setting a lower high on the weekly. Interesting to follow as fall nears. Right now the 10W MA is a clear resistance at 49.70 so naysayers will want it to rise back above and head for 52.\n* Speculation - An interesting thing this week is that every single trading session ended in a negative jam -- the roughly 30 min or less period at the end of a trading day when the big boys make their moves and tell the market where to close. Whales spent the waning minutes of trade selling down a bit. Is it to wreck retail traders in futures markets? Is it a telltale sign? Idk. Discuss.\n* Biggest Calendar Events\n   * Thurs 9/2 8:30 NYC - U.S. Trade Deficit report\n   * Friday 9/3 8:30 NYC - U.S. Non-farm Payrolls (for August)\n\nQCCC?
