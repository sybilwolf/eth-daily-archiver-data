You buy 1 ETH at $100\n2. When 1 ETH is worth $1000, you stake it on Lido and pay cap gains on $900 of gains\n3. Your stETH now has a cost basis of $1000\n4. You now earn x amount of stETH every time Lido updates deposits. When you receive that stETH, you owe income tax on the value of that stETH at the time you receive it (if you receive $10 worth of stETH, you owe something like $3 of that to Uncle Sam, depending on your tax bracket)\n5. Some time later, you've earned 1 whole stETH on top of your 1 stETH from depositing. You decide to sell when ETH/stETH is at $10,000. You pay cap gains on the $9000 gain on that first stETH you received, and then you pay cap gains based on the value of the rest of the stETH rewards when you received them. \n\nYes, that's a lot of deposits to keep track of. I highly recommend an automated service for this. \n\nCoinbase is a little different right now. When you deposit, you don't actually receive another token that you can trade. Their ETH2 is just ETH (IMO). You also don't actually receive rewards yet, they are tallied up in a tracker but don't hit your wallet until withdrawals are enabled either by the post-merge ETH update or by Coinbase. Therefore there should be no taxes to pay at Coinbase until withdrawals are enabled, at which point you will need to pay income tax on whatever rewards you receive.\n\nI am not a CPA, this is not financial advice.
