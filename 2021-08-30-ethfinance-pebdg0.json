The fundamental issue is that we\u2019re using money for Sybil resistance. Simply using governance tokens as a vote count makes money correlate super-linearly to influence. Vitalk [recently wrote](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) about this problem and it has been bubbling on my mind for some time. So let\u2019s start with the basics, how we got here, where we will end up if we don\u2019t course correct, where we want to be instead, and things we need to build to get there. \n\nGoing back to basics, we need to reach consensus. We do this by voting amongst a set of peers whom are unwilling or unable to collude with one another to dishonest ends. Why are they unable to collude? Well, if they collude in public others will rally against them. As a memetic schelling point, fucking over dishonest actors that are attacking the system is tried and true classic (see ETC). So, to conspire effectively, they have to do so in secret. However, as the number of peers in a conspiracy grows it becomes exponentially more likely that a leak will occur. This creates a game theory scenario that makes it profitable and safe to be honest and risky to be dishonest. The more peers you have the better this system functions.\n\nIn a blockchain, you inherit the problem of Sybil resistance. Addresses are free. So how do you ensure that all voters are unique peers? Bitcoin uses proof of work to answer this. With proof of work you get voting proportional to the cost invested in your vote. Once you vote, that investment is gone. To offset these costs your vote comes with a lottery ticket and occasionally you win the lottery so the expected value of participating is positive. The actual source of Sybil resistance is money. Proof of resources invested in a vote that can\u2019t be faked.\n\nProof of stake reuses this capital based notion of Sybil resistance. Rather than your investment being lost with every vote though your investment is reused from vote to vote which makes the system more capital efficient. However, it\u2019s still money proportional to influence.\n\nGovernance tokens basically just extend the ideas of proof of stake. Starting with the food token craze, every project today seems to need to launch a governance token. Without it, there isn\u2019t enough marketing power. Outside of some notable L2\u2019s people just don\u2019t have enough reason to care about your new thing amongst the thousand other things happening in Ethereum unless there is money to be made. A governance token distribution gets people to market their bags. This is all fine and well until it comes time to actually use those tokens for voting. Then several problems arise.\n\nThe first problem is voter apathy. When only 20-30% of the tokens are voting it gives outsized influence to whales. Most projects today don\u2019t directly reward voting. Even if voting doesn\u2019t take gas it still takes time and Defi is already past the limit of human attention if you want to be informed and vote on every project. There\u2019s just too much going on. Clearly if active voters are a required component of an ecosystem they need to be incentivized directly. This goes against pure buyback + make/burn philosophy of Maker and argues in favor of systems like Kyber that explicitly direct profits to voters.\n\nThe second problem has to do with coordination amongst a large number of peers. It\u2019s an age-old problem that technology has helped with but not perfectly solved. You can\u2019t feasibly have thousands of people in a meeting with an open mic. Active voices have to be throttled or every meeting will just turn into twitch chat and the system can\u2019t function at all. So how, do we throttle it? Often by voting weight. You get a handful of the most influential players in a room and talk about the most important issues of the day. This creates tiers of users though; those with a mic and those without. If these tiers are defined using money, even indirectly, then those with money have a categorically different amount of power than those without. Not just proportionally more influence, not just on another scale, but entirely new types of influence. If I donate $10 to a senator I get an automated thank you email; if I donate $10M to a senator I get direct personal access. Using governance tokens as we do leads to using money as a filter for tiers of power.\n\nGetting political for a moment, I\u2019m not suggesting a world where everyone has an equal say in everything. We live in a world today where we can\u2019t agree on basic facts even when ignorance is literally a matter of life and death and people are dying by the millions. We need a system that directs influence to those with knowledge and good intention and money is at least partially effective at this. However, each necessary participant in an ecosystem should have and retain influence. An incentive system should not allow the influence of any necessary actor to entropy to zero over time.\n\nThis comes down to wealth inequality and wealth accumulation. These are at historically dangerous levels and accelerating every year. In historic times this was about when French heads started to roll. I doubt that kind of reset is viable today. The wealthy, at least the type I\u2019m talking about, are no longer country locked, reachable in any material sense by a mob, or really accountable in just about any way for the evils they do.\n\nOutside of just the top sub point-something percent the real wealth of the world is controlled by institutions. This capital is granted the rights of people while being effectively international, immortal, unjailable, and legally beholden to short term shareholder profits above all else. It is a dangerous recipe. They write the laws in their favor. They can manipulate and endanger global economies and and are not accountable for the harm they cause. Even when they get caught and convicted in court they pay a few days worth of their profit in a fine and continue on with business as usual. The wealth gap is **staggering**. I really can\u2019t bold that enough. The gap is staggering, and growing every day.\n\nIf you are thinking that Defi is going to change that, think again. While Defi has democratized access to the financial system, the opportunities it provides still require capital. Once the regulatory clarity for institutional custody and voting procedures have been established these players will own crypto. Many already do and are aggressively hiring crypto capable talent. Wealth inequality is here to stay and it\u2019s only getting worse. If we tie influence to capital, we set ourselves up for a rather dystopian future. Whatever cypher-punk anarchist utopian visions crypto founders had, we aren\u2019t heading there unless we correct our course. So what can be done? Vitalik has several answers to this in his post. I\u2019d like to build on a few of them and offer something of a vision for a possible future.\n\nThe first has to do with a different solution to Sybil resistance than money. While I\u2019m aware of projects like proof of humanity and BrightID I don\u2019t think a social solution can\u2019t be eventually gamed. This problem exists today on reddit with bot networks that create a new account, post some repeatable meme, and then upvote themselves to bootstrap their account past the Turing test level. It\u2019s an endless cat and mouse game like spam filtering. In the long term I think we\u2019ll see a bunch of Legos taking the form of things like POAPs, some on chain history oracles, social attestation systems, and implicit KYC systems such as being whitelisted by Nexus Mutual and others. While no Lego is perfect the combination of them will be sufficient to enable systems like quadratic funding to function. This can reduce the influence of capital to alone to something resembling a logarithmic function rather than a super-linear one. I\u2019m working on one such Lego personally.\n\nNext, we need a standard delegation mechanism across Defi like xToken provides but tied to celebrity rather than \u201ceconomic mandate\u201d which is just too abstract to answer every governance vote. Delegation systems allow informed, public participants to rise in influence above their personal capital. I want to be able to shop for my representative to each project, delegate to them, and split the voting profits with them. Obviously this requires that more projects begin directly tying rewards to voter participation but I think this is inevitable. xToken is currently the frontrunner on a standard delegation platform but they can\u2019t support a representative system at the moment because they can\u2019t fragment the liquidity of each xToken. Either they\u2019ll need to crack that underlying problem or another platform will come along eventually and replace them. As a bagholder I hope it\u2019s the former.\n\nLastly, we need a good pattern for reputation systems that interplay with voting influence. If governance tokens represent monetary influence then reputation is inalienable (perhaps decaying) influence. Reputation would be earned against some combination of objective functions that each project could define. Maybe someone can build some type of pluggable oracle that maintains reputation scores for each project on an L2 which could integrate into snapshot. The details on this need a lot more thought. How are those objective functions defined? Is your monetary influence capped somehow by your reputation? Is there any way of discouraging people from \u201cselling\u201d their reputation by incentivized delegation? How do you solve the nothing at stake problem for those voting with reputation? It\u2019s a complicated topic that needs a lot more work but I agree with Vitalik that we need to move past straight token voting and this is one of the most straightforward ways to do so.\n\n[Self-serving link.](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is going to be a rant about the unfortunate end state of Defi if we continue along our current trajectory. The fundamental issue is that we\u2019re using money for Sybil resistance. Simply using governance tokens as a vote count makes money correlate super-linearly to influence. Vitalk <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html\">recently wrote</a> about this problem and it has been bubbling on my mind for some time. So let\u2019s start with the basics, how we got here, where we will end up if we don\u2019t course correct, where we want to be instead, and things we need to build to get there. </p>\n\n<p>Going back to basics, we need to reach consensus. We do this by voting amongst a set of peers whom are unwilling or unable to collude with one another to dishonest ends. Why are they unable to collude? Well, if they collude in public others will rally against them. As a memetic schelling point, fucking over dishonest actors that are attacking the system is tried and true classic (see ETC). So, to conspire effectively, they have to do so in secret. However, as the number of peers in a conspiracy grows it becomes exponentially more likely that a leak will occur. This creates a game theory scenario that makes it profitable and safe to be honest and risky to be dishonest. The more peers you have the better this system functions.</p>\n\n<p>In a blockchain, you inherit the problem of Sybil resistance. Addresses are free. So how do you ensure that all voters are unique peers? Bitcoin uses proof of work to answer this. With proof of work you get voting proportional to the cost invested in your vote. Once you vote, that investment is gone. To offset these costs your vote comes with a lottery ticket and occasionally you win the lottery so the expected value of participating is positive. The actual source of Sybil resistance is money. Proof of resources invested in a vote that can\u2019t be faked.</p>\n\n<p>Proof of stake reuses this capital based notion of Sybil resistance. Rather than your investment being lost with every vote though your investment is reused from vote to vote which makes the system more capital efficient. However, it\u2019s still money proportional to influence.</p>\n\n<p>Governance tokens basically just extend the ideas of proof of stake. Starting with the food token craze, every project today seems to need to launch a governance token. Without it, there isn\u2019t enough marketing power. Outside of some notable L2\u2019s people just don\u2019t have enough reason to care about your new thing amongst the thousand other things happening in Ethereum unless there is money to be made. A governance token distribution gets people to market their bags. This is all fine and well until it comes time to actually use those tokens for voting. Then several problems arise.</p>\n\n<p>The first problem is voter apathy. When only 20-30% of the tokens are voting it gives outsized influence to whales. Most projects today don\u2019t directly reward voting. Even if voting doesn\u2019t take gas it still takes time and Defi is already past the limit of human attention if you want to be informed and vote on every project. There\u2019s just too much going on. Clearly if active voters are a required component of an ecosystem they need to be incentivized directly. This goes against pure buyback + make/burn philosophy of Maker and argues in favor of systems like Kyber that explicitly direct profits to voters.</p>\n\n<p>The second problem has to do with coordination amongst a large number of peers. It\u2019s an age-old problem that technology has helped with but not perfectly solved. You can\u2019t feasibly have thousands of people in a meeting with an open mic. Active voices have to be throttled or every meeting will just turn into twitch chat and the system can\u2019t function at all. So how, do we throttle it? Often by voting weight. You get a handful of the most influential players in a room and talk about the most important issues of the day. This creates tiers of users though; those with a mic and those without. If these tiers are defined using money, even indirectly, then those with money have a categorically different amount of power than those without. Not just proportionally more influence, not just on another scale, but entirely new types of influence. If I donate $10 to a senator I get an automated thank you email; if I donate $10M to a senator I get direct personal access. Using governance tokens as we do leads to using money as a filter for tiers of power.</p>\n\n<p>Getting political for a moment, I\u2019m not suggesting a world where everyone has an equal say in everything. We live in a world today where we can\u2019t agree on basic facts even when ignorance is literally a matter of life and death and people are dying by the millions. We need a system that directs influence to those with knowledge and good intention and money is at least partially effective at this. However, each necessary participant in an ecosystem should have and retain influence. An incentive system should not allow the influence of any necessary actor to entropy to zero over time.</p>\n\n<p>This comes down to wealth inequality and wealth accumulation. These are at historically dangerous levels and accelerating every year. In historic times this was about when French heads started to roll. I doubt that kind of reset is viable today. The wealthy, at least the type I\u2019m talking about, are no longer country locked, reachable in any material sense by a mob, or really accountable in just about any way for the evils they do.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of just the top sub point-something percent the real wealth of the world is controlled by institutions. This capital is granted the rights of people while being effectively international, immortal, unjailable, and legally beholden to short term shareholder profits above all else. It is a dangerous recipe. They write the laws in their favor. They can manipulate and endanger global economies and and are not accountable for the harm they cause. Even when they get caught and convicted in court they pay a few days worth of their profit in a fine and continue on with business as usual. The wealth gap is <strong>staggering</strong>. I really can\u2019t bold that enough. The gap is staggering, and growing every day.</p>\n\n<p>If you are thinking that Defi is going to change that, think again. While Defi has democratized access to the financial system, the opportunities it provides still require capital. Once the regulatory clarity for institutional custody and voting procedures have been established these players will own crypto. Many already do and are aggressively hiring crypto capable talent.

Probably from one-off Reddit rants (OPs scenario was really perfect storm I'll explain later) or headline grabbing news articles. Or frankly just people who didn't due their diligence and are pissed about it.  The complexities that need lawyers and specialized accountants do not apply to 98% plus of US citizens. For about 90% of us, taxes are pretty simple and people would be paying $250-ish for a run of the mill tax accountant to handle it for them. Most Federal tax filings are probably less then 10 pages. a few pages of 1040 and some schedules. And for people who literally just get a paycheck (w-2) they can do their taxes in probably under 30 minutes. Seriously, no fluff... taxes really are that simple (or cheap if paying) for most. Scouts honor.\n\nMy point of all the above - whomever OP was talking about could have saved themselves that entire headache if called their accountant for advice. Same way you call any other service provider / professional / tradesman for help. And honestly capital gains are a really one of the more simple concepts. A question on Reddit (we all know we see it a ton) or even a simple search on the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions) would have yielded the answer. Typing that all out to stress there was no real \"gotcha!\" moment or \"only billionaires know how to comprehend it!\" issue... crypto to crypto is taxable and less then 15 minutes of research could have answered the issue **someone with over $1 Million in crypto gains** had. This was true in 2017 as well.\n\nNow on to what specifically happened in OPs scenario. In the US, taxes are based on the calendar year for citizens. You income, your gains, your losses, your deductions, your marriage status, children and dependents... all looking at year 20XX or 12/31/20XX. Some complexities are there for certain carryforwards, but for the simple taxpayer they don't apply or are fairly straight forward. And even then those 'complexities' are fairly run of the mill unless your really pulling some tricky stuff. But back to the point - OP's person had a capital gain (change in value of your asset, XRP) that was **realized** (aka, became taxable) because that person had access to that value when the ETH was effectively bought. That occurred in 2017. Then when the tax payment was due in April of 2018, the ETH was worth way less and thus that person didn't have the money to pay it. There is a loss if OP were to sell the ETH, but since that loss would be for the 2018 plan year, they could not go back and offset the 2017 plan year gain. Had both the gain AND the loss occurred in the same year (either both 2017 or both 2018) they would of offset and the taxpayer would have had no taxes to pay. It's a 1 to 1 - if the XRP gain was $1 million then the ETH loss was $1 million - no taxes. XRP $1 Million gain and ETH $900,000 loss, only $100k to be taxed on (20% of that or whatever). In short, the gain in 2017 but the loss in 2018 really fucked OP over here.\n\nThe fact crypto went up 350x and then down 90% is what made this seem wayyyy worse on paper... this scenario of 'being bury\\[ied\\] in debt' really was an edge case that was compounded by gigantic gains (350x), gigantic losses (50%+) and really poor planning / timing (with the plan year change). As well as frankly a lack of common sense to put in the research. Remember, for basically all traditional investments we are talking about yearly gains of what, 5% on average? Maybe 25% if you pick some big earner stocks. Hell, a 'once in a lifetime' year might be a 2x + on a Tesla. Same with losses. 5% losses, maybe 10%. 20% + is considered a 2008 / Covid type crash. 3500% up and 50% down is just not common and is really a case of OP picking an extreme example and thinking it's the norm / a tax dystopia.\n\nNow to 'the why' (before I drown you in an essay much longer). The concept behind all of this boils down to having the means to pay the tax. When you buy a stock, as long as you hold it you can't actually take value from it. AKA I can't buy my cheeseburger from McDonalds paying with \"oh, I own Apple when I sell it I'll pay you back\". So there is no tax until you actually sell the stock. At the time of sale, the IRS acknowledges you now have 'access' to the value and expects you to set aside enough money to cover the tax. Not doing so isn't illegal, but if you spent that $100 you owed to the IRS today, your effectively taking a loan from the IRS because you WILL have to pay that $100 back in April the following year. Specific to crypto, when you exchange your XRP for ETH, the IRS is saying that at the time of that transfer your XRP had $X,XXX value and by performing that action you are realizing a gain (had 'access' to that value) and at that specific point in time have the means to pay the tax.\n\nAnd to get into it conceptually / theoretically. What all this is trying to prevent is a scenario where people can avoid paying taxes for decades without being taxed. Take all biases on politics aside and imagine stock to stock isn't taxable. Instead of people selling Apple to cash to then buy Microsoft, they would just swap shares. No tax, great right? Not really... because then they can just keep swapping and swapping shares with no tax consequence. This would result in the government having no means to getting taxes now (edit: to clarify, means to get *capitial gain taxes*) other then hoping they go to cash or die.\n\nAgain, let's look past the individual situation / politics here and really think about how much of a dent that would put in tax revenue if all citizens were doing this. Or even think about the really rich who have the means to do this effectively. The 'why' comes down to just creating a gigantic loophole to avoid paying taxes. Potentially from 18 to death. Plus, economically it encourages less holding of assets. Like it or not, taxes & short term vs long term capital gain rates are part of keeping investment in the economy somewhat stable. There is incentive to buy and hold (and keep buys towards more quality investments) versus just cycling through stocks like a day trader.\n\nYick... way to long.

I guess that leads me to a few questions... How do you make sure your withholding is right? And how do they know to factor in spouses / dependents (or do you not have those?). I would imagine there is some type of check you do even for a basic salaried employee? \n\nNot sure if I caused confusion, but in the US your employer does withhold your taxes during the year. So when we do our filings it acts as a 'true-up' if you will of the full year. That's where you add your capital gains, investments... so on. Bring in outside things your employer wouldn't know about. Or correct their withholding. \n\nI would guess then the fundamental difference is you are checking someone else true up where US citizens do their own work (or pay someone). You system does sound nice. I would imagine ours is based on the \"American Way\" of distrusting the government / your employer to do it right. Or at least the 'do it yourself' attitude. Idk... I see advantages to both sides. It's ultimately do you want the company / government handling the calculations or yourself / a personal accountant. \n\n>\"If called their accountant for advice\" - who is this \"their\" accountant?\n\nIn the US, most personal (aka not corporations) accountants are 'mom & pop' type places where there are 2 or 3 head partners and a handful of people who help. Some are more 'corporate', like an H&R Block. The big multinational firms (EY, for example) are doing the complicated stuff. All accountants have to get their CPA license and it is pretty tough to get. I thought about this for a little... think of them like your personal car mechanic. Or maybe a personal doctor?

I'd say after 2018 if you were treating it that way in the US you were being foolish. In the US, when the rules are not crystal clear you go with what is called \"best practices\". I think in OP's case if you were going to claim crypto-to-crypto as not taxable in 2017, you'd still be smart to set some money aside justtt incase. That was a really aggressive tax decision at the time and it bit that person in the butt. \n\n>I actually live in a country that does not tax crypto-to-crypto\n\nI do think that there should be some threshold were crypto-to-crypto is not taxable.

They are the ones targeted by these types of rules due to their wealth and we are 'caught in the crossfire' with our $20 NFTs. Because if you say 'Only those who make $XXX,XXX a year can't treat crypto-crypto as non-taxable\" you start complicating the law.

I guess that leads me to a few questions... How do you make sure your withholding is right? And how do they know to factor in spouses / dependents (or do you not have those?). I would imagine there is some type of check you do even for a basic salaried employee? </p>\n\n<p>Not sure if I caused confusion, but in the US your employer does withhold your taxes during the year. So when we do our filings it acts as a &#39;true-up&#39; if you will of the full year. That&#39;s where you add your capital gains, investments... so on. Bring in outside things your employer wouldn&#39;t know about. Or correct their withholding. </p>\n\n<p>I would guess then the fundamental difference is you are checking someone else true up where US citizens do their own work (or pay someone). You system does sound nice. I would imagine ours is based on the &quot;American Way&quot; of distrusting the government / your employer to do it right. Or at least the &#39;do it yourself&#39; attitude. Idk... I see advantages to both sides. It&#39;s ultimately do you want the company / government handling the calculations or yourself / a personal accountant. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If called their accountant for advice&quot; - who is this &quot;their&quot; accountant?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the US, most personal (aka not corporations) accountants are &#39;mom &amp; pop&#39; type places where there are 2 or 3 head partners and a handful of people who help.
