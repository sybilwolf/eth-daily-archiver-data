He expects that this will cause an exponential increase in the price of ETH, and that increase will suddenly drop when those same people can withdraw and reallocate their capital somewhere else.\n\nI'm not sold on either part of his theory (the race to deposit or the race to exit) because the queueing mechanism smooths out any spikes, so people who only plan to validate for a couple of months probably won't even bother attempting to deposit. I also think those same short-term players will prefer to find higher rates of return elsewhere like they do in DeFi.

He claims that doesn&#39;t matter.</p>\n\n<p>What he&#39;s actually talking about is his expectation that leading up to the merge (when people are fairly confident that they will be able to withdraw in 6 months), everyone will deposit ETH and start validating in order to get whatever rate of return they can.
