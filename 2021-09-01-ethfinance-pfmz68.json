From the Arbitrum discord, by Ed Felten himself:\n\nThere are two ways you can compare Arbitrum with the Optimism system: comparing our current systems, or comparing the systems we'll eventually have.  Overall ours seems to be much closer to finished than theirs.\n\nComparing our current released code against what they released last week, ours has a fairly complete set of features for a rollup protocol, while theirs doesn't.\n\n1. Their release lacks most of the security features needed for a rollup protocol. For example, they have no way to submit a fraud proof, so if the sequencer posts a false fraud proof, the system will accept it. That makes it effectively a fully centralized custodial system (in the current implementation).  Our release includes a fully functioning system to submit fraud proofs, check them, and slash the party who tried to cheat.\n2. Their system relies on a centralized party called a sequencer, which is supposed to make promises of event ordering.   But currently the sequencer cannot make those promises, nor is their any way to punish a misbehaving sequencer.   By contrast, our release uses aggregators, parties who batch transactions together for efficiency, but we allow anyone to be an aggregator and ensure that a malicious aggregator can't hurt you.There are more unanswered questions about their release. For example, we don't know how to interact with it because they haven't released the contract addresses (to my knowledge).\n\nNow comparing the eventual systems (assuming they'll be able to solve some fundamental technical challenges that they haven't solved yet in their release), here's how it looks to us.\n\n1. The two systems rely on very similar security assumptions. Fundamentally, any honest party will be able to ensure correctness and progress.\n2. Arbitrum should put less data on the L1 chain.  Optimism's approach requires them to post a state hash after every transaction, whereas Arbitrum can execute many transactions between L1 postings (without sacrificing security).   For many applications, the extra 32 bytes of calldata per transactions that Optimism requires will be significant.  This 32 bytes per transaction calldata difference becomes more important as other optimizations (like BLS signature aggregation) come into play.\n3. Optimism will have a gas limit on transactions whereas Arbitrum will not.\n4. Optimism relies on an out-of-band compiler to translate native EVM code into a form that can run on Optimism.

And we don't know how the sequencer will be chosen.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thought this was interesting. From the Arbitrum discord, by Ed Felten himself:</p>\n\n<p>There are two ways you can compare Arbitrum with the Optimism system: comparing our current systems, or comparing the systems we&#39;ll eventually have.  Overall ours seems to be much closer to finished than theirs.</p>\n\n<p>Comparing our current released code against what they released last week, ours has a fairly complete set of features for a rollup protocol, while theirs doesn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Their release lacks most of the security features needed for a rollup protocol. For example, they have no way to submit a fraud proof, so if the sequencer posts a false fraud proof, the system will accept it. That makes it effectively a fully centralized custodial system (in the current implementation).  Our release includes a fully functioning system to submit fraud proofs, check them, and slash the party who tried to cheat.</li>\n<li>Their system relies on a centralized party called a sequencer, which is supposed to make promises of event ordering.   But currently the sequencer cannot make those promises, nor is their any way to punish a misbehaving sequencer.   By contrast, our release uses aggregators, parties who batch transactions together for efficiency, but we allow anyone to be an aggregator and ensure that a malicious aggregator can&#39;t hurt you.There are more unanswered questions about their release. For example, we don&#39;t know how to interact with it because they haven&#39;t released the contract addresses (to my knowledge).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now comparing the eventual systems (assuming they&#39;ll be able to solve some fundamental technical challenges that they haven&#39;t solved yet in their release), here&#39;s how it looks to us.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The two systems rely on very similar security assumptions. Fundamentally, any honest party will be able to ensure correctness and progress.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum should put less data on the L1 chain.  Optimism&#39;s approach requires them to post a state hash after every transaction, whereas Arbitrum can execute many transactions between L1 postings (without sacrificing security).   For many applications, the extra 32 bytes of calldata per transactions that Optimism requires will be significant.  This 32 bytes per transaction calldata difference becomes more important as other optimizations (like BLS signature aggregation) come into play.</li>\n<li>Optimism will have a gas limit on transactions whereas Arbitrum will not.</li>\n<li>Optimism relies on an out-of-band compiler to translate native EVM code into a form that can run on Optimism.  We used to do it that way, but eliminated that drawback and our system can now accept unmodified EVM code.

The article was removed not long after it was posted.  I mined about $5 worth and decided it wasn&#39;t worth the trouble.  </p>\n\n<p>2017 - A friend who knew I had lots of HDD storage told me about Storj.  At the time, they were using SJCX on Counterparty wallet.  Started learning about ETH when they transitioned to an ERC-20. Found my old Darkcoin wallet and learned that it was now called Dash and my holdings were now worth $100. Converted that to ETH.  Bought some GTX 970s to mine ETH, but didn&#39;t let myself buy ETH directly until I had paid off my mortgage later in the year.  </p>\n\n<p>2018 to Present - Bought a lot of ETH.  Did some more mining intermittently.  Learned a ton and did a ton of testing of all of the beacon chain clients through several testnets.  Staked at genesis.  Still trying to keep up with everything going on in the ecosystem.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-01 09:29:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hb7dnkd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pfmz68","parent_id":"t1_hb75usd","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/throw353964246away","body":"Nov 2020, the money that should have been flowing into metals wasn\u2019t I my investigation pointed to where it WAS going.

It was great fun and i learned a lot, but so far am at a pretty big loss due to transaction fees. Big part of this is that i don\u2019t want to have all my stuff at one spot to mitigate smart contract risk a bit. That caused a lot of swaps, approved and deposits which are pretty expensive even when gas is not 100 gwei.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve also started buying some defi tokens that i didn\u2019t have yet right before eth went on this run.</p>\n\n<p>End result is quite a bit of eth lost, at least for now.</p>\n\n<p>However, i still believe in things as aave,balancer, comp, convex, curve, sushi etc. So i don\u2019t mind holding those lps for a while and i\u2019m pretty sure i\u2019ll start turning a profit soon.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-01 09:57:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hb7hxjr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pfmz68","parent_id":"t1_hb79bct","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/forbothofus","body":"Amaze that this pump is still happening now that the Americans are awake.
