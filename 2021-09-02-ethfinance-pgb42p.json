Traditional finance companies know this game well and have mature processes for everything from securities registration to Know-Your-Customer compliance.\n\nI think a lot of people still assume that we will keep the current securities laws in place with the Howey Test and all that. I think that is an incorrect assumption - these laws are breaking down at an increased rate. The simple reason is that it costs more to litigate and enforce these rules than it does to ignore them. Technology advances are increasing this gap even though the traditional world seems ignorant of the idea. Also for consideration is that these are just bad laws for the current environment - securities are good things and we should be encouraging more companies/projects to be sharing ownership to allow customers to participate in their upside rather than discouraging it.\n\nThe SEC already was fighting a losing battle against layer 1 blockchains - litigation against EOS and Ripple get trotted out as SEC victories, but I see them as complete failures. They fined EOS $25m off a $4B raise and didn't even get them classified as a security. They took 8 years to act against Ripple, are still in the courts, and are quickly burning through their legitimacy as no one actually believes their \"we are here to protect investors\" line any more. Meanwhile VCs continue to fund layer 1s all over the place and there is really no sign that the SEC is going to go after them as long as they don't do really stupid stuff like EOS/Ripple did.\n\nDeFi protocols make their job even harder. These projects can move/ship faster and program their tokens in more creative ways. We have hundreds of established DeFi protocols already with zero lawsuits from the SEC even though there are many clear securities out there. Most companies that the SEC could sue in this area could easily just dissolve the corp if they lose a lawsuit and the protocol would continue to run just fine. We'll probably see a lawsuit or two this fall against DeFi, but I predict these will be the same kinds of pyrrhic \"victories\" for the SEC as the blockchain based ones.\n\nNFTs are far, far worse for the SEC. We now have every artist, creator and social media influencer issuing tokens. Many will be securities according to the Howey test. The idea that the SEC has either the resources and the political will to go after these groups is laughable. It is political suicide for politicians to take on social media influencers in this way. NFTs could turn these into serious political campaign issues and the traditional world is not ready for that development.\n\nWe need clear rules from the SEC around these things, but anything they provide will just be programmed around, so its kind of a losing proposition for them. In the meantime, we have so many grey areas that prevent the traditional players from doing much, but is providing a huge advantage for new startups. I think eventually they will go back to the drawing board and redo the securities laws to have simple registration and compliance for private equity with no accredited investor restrictions, but it feels like we are a long way from that yet.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it clear that \u201cdecentralization theater\u201d won\u2019t protect investor-owned companies from scrutiny and that governance tokens, which are all too often marketed and sold as investible assets, do not pass any Howey Test exempting them from regulation.

Arbitrum is general-purpose which means it's compatible with any type of transactions.\n\ni just asked my friend to send me some Arbitrum ETH (AETH which is basically ETH) to refill my Arbitrum account yesterday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>On a network like Ethereum which is based on PoW, this is utterlyimportant as executing contracts is costly and resource-intensive. Thatmeans less resources to mine blocks. Validators thus lack incentive tovalidate expensive transactions at the expense of block production.\n\nConsensus mechanism basically has nothing to do with rollups like Arbitrum. the same economic model still applies after ETH moving to PoS.

Currently they earn 10% of all card sales and have done incredible volume in the very short amount of time they\u2019ve been live. At the same time they\u2019ve done well to reward holders and encourage collecting. The \u201cSpecial Edition\u201d cards for example are limited in quantity,  will provide specialized animations and augmented reality features in game, (early vids on their Twitter of this look really promising!) and will be able to be used to redeem physical holofoil copies of the cards at a future date. Additionally, they have airdropped highly valued and rare NFTs to holders of certain \u201csets\u201d of cards, which has done well to facilitate trading volume and interest among collectors. In some cases those airdropped NFTs have traded for tens of thousands of dollars. They also have a \u201cMasterpiece\u201d version of each card, which entitle the holder to 1% of all sales of that card. Those have traded at an incredible premium so far, and offer a unique way to earn passive income from the success of the game.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-02 16:53:09","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-09-02 16:58:02","id":"hbdrsik","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pgb42p","parent_id":"t1_hbdppsy","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-02 17:29:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbdwcv1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pgb42p","parent_id":"t1_hbdppsy","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Savage_X","body":"Right, but why would game devs ever support NFTs that they didn't create?

Most of the Reddit posts about it (outside of their tiny sub) are from people trying to establish its legitimacy. (20% APY, $0.45M TVL).</li>\n<li>Curve. Big household name from Ethereum mainnet. Coincidentally also the first dapp on the list where, after depositing the DAI, I would be confident that it&#39;s still going to be there tomorrow. (12% APY, $6.59M TVL).</li>\n<li>SushiSwap/QuickSwap. Trustworthy, but with a yield barely above AAVE&#39;s DAI interest rate. (7% APY, $1M TVL).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The sheer degeneracy of some of the protocols just brings a smile to my face. Reminds me of the early days of the &#39;DeFi Wild West&#39; on L1.
