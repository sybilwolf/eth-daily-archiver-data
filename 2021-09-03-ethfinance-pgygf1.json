I mean, absolutely, fantastically, hilariously (and gloriously) wrong with my ETH speculation last week. It broke precedent. It broke data. It broke history. This is without a doubt the strongest Aug-into-Sept that Ethereum has ever seen. Bar none. From now until the blow-off top of the cycle, I'm done speculating. Just gonna lay down macro targets at either end. Right now, in fiat the support is at 3k (maybe stronger at 2800) and resistance at the top of our current channel is about 5500. In BTC, look for support at .07 and resistance at .0845 (the all-time 50% fib). There should be a fight at .08 as well, but being psychological it's not as powerful.\n* BTC: Not much to say except that three straight weekly rejections at 51k (the 61.8 fib YTD) wouldn't be a great look, especially if September seasonality DOES return. But I think given the environment, worst would be a small drop and retest of the 20W MA around 43k. Break 51k and 58.5k comes into play as the level that started the summer bear.\n\nequities et al\n\n* S&P500 (4535) - Weirdly jammed down EOD Friday. Not by much, but considering it was outperformed by seasonally weak Nasdaq and that Fridays have been bullish all year, it can be remarked on. Bears don't get another chance until 4420 and even then to get control they'd have to sell it another 100 points to 4320.\n* Nasdaq (15652) - Bucking seasonality along with the rest of the markets, the NDX finished up for the week. It's screaming at the top of the Bollinger bands and RSI, but unlikely to really take a break until 16000 it looks like.\n* Dow (354453) - Up for the week, but also flat. Continuing to diverge negatively from the above two but that hasn't mattered yet so why would it now.\n* 10Y Yields (1.321) - Up for the week in a bull hammer. Supports financials into next week, puts small shackles on tech.\n* Small caps IWM (227.96) - Green for the week but in an indecision spinning top candle. Risk is certainly on but not as much as bulls would love to have. With its strong retest and bounce off the 20W at 224 though, price action says bullish for now.\n* Bonds TLH (150.54) - Red for the week. The signal of risk-offers is just compressed to hell between the 50W it refuses to break out of (151.60) and the 10W it refuses to give up (150).  Bearish for bonds (bullish for equities) but it is STILL technically shackling a market breakout for the time being.\n* Volatility Index VIX (16.40) - The only remaining argument for seasonality hasn't broken yet. September, no matter green or red, at least always has increased volatility. There are a good number of bets at 16 for a spike. And then at each integer down, 15, 14, and 12 are historical spike points. We'll see what happens. Not much to speculate on other than will it pop this month?\n* Energy sector XLE (48.63) - It saw its first major rejection of the 10W at 49.50 after falling through earlier this summer. It's possible another retest of the 50W at 44.85 is in play soon. Regardless, it's in danger of rolling over again, confirmed down at 47. I still contend an energy peak heralds the peak of a bull micro-cycle in markets. Are we there yet? Is it coming? Is this dead wrong? Idk but so far, so interesting to watch.\n\nedit\n\n* DXY (92.117) - How did I forget DXY?! Well, it looks pretty bad. Stopped just short of rolling over, having held at the bottom of last trough (92.10). Blowing the 10W MA at 92.40 was bad, but there is good support at 91.70 with the 20W and 50W converging there. But it's much more likely to retest there than bounce up in the near-term, so quite bearish (bullish for equities).\n\ncalendar\n\n* Thurs 8:30 NYC - Jobless claims - these have been bullshit, ineffectual, or both so I wouldn't bother setting an alarm\n* Friday 8:30 NYC - Producer Price Index - I'm really reaching with this one. Again, wouldn't set an alarm. It's a very quiet week.\n\naddendum\n\n* What happened with the jobs report today? I thought bad news was good?\n   * First, how do the markets work? They go up on GROWTH not raw numbers -- even good numbers. So, if you get a really good report (eg. record revenue!), stock often goes down because to see GROWTH on that RECORD revenue requires another blockbuster RECORD revenue report afterward. Not every company can do that in a normal year, let alone during COVID. Similarly and more obviously, a really bad report also stunts growth. Company performing truly badly doesn't inspire confidence.\n   * So when a jobs report comes in like today, traders want either slightly bad news, which has been expected and front-run and can be easily turned around next time -- growth. Or slightly good news, same deal. Good news inspires confidence, makes money, and can hopefully be bested -- growth.\n   * The markets expect a slight downer in the report (650k jobs added for August, down from 750k in July) and instead got handed a despicable 250k added jobs for the month. That's why things teetered or went down on the report. They recovered by EOD, but that's the rough explainer.\n\nQCCC?\n\nCheers!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Weekly Markets Update:</p>\n\n<p>A tad earlier than normal but let&#39;s get the biggest thing out of the way first. <em>deeeeeeeeep breath...</em></p>\n\n<p>crypto</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ETH: WOW was I wrong.

We have people paying for a damn armored brinks truck with armed guards to bring their $500 bucks to the bank (using ethereum). Stick that shit in your pocket and drive to the damn bank yourself (polygon, bsc, etc). Ethereum\u2019s gas fees are this high because there IS NO OTHER BLOCKCHAIN THAT OFFERS THIS LEVEL OF SECURITY AND TRUSTLESNESS, and the market is putting a premium on that. Literally the most basic case of supply and demand. Like do these people think people enjoy paying these fees? Are people that blinded by tribalism/needing to be right that they think their coin is just as good and the market just doesn\u2019t know (I guess this one I can see lol)? No! The people making the transactions that do actually need that brinks truck are willing to pay for it because they are not gunna risk just taking a drive down to the bank with their 10 carat diamond. It\u2019s that simple. Even ignoring ethereum\u2019s roadmap (and the fact that in likely only weeks we will have direct bridges from fiat onramps to roll ups) the current gas fees would still not be a problem for ethereum\u2019s current value. Yes, being the backbone of web3 would of course not be possible at this level of throughput, but people will always be willing to pay for the security. So unless and until we see a blockchain offering the same level of security and decentralization, that is also cheaper and faster, (all before ethereum scales itself) NOTHING is dethroning ETH.
