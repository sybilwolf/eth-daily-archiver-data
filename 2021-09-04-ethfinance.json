You can either do everything on-chain (the way Ethereum works), or you can leave some of the work to be done off-chain.\n\nThe things you do off-chain need to be computed off-chain, and they somehow need to be relayed back to the chain. This is done using a sequencer/relayer.\n\nThis is what Charles explained right now on his little podcast.\n\nSo here are my thoughts.\n\nDoing everything on-chain is very clearly not feasible using the EUTxO model.\n\nAs for the off-chain part:\n\nEvery single dapp, yes, every single fucking dapp will need to host their own sequencer/relayer, or use a federated system to decentralize it at least a little bit (multiple relayers split across different parties).\n\nBut every dapp needs to do that. Imagine you're building a dapp and need to host a relayer, that needs to run 24/7. It's just such a joke of a concept, I find it hard to believe.\n\nEspecially in DeFi, this is extremely problematic. We have just heard of the SEC investigating Uniswap. And Uniswap's contracts live immutable on the blockchain. The Uniswap team doesn't host any servers, or nodes.\n\nIn Cardano, if you build a Uniswap-like DEX, you or a group of people need to run relayers. This is akin to the web 2 days where a company hosts their own servers. This is not nearly decentralized enough - how many dapps live on Ethereum? Tens of thousands? If Cardano only had 1 dapp, sure, you can decentralize the off-chain relayers enough so that it may be close to trustless. \n\nBut if Cardano has thousands of dapps - you can't possibly get enough relayers for a federated system for every single dapp - and the dapps themselves are all different in their coding, eg oracles do different computations than a DEX, so you can't use the same relayers for the different tasks.\n\nIn other words: This whole situation is still fucked, and just a complete joke. Imagine Uniswap hosted a relayer and the SEC comes knocking. It's a centralized point of failure.\n\nedit: another way to think about it is, in Ethereum, every node processes every transaction and action. In Cardano, the Plutus smart contracts \"allow\" (more like, require) you to actually process some of the computation off-chain, which leads to less state bloat and probably more scalability, but it's just multitudes more centralized.\n\nIt's the blockchain trilemma all over again: You always have to sacrifice something to gain speed.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So here&#39;s where my understanding of the Cardano smart contract situation is at right now.</p>\n\n<p>Using Plutus, you can code dapps in different ways.

Beyond that, the main takeaway of the lecture seems to be \"you were expecting fully functional smart contracts on the 12th? Well most of it will be off-chain anyways, just like Ethereum's rollups. No, we haven't actually built any of this yet. It will come in time, just keep being patient.\"\n\nThe first issue I take is his purported impossibility of making deterministic transactions on Ethereum - it's trivially possible if you just avoid shared state in your contract. There's nothing stopping you from using off-chain sequencing in Ethereum to prevent on-chain resource contention like is required with Cardano UTxOs. The difference is that with Ethereum you get to choose whether to do this or to use the default implicit concurrency model of shared contract state. No mention of MEV and how it's related to concurrency and critical in off-chain dex design, by the way.\n\nHe's also wrong about Ethereum's plan to scale using execution shards (in his words \"different computation domains, ahh, starting to look a bit like a Cardano style architecture\"). If you take the phrase \"different computation domains\" literally, Ethereum already has that with rollups. He doesn't seem to be aware of data sharding or the rollup-centric scaling roadmap that was posted a year ago to contextualize them.\n\nThere's no talk about how contract composition could work in an off-chain world in a decentralized way - hand waved as future work.\n\nHe says that \"all of their benchmarking\" point to Cardano contract transactions costing \"two orders of magnitude\" less than Ethereum contract transactions. What benchmarks, and do they involve the Cardano chain processing over a million transactions per day at that price like the Ethereum network does (or an order of magnitude higher if you include rollups)?\n\nHe talks about how the difference between Cardano and Ethereum is that Cardano has a strong root of trust, so that if any off-chain solutions blow up and fail, it \"doesn't destroy the main chain\". It's not clear why he doesn't consider Ethereum's consensus layer to be a root of trust in a similar respect, or why protecting the main chain from off-chain shenanigans is a property that's unique to Cardano.\n\nEverything about this lecture screams to me \"I haven't looked at the design of Ethereum since 2017, I'm unaware of their current roadmap, I'm unaware of the problems they've solved since 2017, and while they are busy solving those problems in an incremental and practical way, I am talking at a whiteboard about how someone could solve them in a theoretically perfect way while building tools at a five year lag behind the rest of the industry.\"\n\nIt feels like an admission that Cardano isn't a system for building useful smart contracts, it's a system for building systems for building useful smart contracts, and now that Cardano's eUTxO support is done, it's time to start building a system on top of it that will allow us to write useful smart contracts. It's really the long game, let's see how it works out.\n\nIt's kind of surreal that he spends part of the video strawmanning and otherwise attacking the people he believes are attacking him but are just raising design questions. First his bubble-sort stuff, then from Charles at 40:20 - \"They basically say well if you don't support my thing, and I don't see a way to make my thing work, what you have constructed is absolutely useless, forever useless, and is just a toy. Then they use vanity metrics without even understanding what they're saying. You're only at this performance level (well, just increase the block size) - oh well, okay.\" Well no, Charles. That's not really what people are saying.\n\n42:15 \"Reddit won't agree, Telegram won't agree, Twitter won't agree, guys it's noise and it's FUD.\" Reddit, Twitter and Telegram have some knowledgeable people on them if you filter out the noise.

By that point, Ethereum will have a budding DApp ecosystem on Arbitrum. Cheers Charles.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So today I decided to sit down and watch Charles&#39; <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FVA54yAaLC8\">hour and five minute &quot;Smart Contracts and Beyond&quot; lecture</a> instead of binging anime like I probably should have.</p>\n\n<p>While much of what Charles says in his latest video is true, and the lecture generally makes sense, <em>and</em> it&#39;s genuinely useful for understanding Cardano&#39;s approach better - a few of the most important points are either wrong or based on an outdated understanding of Ethereum, so it ends up undermining what I would argue is the point of the lecture - addressing the limitations of Cardano&#39;s design space compared to the incumbent. Beyond that, the main takeaway of the lecture seems to be &quot;you were expecting fully functional smart contracts on the 12th? Well most of it will be off-chain anyways, just like Ethereum&#39;s rollups. No, we haven&#39;t actually built any of this yet. It will come in time, just keep being patient.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The first issue I take is his purported impossibility of making deterministic transactions on Ethereum - it&#39;s trivially possible if you just avoid shared state in your contract. There&#39;s nothing stopping you from using off-chain sequencing in Ethereum to prevent on-chain resource contention like is required with Cardano UTxOs. The difference is that with Ethereum you get to choose whether to do this or to use the default implicit concurrency model of shared contract state. No mention of MEV and how it&#39;s related to concurrency and critical in off-chain dex design, by the way.</p>\n\n<p>He&#39;s also wrong about Ethereum&#39;s plan to scale using execution shards (in his words &quot;different computation domains, ahh, starting to look a bit like a Cardano style architecture&quot;). If you take the phrase &quot;different computation domains&quot; literally, Ethereum already has that with rollups. He doesn&#39;t seem to be aware of data sharding or the rollup-centric scaling roadmap that was posted a year ago to contextualize them.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no talk about how contract composition could work in an off-chain world in a decentralized way - hand waved as future work.</p>\n\n<p>He says that &quot;all of their benchmarking&quot; point to Cardano contract transactions costing &quot;two orders of magnitude&quot; less than Ethereum contract transactions. What benchmarks, and do they involve the Cardano chain processing over a million transactions per day at that price like the Ethereum network does (or an order of magnitude higher if you include rollups)?</p>\n\n<p>He talks about how the difference between Cardano and Ethereum is that Cardano has a strong root of trust, so that if any off-chain solutions blow up and fail, it &quot;doesn&#39;t destroy the main chain&quot;. It&#39;s not clear why he doesn&#39;t consider Ethereum&#39;s consensus layer to be a root of trust in a similar respect, or why protecting the main chain from off-chain shenanigans is a property that&#39;s unique to Cardano.</p>\n\n<p>Everything about this lecture screams to me &quot;I haven&#39;t looked at the design of Ethereum since 2017, I&#39;m unaware of their current roadmap, I&#39;m unaware of the problems they&#39;ve solved since 2017, and while they are busy solving those problems in an incremental and practical way, I am talking at a whiteboard about how someone could solve them in a theoretically perfect way while building tools at a five year lag behind the rest of the industry.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It feels like an admission that Cardano isn&#39;t a system for building useful smart contracts, it&#39;s a system for building systems for building useful smart contracts, and now that Cardano&#39;s eUTxO support is done, it&#39;s time to start building a system on top of it that will allow us to write useful smart contracts. It&#39;s really the long game, let&#39;s see how it works out.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s kind of surreal that he spends part of the video strawmanning and otherwise attacking the people he believes are attacking him but are just raising design questions. First his bubble-sort stuff, then from Charles at 40:20 - &quot;They basically say well if you don&#39;t support my thing, and I don&#39;t see a way to make my thing work, what you have constructed is absolutely useless, forever useless, and is just a toy. Then they use vanity metrics without even understanding what they&#39;re saying. You&#39;re only at this performance level (well, just increase the block size) - oh well, okay.&quot; Well no, Charles. That&#39;s not really what people are saying.</p>\n\n<p>42:15 &quot;Reddit won&#39;t agree, Telegram won&#39;t agree, Twitter won&#39;t agree, guys it&#39;s noise and it&#39;s FUD.&quot; Reddit, Twitter and Telegram have some knowledgeable people on them if you filter out the noise. Can&#39;t just deflect all criticism like that.</p>\n\n<p>44:20 &quot;If you still don&#39;t like the model, well then, just take the other model that you guys like. There you go. And just live in that model, and all that tooling is reusable, but the difference is they run on Proof of Work right now and they&#39;re super fucking expensive and we&#39;re gonna run on OBFT right now, it&#39;s kind of like what Binance Smart Chain is doing right now and it&#39;s a lot fucking cheaper.&quot; Charles do you understand how close the Proof of Stake merge is?
