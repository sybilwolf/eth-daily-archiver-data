I come here every day and love you all. And we have a jolly old time laughing at Bitcoin maximalists cause that stuff is batshit. But I think this community has been taking a wrong turn. Let me explain.\n\nLet's imagine a young person from Vietnam. Let's say her name is Linh. Linh has grown up in a country where 69% percent of population does not have a bank account. She has never been able to invest, exchange, lend or even donate. And yet as the saying goes \"if you are not making money while you sleep you will work till you die\". So Linh is on the road to work until she dies and keep her money somewhere in her home hoping her life savings are not burglarized.\n\nBut then blockchain comes around and Bitcoin and then Ethereum and Defi. Now Linh is young and intelligent and she uses the internet and she sees that people are able to invest and trade and save money by using their phones only. At some point she starts realizing that she can participate in digital economy and wants to, say, buy synthetic Tesla stock. She finally figures out a way to buy ETH (and this is, say, summer 2021) peer-to-peer and is about to start using it but then she realizes that \"oh no!!\", in order to trade ETH for synthetic Tesla stock (illegal in the US, btw) she needs to spend $120 dollars to make a single transaction. That is more than half the average monthly salary in her country! And then she takes the plunge and goes for it but her transaction is now stuck because she set her gas too low and she does not even know what it means.\n\nConfused she comes to /r/ethfinance and starts asking questions about how she can deal with this. And we tell her \"this is good, means network is getting usage you just have to wait for L2s\". She is confused, but what is an L2, I just want to send money or buy a stablecoin or stock. Then somebody tries explaining rollups to her. She thinks ok, ooooh ok... I'll do it, but how? \"Well, you have to bridge the tokens\". But what does that mean!? \"Oh and you will have to pay the transaction fee, which is about $80\", \"Oh and fees on L2 are still high cause it is throttling during beta\", \"Oh and then you have to wait 7 days to withdraw, but it's ok cause we'll have fast exits eventually\". At this point Linh is demoralized, confused and feeling totally left out. She came for financial freedom and experienced a road block at every level and only promises that \"it will be better you just wait\".\n\nBut then her friend Duc shows her another chain called X, which has a nice wallet and transactions are $0.30c, and she buys a dollar stablecoin cause her country's currency is not trustworthy. The fee is still a little high but she is investing in her future after all. But then somebody in /r/ethfinance screams at her \"nooo! it is not decentralized enough!\", \"you just have to wait a year and we will have fast L2 with easy bridging and fast exits and ZKRollups are being researched and we will have the merge and the data sharding which will raise data availability and then you can do it\". But you might as well be speaking Greek to her.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that Ethereum has been failing. It has been failing in serving the underpriviledged. It has been failing on being inclusive and democratic. And then when another chain comes along, maybe less tested, less decentralized we get critical of it. I think this is wrong. Chain X (whether it's Algorand, Avalanche, Terra, Solana, whatever) is doing good. It is giving people a chance to become a part of the digital economy today. Yes Ethereum is awesome, yes we have best L2 research, yes it is the most decentralized and yes I am very bullish. But today there are many to whom Ethereum is useless and to them it has not delivered on its promises. Maybe in a year! But life goes on and we US or Western European holders have time to wait but Linh does not.\n\nLet me finish with the famous quote by Vitalik from the height of ICO mania in 2017.\n\n>So total cryptocoin market cap just hit $0.5T today. But have we *earned* it? How many unbanked people have we banked? How much censorship-resistant commerce for the common people have we enabled? How many dapps have we created that have substantial usage? Low added value *per user* for using a blockchain is fine, but then you have to make up for it in volume. How much value is stored in smart contracts that actually do anything interesting? How many Venezuelans have actually been protected by us from hyperinflation? How much actual usage of micropayment channels is there actually in reality? The answer to all of these questions is definitely not zero, and in some cases it's quite significant.

I have decided that I will try and use it to scalp some extra income off of Bitcoin&#39;s much more reliable 4 year cycles than Ethereum which quite frankly could do anything post-merge since we have a triple halving which is looking like it will coincide with the beginning of a bear market. Quite frankly I have no idea what the end result is when the strongest possible tailwind (triple halving) crashes into the strongest possible headwind (beginning of a bear market after a blow-off top mania phase). So for my ETH stack, I just plan to cash out about 40-50% and never buy back with most of it, hopefully I will be able to use the funds to go to HODLercon/Hawaii 2022 and diversify into property if I have enough money to do that. I will hold the rest of my ETH for the super long term with some of it in cold storage and stake the rest of my ETH through RocketPool.</p>\n\n<p>As for stack multiples for this bull market finale, I have my eyes on $8K-$20K in Dec/Jan. I will probably sell 50% of what I intend to sell this cycle at around $10K so I can ensure profits were taken in the case that that is the peak. This way I can book in HODLercon. Then the other 50% is a bit of a moonshot which I will use indicators and on-chain metrics to try and time the top.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-06 18:56:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbvqlzh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pisps0","parent_id":"t1_hbuz8hf","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/towerjac","body":">Quite frankly I have no idea what the end result is when the strongest possible tailwind (triple halving) crashes into the strongest possible headwind (beginning of a bear market after a blow-off top mania phase)\n\nIndeed I've considered this many times and I'm eager to see what happens.
