Over these past few days I have finalised my plan. It is as follows:\n\nMy portfolio is roughly 85% ETH with the remaining 15% being more or less evenly split between BTC and the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI). For simplicity's sake, in my calculations I have converted my DPI and BTC into ETH at their current ratios (though I'm sure this is very optimistic for my BTC). I would highly recommend doing this rather than having to estimate what each of your shitcoins could be worth at the market peak.\n\nSo for my ETH stack, I just plan to cash out about 40-50% and never buy back with most of it, hopefully I will be able to use the funds to go to HODLercon/Hawaii 2022 and diversify into property if I have enough money to do that. I will hold the rest of my ETH for the super long term with some of it in cold storage and stake the rest of my ETH through RocketPool. I will sell 50% of what I intend to sell this cycle at $9.5K so I can ensure profits were taken in the case that that is the peak. Also, I picked $9.5K rather than $10K so that I can front-run all the sellers at psychological resistance levels. I think this is a wise strategy having seen the way that Bitcoin peaked so close to $20K without breaching it on most exchanges. As for the other half of this peak's cash out money, I am comfortable trying to time the peak. As some of you will know I'm a big proponent of many of the on-chain metrics over at www.lookintobitcoin.com for detecting peaks. I will simply cash out my ETH shortly after Bitcoin's peak since Ethereum usually pumps a few weeks after Bitcoin (3 weeks later in the case of 2017 and 4 weeks later earlier this year). Plus, many of the same indicators work on Ethereum, you just need to use other (often paid service) websites or calculate the values yourself. If you want to know what indicators I will be looking at specifically, take a look at this post I made a while back [here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/hiksh6/how_i_plan_to_identify_and_sell_the_top_of_the/)\n\nI also intend to sell all of my DPI and BTC at their respective peaks. However, in the case of the BTC, I have a slightly different plan. I have decided that I will try and use it to scalp some extra income off of Bitcoin's much more reliable 4 year cycles by shorting it (with only 1x or maybe 2x leverage since leverage is very risky). The incredible consistency of Bitcoin's cycle and the aforementioned indicators makes me quite confident in doing this, albeit with a relatively small percentage of my stack (for the love of god never use leverage or short with a big chunk of your stack. The last thing you want is to lose what is likely your only ticket to financial freedom, AKA your crypto stack). On the other hand, I would never dare doing this with my Ethereum stack. Ethereum could do anything post-merge since we have a triple halving which is looking like it will coincide with the beginning of a bear market. Quite frankly I have no idea what the end result is when the strongest possible tailwind (triple halving) crashes into the strongest possible headwind (beginning of a bear market after a blow-off top mania phase). What I do know though is that shorting ultrasound money is absolute insanity and I doubt that ETH will see another 3 year long 90+% retracement. Bitcoin doesn't have this issue, so I am much more confident in shorting it with low to no leverage for a few months during the bear.\n\nFinally, one of the hardest things to come to terms with is the sacrifice I am making by selling about half of my ETH with no intention of buying back in. I am convinced that in more parallel universes than not, I am making a decision which in the long run will have a very large opportunity cost. I genuinely see ETH going to $100K and beyond (even assuming no inflation) in the next 10-30 years. However, in the future realities where a black swan event destroys Ethereum or leads me to lose access to my crypto, I would be absolutely devastated. So much so that I think I would genuinely struggle to recover mentally, let alone financially. It's important to zoom out and think about the bigger picture. I have made a 20x return on my investment and likely it is soon to be more. Now I'm no millionaire like some of you fellow 2017 OGs. Unfortunately I was a broke university student trying to save literally every dollar for most of the 3.5 years I knew ETH at sub $300 prices. However, I am extremely grateful for this opportunity I have been blessed with and a $10-20K ETH would potentially leave me with enough money for a down payment to get myself on the property ladder here in rural NZ. Oh, and that is of course after a once in a lifetime trip to Hawaii with some of the coolest, nicest people I know but have never met! That's life changing money right there and I can't run the risk of waiting another 5 years just so I can be slightly better off. It is important to prevent greed from getting the best of you and diversifying into real world assets and experiences seems like the responsible thing for me to do. Besides, I'll always have half of my ETH and I have no intention of selling that any time soon. I want that to be generational wealth for my kids one day.\n\nAnyway, thanks for taking the time to read of all this. If you're somehow not sick of me talking about how to make an exit strategy, I go into a lot more detail [here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/ikgh45/do_you_have_an_exit_strategy_heres_why_you_should/)\n\nEdit: Also, if we never hit $9.5K then I'm happy to simply hold on for many more years. Selling the ultrasound money behind the internet's emerging value layer for any less than that seems like insanity to me in my scenario.\n\nEdit 2: Just a note on why I don't intend to buy back in, this is partly due to the unpredictability of ETH post-merge. As mentioned above, this is an enormous tailwind which I think will lead to it recovering much faster than BTC does. This will make trying to time the bottom much harder. Also, when you sell and buy back in you are triggering a taxable event, so you also have to beat any taxes on top of buying in cheaper which just stacks the odds even more against you.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>With a parabolic bull run finale almost seeming inevitable going into the last few months of the year and maybe Q1 2022, now is a good time to create an exit strategy before you get a case of the biased bull-run brain where you can&#39;t stop moving the price targets higher and higher only for your greed to get the better of you and your ever increasing target sell price never gets hit.

Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;ve had 100% success doing it in the past, if you play the game long enough you will guaranteed lose more than you&#39;ve gained, if not lose everything. </p>\n\n<p>All it takes is six hours on a completely normal Tuesday in September to wipe you out.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-07 08:06:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbxt4fv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgb5j","parent_id":"t3_pjgb5j","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/mrcarner","body":"Well, on the bright side, my wife and I are opening our third bottle of \"$3500\" Champagne tonight.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Well, on the bright side, my wife and I are opening our third bottle of &quot;$3500&quot; Champagne tonight.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-07 18:51:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hc0b16f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgb5j","parent_id":"t3_pjgb5j","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Chokeman","body":"EVM chain has become a red ocean market.\n\nI just don't know how to differentiate between each one when every chain claims that they are fast and all of them also sacrifice something (mostly decentralization) for better throughput.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>EVM chain has become a red ocean market.</p>\n\n<p>I just don&#39;t know how to differentiate between each one when every chain claims that they are fast and all of them also sacrifice something (mostly decentralization) for better throughput.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-07 04:50:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbx5nv6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgb5j","parent_id":"t3_pjgb5j","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-07 05:35:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbxa2xd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgb5j","parent_id":"t1_hbx5nv6","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/barthib","body":"Cardano is not fully P2P.\n\nMoreover, https://mobile.twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1430548484688596996","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Cardano is not fully P2P.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1430548484688596996\">https://mobile.twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1430548484688596996</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-07 05:43:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbxawhp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgb5j","parent_id":"t1_hbxa2xd","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/forbothofus","body":"EVM becoming a defacto standard for smart contract interop is incredible, next keep an eye out for solidity devs collecting licensing fees from L2 and chain creators to maintain their products on that chain.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>EVM becoming a defacto standard for smart contract interop is incredible, next keep an eye out for solidity devs collecting licensing fees from L2 and chain creators to maintain their products on that chain.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-07 06:34:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbxgtw4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgb5j","parent_id":"t1_hbx5nv6","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-07 08:15:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbxuekm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgb5j","parent_id":"t3_pjgb5j","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ArcadesOfAntiquity","body":"I just love buying","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I just love buying</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-07 08:23:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbxvm4k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgb5j","parent_id":"t1_hbxuekm","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/sgad89","body":"Well enough charts for the day","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Well enough charts for the day</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-07 08:22:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hbxvh2h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgb5j","parent_id":"t3_pjgb5j","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/BuyETHorDAI","body":"Hear that?
