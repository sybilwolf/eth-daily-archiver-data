At this point, Ethereum is basically a company that pays its profits back to ETH holders in the form of what's effectively a stock buyback.\n\nI'm writing this on ethfinance instead of the original thread because (1) I think this may be interesting to all of you, (2) the post is already 20 days old so nobody would have seen my comment, and (3) in general I don't believe it's productive to reply on that subreddit anymore, because they have demonstrated recently that as a general rule they don't actually want answers to their questions.\n\nGoing through some of the original poster's satirical points, one by one:\n\n> Is there an annual dividend currently and if so what day do we receive dividend and what's the dividend yield exactly?\n\nETH's dividend on an annualized basis is 2,832,000 ETH. Divided by the total amount of \"shares\", ETH gives a 2.4% dividend yield before share dilution (issuance).\n\n\"Dividends\" are paid in the form of share buyback, and accrue every block, or every 15 seconds.\n\n> What percentage of earnings are retained?\n\nNo earnings are retained, all earnings are paid directly to ETH shareholders.\n\n> Mining seems like a pretty cool idea but I try to understand and I can't get a clear answer, what's the product that all the miners are producing? Who is buying this product and what is our profit margin on this product exactly?\n\nMiners are producing \"ethereum block space\", which is a highly in-demand product. This product is sold at auction every 15 seconds, with gross revenue of roughly 3 ETH and net profit of -2 ETH. So right now the \"company\" is still in a bootstrapping phase where it is unprofitable, but not for long - see the next few points.\n\n> Honestly I should have done more research, but how does the company earn money exactly?\n\nThe \"Ethereum\" company earns money during blocks where the share buyback (ETH burn) exceeds the share dilution amount (ETH issuance). That value accrues to the ETH shareholders.\n\n> How much money are we spending on this mining thing exactly? \n\nMiners are paid roughly 2 ETH, or $7000, every 15 seconds. They also earn commission on top (tips, or \"priority fee\"), which comes out of excess fee revenue and can be substantial.\n\n> Does management have a plan to reduce our expenses there, or are they going up? Is the [Ethereum] company currently making a profit or are we still in negative earnings territory right now?\n\nManagement has plans to reduce expenses by roughly 90% by employing a new piece of technology that's been in R&D since about 2015, and in development since 2017 (Proof of Stake). Once the deployment goes live, projections show that the Ethereum \"company\" will become consistently profitable, as share dilution dips far below share buyback.\n\n> Is revenue growing?\n\nRevenue has been growing significantly since Q4 2020, and as a longer trend since 2015. During certain periods of chain congestion during NFT buying, Ethereum's revenue (fee income) has approached 100 ETH - or over $350,000 - in a single 15-second period.\n\n> What's the price to sales ratio? What's the EV/EBITDA compared to the competitors?\n\nAfter the merge event next year, Ethereum is projected to have a 2.1% net annualized income per share (which is paid entirely to shareholders, thus identical to dividend yield net of dilution). This gives Ethereum a P/E of 47.6, which is above Alphabet Inc. (Google), but well below Twitter, Facebook and Tesla.\n\nOn top of this passive income, ETH shareholders have the privilege of accepting a contractual role as stakers with the Ethereum protocol. This contract is paid, and is highly coveted due to the low amount of work it requires compared to the salary it pays (6% of the staked ETH, currently).\n\nBecause the Ethereum protocol itself does not hold debt or assets, and does not itself pay taxes, interest, or depreciation, Ethereum's EV/EBITDA will also be 47.6.\n\n> [Does Bitcoin] have a lower EV/EBITDA than these Ethereum guys?\n\nBitcoin does not distribute profits back to shareholders like Ethereum does. Their EV/EBITDA is undefined and thus incomparable.\n\n> Has anyone figured out yet what the insiders are doing? Is management buying or selling?\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation's wallet as well as Vitalik Buterin's wallet are both publicly viewable on the blockchain. Both sell periodically, and all this data is transparent on the blockchain.\n\nAnd for my last brave act, the ping: /u/mushroomsarefriends","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There&#39;s <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/p7ojqv/hey_guys_boomer_here_i_just_bought_some_shares_of/\">a post in /r/buttcoin</a> I just came across, designed to mock Bitcoin because it doesn&#39;t have any of the characteristics of a real, profitable company.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s remarkable to note is that I believe with the addition of EIP-1559, I believe Ethereum actually <em>is</em> analogous to a real company with revenues and expenses, and many of the metrics you can use to measure a company you can also use to measure Ethereum.

What&#39;s the EV/EBITDA compared to the competitors?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After the merge event next year, Ethereum is projected to have a 2.1% net annualized income per share (which is paid entirely to shareholders, thus identical to dividend yield net of dilution). This gives Ethereum a P/E of 47.6, which is above Alphabet Inc. (Google), but well below Twitter, Facebook and Tesla.</p>\n\n<p>On top of this passive income, ETH shareholders have the privilege of accepting a contractual role as stakers with the Ethereum protocol. This contract is paid, and is highly coveted due to the low amount of work it requires compared to the salary it pays (6% of the staked ETH, currently).</p>\n\n<p>Because the Ethereum protocol itself does not hold debt or assets, and does not itself pay taxes, interest, or depreciation, Ethereum&#39;s EV/EBITDA will also be 47.6.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Does Bitcoin] have a lower EV/EBITDA than these Ethereum guys?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bitcoin does not distribute profits back to shareholders like Ethereum does. Their EV/EBITDA is undefined and thus incomparable.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Has anyone figured out yet what the insiders are doing? Is management buying or selling?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ethereum Foundation&#39;s wallet as well as Vitalik Buterin&#39;s wallet are both publicly viewable on the blockchain. Both sell periodically, and all this data is transparent on the blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>And for my last brave act, the ping: <a href=\"/u/mushroomsarefriends\">/u/mushroomsarefriends</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-09 12:44:08","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-09-09 12:49:54","id":"hc7xisg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pkr4fx","parent_id":"t3_pkr4fx","score":61,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/phigo50","body":"I remember [James Wang mocked up a proper Q1 earnings report for Ethereum](https://twitter.com/draecomino/status/1394296083384348676) back along, imo it's a great way to get the attention of the tradfi types.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I remember <a href=\"https://twitter.com/draecomino/status/1394296083384348676\">James Wang mocked up a proper Q1 earnings report for Ethereum</a> back along, imo it&#39;s a great way to get the attention of the tradfi types.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-09 12:50:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hc7ygzx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pkr4fx","parent_id":"t1_hc7xisg","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/torfbolt","body":"That was cool, yes.

Perhaps this post is sour grapes to an extent. I don't think it is, but you be the judge.\n\nEvery period of 4 weeks, we get DYDX rewards based on fees and open interest. When I looked at the docs a couple weeks back, I was deterred by math formulas. In truth, I think they make it look much more complicated than it is.  You get tokens based on your paid fees (weighted 70%) and your open interest (weighted 30%), relative to the fees and OI of everyone else.\n\nBy the end of Epoch 0, to get 1 DYDX you needed to have paid $1 in fees and have about $100 of OI. This is part of the reason I expected $1 as a fair valuation for the token, roughly mapping out to subsidizing your fees. With $2-$3 as possible speculative value, and $5 as mania.\n\nInstead, we're seeing sustained $14... Meaning for every dollar people spent on fees last month, they get $14 worth of tokens! At these rates, you may as well open and close positions endlessly just to farm rewards. Or perhaps toying with a leveraged long on one address and a leveraged short on another address, to break even on your positions (I even asked about the viability of doing this in an earlier post. If only I went through with it!)\n\nOf course, this was the token launch. Maybe no metric applies then. \n\nRight now, one third through Epoch 1, you're projected to get 2 DYDX for 1 dollar of paid fees. But there's little chance this decreases linearly to a third - if the market is still willing to pay $15, or $10, or $5 per token by the end of this month, logically arbitrageurs should move in and make dummy trades just to farm rewards.\n\nThe only conclusion I have is that I know nothing.\n\nEdit: another thought. The dydx USDC liquidity staking pool gives 0.07 DYDX per grand per day right now. At $14 per token, this is 36% APY. Does this make sense? I can't see that rate holding for a straight stable staking pool from a top tier protocol. You'd expect something like yearn to move in.\n\nGranted, there's all kinds of restriction on unstaking. Got to initiate a withdraw at least 14 days before the end of an epoch. Given that epochs are 4 weeks long, this means you can't withdraw half of the time. Perhaps this is adequate risk for those rewards. Or perhaps we'll see a billion dollar worth of USDC in the staking pool by next month (currently 209M).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am more and more perplexed by the DYDX valuation.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I sold yesterday at $12 soon after release, and spent a ridiculous amount of gas to do so.
