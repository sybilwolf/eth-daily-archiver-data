Let's do a Weekly Markets Recap and see where we're at and what supports and targets we've got lined up for the rest of the month.\n\nnews:\n\n* Of course there was El Salvador. Anyone who didn't see this as a sell the news event sure does now. It was a massive red flag, considering the electorate didn't want it, the president  who rammed it through is a corrupt scumbag, and -- oh right -- the so-called Lightning Network doesn't work and never will, certainly not at a countrywide level.\n* European Central Bank did what the American Fed couldn't. They tapere-- wait. They didn't? Lagarde channeled Old Maggie and said without a doubt she is not tapering. No no no, not tapering, merely reducing the amount of bonds purchased by the EU bank. Not at all tapering, simply a gradual lessening of stimulus. No tapering, no sir, only a downward trending number of Euro spent on bailing out EU billionaires. Yes. Totally. /s So anyway, tapering is here. Europe went first. Papa Jerome has runaway inflation and a Delta surge tugging at him from both sides. The next FOMC meeting is Sept 22 and it could go either way.\n\ncrypto:\n\n* BTC broke down through most near- and mid-term supports I last mentioned. It's just closed below the 50 and 200 Day MAs and presently working to get back above the 50 which is now light resistance. Now, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this. BTC doesn't tend to go back below the 200 in bull market recovery bounces. This is rather unusual. Look for it to break and hold above the 200 @ 46k or so to start its repair. Otherwise, it's now more likely than ever that it retests the 20W MA at 43k or so, where it can often bounce. That's also the 100 Day MA which it can also bounce from. The 50 was never really intended to be a major support as there aren't many historical turnarounds there. But that also means it's not major resistance, so good for a potential recovery and repair.\n* ETH is all about the ratio for now. .07 and .068 are strong horizontal lines of support, though we're heading back downward into the channel below. It's expected this time of year but stings, I know, because of the raucous weeks we've had of late. $3k, 2800, and 2650 are key support levels.\n\nmarkets:\n\n* S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow all retraced this week in a 5-day mini-rout. In terms of what to track, the S&P, which hasn't had a correction over a year, is a good indicator. With a close at 4458, we're only down 2% from the high and a correction of 5-10% is expected before December so that's the bearish argument. But all eyes will be on 4420. That's where the 50 Day and 10 Week MAs both reside for the S&P. It has not closed a week below the 10W since before the bull run, back in 2020. Under 4420, the bears get a chance to play.\n* Small caps IWM (221.62) - The risk-on small caps gave up nearly all of their three weeks of gains, reversing to plunge back below the 10 and 20W MAs. Considering it was already ranging for months and bearishly so, this is not a good look. A close below 217 next week would create a lower high and could set up a rough autumn.\n* 10Y yields (1.342) - The flow of money to banking safeholds dropped as well, but stayed above the 10W MA at 1.1334. Financials caught a break in the form of this brake.\n* Bonds - TLH (150.72) and TLT (148.40) - Still divergence here as the TLT closed above its 50W MA, but the nearer timeframe TLH while also green stopped just short its 50. Of note is that both are in clear bull flags up to the Monthly scale. Worse is that both have their 10W MAs in striking distance of golden crossing above the 50W. The TLT is about 30 basis points away and the TLH approx. 100. The last time the 10W broke above the 50W? December 2018. Not a fun time in the markets.\n* Financials XLF (37.58) - Broke down beneath its 10W MA at 37.62. The next support is the 20W at 37.35.\n* Energy XLE (47.79) - Rejected off the 10W at 49.19. Next support is the Bollinger band / 50W near 45.55. Often cited as the confirmation of a bull cycle ending, the XLE sector rolling over is looking more and more certain as we go on. Doesn't mean the blow-off peak isn't still ahead, but it does mean headwinds for all.\n* Gold (1787) - Following its cryptobrethren, the yellow nugget reversed and crashed down through ever major support. The next support is a supply zone near 1760, unless it turns around on its own.\n* Volatility Index VIX (20.94) - For all of you who just gulped seeing that closing number, I feel you. The VIX as a measure of volatility naturally works in spikes. Big ones up and big ones down. The thing to note is that it closed above 20, a very key zone. It also closed above the upper Bollinger band, so it'll come back down. But 20 is a very sticky number, especially this time of year. September/October can have sustained weeks around 20, meaning tumultuous markets -- sometimes up! But usually down.\n* BTC Dominance - Last but not least is BTC's marketshare. It's at historic lows where it bounced before at the 2018 peak, the 2018 dead cat, and in May of this year. *Historically*, bounces would indicate either further drops as people flock to safety in BTC *or* a surging BTC as it begins an end of year rally. We don't know if it will bounce here. It could set a new low in the history of crypto (alt season) or one of the above may occur.\n\nWhew, long one. Personally, I'm not worried until BTC closes below 43k. That happens? Then we can talk some scary levels, namely a test of 39.5k and the fact that below 43k, a retest of 25k becomes a possibility once again on a macro scale. It's DCA season for this guy until then.\n\nCheers! QCCC?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Goodness, I logged on and one would think the world ended.

It's definitely going over 10k characters so here's a teaser:\n\nSince long before NFT's humans have been collecting silly things. We collect stamps, baseball cards, vinyl records, video games, art, and recently of course, NFT's. I can easily enough imagine some caveman collecting rocks; heck I've seen it from penguins. It's wired into us. We instinctually want to gather things, feel they belong to us, and gaze upon our dragon hoards in pride. We even do this for otherwise valueless things. Baseball cards do *nothing* but Topps has been running a business on them for decades. Because we're weird we even do this for purely digital collections.\n\nWe weave our collections into our very identities. Our collections become part of the story we tell about ourselves. You'll casually tell someone I'm an **'X'** collector at a cocktail party in the same way you'll tell them your occupation. How you personalize your collection of 'X' says something about you. This behavior create communities of people, subcultures that share a bond forged by the difficulty of the habit. Being part of this culture brings trust, community, recognition, and status.\n\nPeople will go to extreme lengths to finish a collection. They'll spend thousands of dollars on Magic cards that they'll never play with. They'll spend hundreds of hours filling some 100% number in a video game, collecting Korok seeds [^yahaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PWqt2Wg-us&amp;ab_channel=CokeWolve), getting every steam achievement, or gathering some aesthetic set. They'll login to zapper every day for months to sign a message and spend hard earned ETH on gas jumping through hoops just to get an image of a little Zappy dog. I don't have to be able to explain this. I can state to you with confidence that if you put a collectable in front of people it *drives behavior*. As soon as it becomes a defined collection, it becomes desirable. We take pride in showing our collection to others; it confers *status*. It invokes *memetic desire*. It is an *achievement*. The more difficult it is to attain, the stronger the memetic desire, the higher the status, the stronger the behavioral drive. Collector psychology is a deeply human, deeply emotional drive.\n\nThis drive can be utilized by designers. For good or ill it can be gamified. Collections can create objectives that incentivize people try a spectrum of behaviors rather than specialize. They can encourage us to overcome our fear of the unknown and step out onto unproven ground. Steam achievements add replayability to games, serendipitous discovery of features, add style and humor, and ultimately add tremendous value per developer hour invested in them. Compared to monetary incentives of the liquidity mining variety collectables drive an incredible amount of engagement per dollar invested. How much would Zapper have had to pay people to get the tens of thousands of users they got in their first quest round? How much would Alchemix have had to pay people in ALCX to get them to return the same amount of ETH from the red carpet exploit? Our collections can be both more personal and more egalitarian than money.\n\nMore tomorrow where I'll talk about how this phenomenon is unfolding today and how we can repurpose this drive for a better ecosystem and a better world.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m working on a blog post.
