Solana went down twice within a year. Ethereum had quite a few hiccups where some services relying on a specific client software became unresponsive for a prolonged time, but the ETH consensus layer always worked even through problems with individual clients. This shows that client diversity can prevent total outages.\n\nA potential problem we have at the moment is the clear dominance of some node client implementations on ethereum and also the beacon chain. On the ethereum chain it is geth which dominates and on the beacon chain it is prysm. Don't get me wrong, these are great pieces of software. There is nothing wrong with them. The problem arises from their dominance on the specific chain. On the beacon chain prysm has a dominance of about 2/3 which means if there is a bug in prysm the beacon chain would just stop (in my limited understanding at least). And thanks to the discussions around the solana outage I realised how difficult it is to restart a whole defi ecosystem after a long time. Loans might have become heavily undercollateralized, oracles might still deliver stale prices etc. Therefore, a restart might become quite ugly and quite costly for the whole ecosystem. \n\nSo, if you run your own nodes (and if you don't, you should), use one of the not so popular ones like nethermind, besu or erigon. If you run a validator please consider switching to either lighthouse, teku or nimbus. I know a switch is scary especially with so much money locked up in a single validator. I run lighthouse and geth on my validating machine and incidentally just bought a new machine a few days ago where now nimbus and erigon are syncing. I will test things out for a few weeks and see if I will switch the validator over to this new machine just to support diversity. But I will definitely use the erigon client as a backup for the geth client in case of problems on the ethereum network due to a geth bug.\n\nRunning a full ethereum node is not that costly, you can run it on a PC which is a few years old (my intel NUC is from 2018 and it is more than enough). You need an SSD with about 1 TB of space and an unmetered internet connection which has a speed of more than a few Mbs per second. My setup cost me about 450 dollars and I am sure it can be had cheaper.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>My takeaway from the whole solana debacle is: we need client diversity.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum never went down like solana (I am happy to be corrected here).

If we want to build a Sybil resistance platform we're either doing KYC which is basically an authority based attestation of identity, some sort of decentralized social attestation system like BrightID, or we're using address history. That's literally all we have to work with. I take it you guys don't like KYC.\n\nThere have been projects that started on this concept but just didn't carry it forward. If you haven't heard of [DefiDegen](https://degenscore.com) they scan blockchain indexes for address history, assign points to a subset of interesting events, and do an aggregation of the result into a single value. The process is centralized, the points are opinionated by them rather than whomever might consume this information, and the result isn't on-chain so it's limited in usefulness outside of putting it on your resume or bragging to your friends. [RabbitHole](http://rabbithole.gg) has similar downsides, though they do have on-chain NFT's. So what exactly would need to be built to enable our Sybil resistance platform?\n\nZooming in on the address history option above, Solidity does not allow you to reference previous state in contracts and obviously it's not feasible to duplicate Alchemy API or Subgraphs on-chain. However, there is a much denser form of on-chain history that we are already building in a decentralized way: gamified behavior-incentivizing NFT's. I write about this in my [previous post](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-future-gamification-of-nfts). I make the case there that we're going to see a lot more of these. They are a more economically efficient mechanism for incentivizing behavior than the liquidity mining incentives we've grown accustomed to, especially for things where you want a more egalitarian distribution such as governance participation, early adopter rewards, rewarding charitable behavior, etc. These NFT's, while created for selfish reasons by each platform to encourage participation, represent an attestation that I believe we can use to assemble a selfless, decentralized, public good that helps to solve the Sybil resistance problem.\n\nThese NFT's are restricted in supply by prerequisite action; usually, but not always, by address history. If an NFT can only be minted if certain conditions are met from address history, then NFT origin *is* an oracle of the address history. The original address serves as a *proxy* of a longer form calculation that is done off-chain which led a platform to authorize you to mint it. It is an *attestation* of something by that platform. I believe a lot more of these NFT's are on the way, and they are being built in a decentralized way by each individual platform for their own selfish reasons. The opportunity here is bountiful; there is just one problem: the NFT's themselves can be sold and their original address is not stored.\n\nAs an aside, I'd like to note the paradoxical nature of being able to trade NFTs that are meant to commemorate your personal achievements. There is absolutely something different about a collectable that was personally acquired by the investment of your time versus a collectable that was acquired with money that was earned by an investment of the same time. It's strange to me that some of these have a decent price floor.

All you need is a contract containing a mapping(attestationId => address) and some metadata about the significance of the attestation that callers can use to build their own opinionated version of a background check.

The reason for this is simply that there are so many different pools, and querying the state of them all to be absolutely positive you find the best route is not possible to do fast enough (i.e., users don't want to wait 60s or more to find the best price). \n\nI haven't looked into it in a high degree of detail and don't fully know how routes are chosen, but my guess would be that the routing would find your route automatically (if it was optimal) since the pools are with majors. That is to say since USDC and Eth are typically the biggest pairings for any token I would assume there would be some weighting towards routing with them.\n\nSidenote--if you enter the pair you want to trade and hover over the little [\"i\" in the bottom right corner of Uniswap's widget](https://i.imgur.com/cB2t4vu.png), you can see the route it selected.
