The earliest adopters of bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, used it to buy drugs, while cyber-hackers now demand their ransom in it. Hundreds of millions of dollars of ether, another digital money, were stolen this year after hackers found a bug in some code. Many \u201cbelievers\u201d are in reality trying to get rich quick from the global mania that has seen the value of cryptoassets reach $2.2trn. Others are freakishly devoted. The entrepreneur who announced in June that El Salvador was adopting bitcoin as an official currency sobbed on stage, claiming it would save the nation.\n\nThe crooks, fools and proselytisers are off-putting. Nevertheless, the rise of an ecosystem of financial services, known as decentralised finance, or \u201cDeFi\u201d, deserves sober consideration. It has the potential to rewire how the financial system works, with all the promise and perils that entails. The proliferation of innovation in DeFi is akin to the frenzy of invention in the early phase of the web. At a time when people live ever more of their lives online, the crypto-revolution could even remake the architecture of the digital economy.\n\nDeFi is one of three tech trends disrupting finance. Tech \u201cplatform\u201d firms are muscling in on payments and banks. Governments are launching digital currencies, or govcoins. DeFi offers an alternative path which aims to spread power, not concentrate it. To understand how, start with blockchains, vast networks of computers that keep an open, incorruptible common record and update it without the need for a central authority.\n\nBitcoin, the first big blockchain, created in 2009, is now a distraction. Instead, Ethereum, a blockchain network created in 2015, upon which most DeFi applications are built, is reaching critical mass. Its developers view finance as a juicy target. Conventional banking requires a huge infrastructure to maintain trust between strangers, from clearing houses and compliance to capital rules and courts. It is expensive and often captured by insiders: think of credit-card fees and bankers\u2019 yachts. By contrast, transactions on a blockchain are trustworthy, cheap, transparent and quick\u2014at least in theory.\n\nAlthough the terminology is intimidating (fees are \u201cgas\u201d; the main currency is ether, and title deeds over digital assets are known as NFTs), the basic activities taking place on DeFi are familiar. These include trading on exchanges and issuing loans and taking deposits through self-executing agreements called smart contracts. One yardstick of activity is the value of digital instruments being used as collateral: from almost nothing in early 2018 it has reached $90bn. Another is the value of transactions that Ethereum is verifying. In the second quarter this reached $2.5trn, around the same sum as Visa processes and equivalent to a sixth of the activity on Nasdaq, a stock exchange.\n\nThe dream of a low-friction financial system is just the beginning.

But it stands to transform how money works and, as it does so, the entire digital world.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>THE SCEPTICS have plenty of fodder. The earliest adopters of bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, used it to buy drugs, while cyber-hackers now demand their ransom in it. Hundreds of millions of dollars of ether, another digital money, were stolen this year after hackers found a bug in some code. Many \u201cbelievers\u201d are in reality trying to get rich quick from the global mania that has seen the value of cryptoassets reach $2.2trn. Others are freakishly devoted. The entrepreneur who announced in June that El Salvador was adopting bitcoin as an official currency sobbed on stage, claiming it would save the nation.</p>\n\n<p>The crooks, fools and proselytisers are off-putting. Nevertheless, the rise of an ecosystem of financial services, known as decentralised finance, or \u201cDeFi\u201d, deserves sober consideration. It has the potential to rewire how the financial system works, with all the promise and perils that entails. The proliferation of innovation in DeFi is akin to the frenzy of invention in the early phase of the web. At a time when people live ever more of their lives online, the crypto-revolution could even remake the architecture of the digital economy.</p>\n\n<p>DeFi is one of three tech trends disrupting finance. Tech \u201cplatform\u201d firms are muscling in on payments and banks. Governments are launching digital currencies, or govcoins. DeFi offers an alternative path which aims to spread power, not concentrate it. To understand how, start with blockchains, vast networks of computers that keep an open, incorruptible common record and update it without the need for a central authority.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin, the first big blockchain, created in 2009, is now a distraction. Instead, Ethereum, a blockchain network created in 2015, upon which most DeFi applications are built, is reaching critical mass. Its developers view finance as a juicy target. Conventional banking requires a huge infrastructure to maintain trust between strangers, from clearing houses and compliance to capital rules and courts. It is expensive and often captured by insiders: think of credit-card fees and bankers\u2019 yachts. By contrast, transactions on a blockchain are trustworthy, cheap, transparent and quick\u2014at least in theory.</p>\n\n<p>Although the terminology is intimidating (fees are \u201cgas\u201d; the main currency is ether, and title deeds over digital assets are known as NFTs), the basic activities taking place on DeFi are familiar. These include trading on exchanges and issuing loans and taking deposits through self-executing agreements called smart contracts. One yardstick of activity is the value of digital instruments being used as collateral: from almost nothing in early 2018 it has reached $90bn. Another is the value of transactions that Ethereum is verifying. In the second quarter this reached $2.5trn, around the same sum as Visa processes and equivalent to a sixth of the activity on Nasdaq, a stock exchange.</p>\n\n<p>The dream of a low-friction financial system is just the beginning.

This would represent roughly a \\~100x from now, broken down into a 10x of the base trading pair (ETH => $20k!), and a 10x+ ratio gain.\n\n* Rocket Pool has strong credible neutrality, is open source and more purely decentralized, and aligns with the Ethereum ethos. I think it will be at least as large as Lido in terms of size of market share.\n* It's a win-win for users and node operators, and will provide a strong economic incentive vs. holding ETH in DeFi or solo staking. NOs will earn a higher yield, and users will be able to stack staking yield + DeFi yield (assuming rETH is adopted in DeFi).\n* Staking will take off post-merge as yields go through the roof, ultimately trending towards \\~50% ETH staked over time.\n* RPL will capture 20% of the market (\\~10m ETH) over the long term.\n* RPL collateralization will be \\*super\\* high, since node operators can't withdraw until the collateral is >150% of the validator value.

However, what I haven&#39;t done, (partly put of fear) is check what the price in ETH typically looks like. I suspect ETH&#39;s growth may have outstripped that of airdrops.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, my baseline after getting a half dozen (maybe more?) drops, i tend to ride through the initial chop, sell some, and hold some. If it&#39;s a project i care about, i hold it because I like to vote. If not, i will speculate a little. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, always remember to set aside a third+ of any sold airdrop gains for potential tax liability. I throw that into a stablecoin vault and let it earn until it&#39;s tax seaspn.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m still not sure that selling into ETH isn&#39;t generally the best play, however.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-16 07:04:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hd2vyst","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pp6t1h","parent_id":"t1_hd2t3an","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Oh yeah I completely forgot about taxes.
