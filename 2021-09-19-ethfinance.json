Next installment of my NFT thoughts.\n\nSo, let's say we want to build the attestation struct I mentioned before. What would it take to convince you this is feasible? The technical feasibility of an attestation struct shouldn't be a point of contention. It just requires some entity tables, some many to many mappings, and some permissions, nothing extraordinary. Rather, to convince you this is feasible I need to convince you of a few economic and political points:\n\n* The attestation struct is economical to build and maintain.\n\n* DAO's can be persuaded to fund this public good for their own selfish ends.\n\n* Long tail revenue can be built to maintain the infrastructure.\n\nBasically, if we can identify people who benefit enough to pay for it then it's feasible right?\n\nLet's start by having a look at contract complexity. In terms of gas, the complexity is less than an ERC-20 transfer. ERC-20 transfers minimally have some require statements that check that you aren't overdrawing the amount you have or your allowance and then update a mapping(address -> uint32) with a new value with yet more math. By contrast, updating our attestation struct needs to check the calling address for permission on that attestation, lookup an address set in the map, and append an address to it. This becomes a little more economical if it's batched because the require statement and lookup only happen once. So on average, the gas is slightly higher than an ETH send but less than your average ERC-20. If we have a look at various [L2 fees](https://l2fees.info) that puts us in the $0.1 to $0.25 range per attestation. As to which L2, the only requirement is that other contracts can reference this contract for the data; that's the public good part. I actually don't know how an L1 contract calls a view function on a contract within the OVM for example, but the data is all on chain so I don't see why it wouldn't be possible.\n\nThere's some wiggle room in how this is done depending on who is paying the fee. If users are paying the fee then the permission for the attestation has to be a parameter to the function call and has to be verified on-chain which pushes the price up. I'm not convinced that's viable unless the system is just so fun to use and becomes adopted by enough other Defi Legos that people actively spend gas to forge their identity. I think there will be much higher engagement/adoption if the gas is paid for POAP style. The downside of course is the attestation contract has to get the ETH to pay for gas somehow. So let's talk about how we might go about that.\n\nRemember those gamified NFT's? They create engagement for DAO's. Therefore DAO's should be willing to pay something for it. Is a $0.1-$.25 user acquisition expense reasonable for DAOs? I think compared to liquidity mining that's quite a discount. Right now, those who are building gamified NFT's are spending developer hours to build their own system. Each DAO is making their own ad-hoc implementation. They have to find their own artists, write their own NFT contracts, and write their own permission system for minting the NFT's. Sometimes the permission is as simple as shoving a CSV of eligible addresses into the NFT mint contract. That only works retroactively. Other times the conditions are far more complicated. Either way there is a permission system and it's a lot of common work that could be provided as a service by a platform. If we can standardize the permission system for minting the NFT's to be the attestation struct then we can basically fund this entire thing by leveraging the gamified NFTs DAOs are creating. In addition to just saving developer hours for each DAO this also increases discoverability for their NFT's. It's easy marketing. A common platform could provide a spread of artist options for some peer to peer matching of gig-work, navigation and search functionality of all these behavior incentivizing NFT's and the platforms that made them, and provide a standard mechanism for permission enabled NFT's while also building this public good as a side effect. Is a $0.1-$.25 expense per attestation a reasonable tradeoff for these benefits? It's a matter of opinion but I hope so.\n\nSo, assuming the DAO's can pay for the dev work for the art and the alchemy API/subgraph queries which are the basis for the attestation, how do we pay for the gas and long term infrastructure such as the backend and website hosting? Well, the initial gas will come from the dev funds. Beyond that, my suggestion would be UMA KPI's. If the benefit to the DAO is engagement, create engagement targets with tiered bonuses. Obviously this also opens an avenue to reward platform evangalists who market this platform and encourage people to try it. I can also see a good case being made for Gitcoin grants to fund the gas due to the public good aspect. Lastly, I think there is a fair and humble revenue stream from taking sale proceeds of the NFT's. These can be split with the DAO associated with the NFT.\n\nNext up I'll be talking about the metadata associated with the attestation structure and how it could be used to audit the honesty of the attestation.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pojhe2/daily_general_discussion_september_15_2021/hcx14x5/\">Previous post</a>.
