Both [BTC spot prices](https://i.imgur.com/kUI6AWz.png) and [the ETH/BTC ratio](https://i.imgur.com/7BrxbMT.png) are testing a four-month trendline that could define the rest of this cycle.\n\n* BTC closed yesterday at 40,750. Well below the 200 Day EMA at 41.8k. Below the 100D SMA at 40,775. It came to rest on the 20 Week SMA at \\~40,700. Now, that close may not matter until Sunday with the weekly close. But watch because if multiple smaller timeframes start consistently closing below the 20W, it could spell danger. Supports at the daily level are a supply zone at 39.5k and the relatively weak 23.6 fib line at 37.7k.\n* ETH - I may be accumulating ETH, but I do so based on BTC levels. See above trend line for ratio supports.\n\ntraditional markets\n\n* S&P500 (4354) - using this as a proxy for all indices to shorten this\n   * Ended today around the 20W MA (4347)\n   * But the real things to watch are 100 Day (4320) and 200D (4110) MAs. A close below 4320, which they've already tested once on Monday, would invite a test of the July low at 4250ish.\n   * And by watch, I do mean watch if you're a trader. Most likely is that we see an upward retest of 4380, the August low, and maybe even a possible spike back to previous Sept 17 low at 4410. It'd be a classic bull trap by way of filling the gap (remember those?) caused by the weekend-into-Monday trade.\n   *  But one possibility is that tonight's futures could actually have a little more weight than they usually do. That's because if they, for some reason, go WAY WAY I'm talking WAAAAAAAAY down after hours, then the market could open for real substantially lower in what's called a gap, completely skipping the aforementioned \"test\" of 4320 and heading straight for 4250. That'd be bearish and a common trick pulled by Wall Street.\n   * A reason for that scenario is the enormous number of puts at the 4300 level. Without a gap through, it will be VERY difficult (but not impossible) to sell through 4300 in a session prior to this week's Friday expiry. Next week is a different story, but for now there is a pretty gigantic put wall at 4300.\n   * While we're two days now way outside the lower Bollinger band (4378), it is still magnetic and until it widens will also hug the market closer. Of course, further days below it and the Bband will expand downward, allowing for further sells.\n   * In summation: 4380 (potentially upward to 4410) - 4345 - 4320 - 4250 - 4160 - 4110. These are the levels to watch this week, the latter ones only in case of emergency.\n* Dollar DXY (93.25) - tested and bounced strongly once off 93. Very bullish coming out of its daily-sized ascending wedge and weekly-sized double bottom. Bearish for crypto and equities.\n* BTC Dominance (42.46) - It's the time of year when BTC rattles back, usually in a dip followed by a blast-off leaving ETH and alts behind. It's forming a textbook double bottom on the weekly but needs to clear the prior September wick at 43.60 to really soar.\n* VIX Volatility (24.35) - Day 2 in a row above the upper Bband (23.79). Face ripping price drops and surges are still in the air. This needs to head back down to Earth around 20 and break through to let markets breathe again.\n* FTSE (UK market) has opened a little down but will probably stay put until the US wakes up.\n\nQCCC?\n\nCheers!\n\nStay safe.
