I realize that now. I'm almost positive there's nothing I can do to get it back.\n\nHere's a video showing the steps I went through when I made the original deposit. https://youtu.be/lm5NxFt58SU\n\nJust to go through the steps, since I probably didn't communicate clearly earlier:\n\n* I connected my metamask to oasis.app with metamask set to Ethereum Mainnet, same as I've done probably dozens of times. \n\n* In Metamask, I switched from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum, same way I've done on Impermax, Sushiswap, etc.\n\n* Just like on Impermax, Sushiswap, and other projects, when I switched Metamask to Arbitrum, oasis.app showed my ETH balance on Arbitrum. At the time, that balance was a little over 63.56 ETH.\n\n* Seeing my Arbitrum balance, and hearing that DAI was now available on Arbitrum, I thought vaults were now available on Arbitrum as well\n\n* I deposited 63 ETH and clicked confirm. I should have sent a test transaction, however after using my vault without problems for years, I didn't think to do so.\n\n* Now that ETH is gone. \n\nNote, in the video, that when I switch between networks in Metamask, the amount of ETH available to deposit in oasis.app changes. On Mainnet, I now have a little over .54 ETH. On Arbitrum, after losing my 63 ETH, I now have a little over .56. I'm pointing it out because there's only a .02 difference between the numbers, so I want to make sure you guys don't miss it. \n\nIf you're reading this and you have a Maker vault, DO NOT SWITCH TO ARBITRUM AND TRY TO DEPOSIT. It will allow you to do so, but you will lose your ETH. \n\nThis was literally everything I had in the world besides my car. I'm not posting for sympathy, I just want everyone to know so it doesn't happen to them, and because I said I'd keep everyone updated. I know I'm the one who made the transaction. I take responsibility for that. But I do think, if Maker doesn't support vaults on Arbitrum, they should disable deposits if your wallet is set to Arbitrum. That's what projects like Impermax, Sushiswap, and even ArbiNYAN do.\n\nedit 2: Since it was requested, here's the link to my post on the makerdao forums \nhttps://forum.makerdao.com/t/i-think-i-lost-all-my-eth-on-oasis-app/10446","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, just posting again to update and clarify my post from earlier: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pt0de0/daily_general_discussion_september_22_2021/hdvivlq/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pt0de0/daily_general_discussion_september_22_2021/hdvivlq/</a></p>\n\n<p>So far, the only thing I&#39;ve heard from the Maker team is that they&#39;ll talk to the team but that vaults are only available on mainnet.
