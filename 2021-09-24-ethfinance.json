A 1 million dollar prize would be a psychological number we believe will promote a virtuous cycle or snowball effect of growth. A lottery with 50k of prizes? Ok cool but i wanna be a millionaire!\n\nCurrently, growth is constrained by low chances to win and fragmented prizes. To hit the 1 million meme number, we need larger prizes and more chances to win. There are lots of lottery tools in DeFi. But PoolTogether is unique in that if focusses on prizes. Not yield farming. Yield farming is great and PT has that too, but the real value add is the prizes.\n\n**How does v3 work currently?**\n\nThe more people join the pool and the larger the total deposit pool in relation to your own deposits, the odds of winning gets less and less. A common and fair criticism of PoolTogether is that only whales win.\n\n**Ok, so why is v4 better? Codename** ***'Tsunami'***\n\n* *Chances to win* \\- In v4, as prizes get bigger, there can be *more* chances to win. The protocol can scale the number of prizes along with the size of the pool.\n* *Combining Pool liquidity* \\- Prize fragmentation is fixed by combining the liquidity of pools on all seperate chains into one big prize. i.e the pool depositors on Polygon will have access to the prize pool interest accrued by the users on Arbitrum. This is how we get huge prizes. We dont fragment pool liquidity. We aggregate it! This is probably the single most powerful feature of v4 imho.\n* *Different prize sizes* \\- The prizes dont have to be split equally. We can have a huge prize, but we can still split the pot further into hundreds or thousands of little prizes. $10 here, $50 there, but LOTS of them. Your chance of winning the big prize may still be small, but your chance of winning a small prize is much greater. In effect, you can also see this as an effective invisible 'APR boost' on your savings account. Yes there is POOL yield, but also that chance of winning a small (or big!) prize.\n* No early exit fees! A nice benefit of the design is that the protocol can do away with charging exit fees for depositors.\n* Prizes are pull instead of push, which they are in v3. A transaction will be called by the user to claim their winnings on the specific chain in which they initially deposited. This is less of a problem now with L2s and into the future where scaling will make individual transactions less of a front-of-mind consideration from users.\n* Lower gas costs in general.\n\n**The rollout**\n\nPoolTogether v3 will continue to operate as normal and the current site will still operate under the v3 contracts. There is no requirement to move funds or migrate if users dont want to.\n\nOn October 13th, there will be a seperate website release to interact with the new v4 contracts. Initially v4 will launch on Polygon and Ethereum on USDC only, with the combined pool liquidity feature of v4 enabled, but the team have ambitions to launch on every EVM compatible chain and all of the pools with all of the tokens.\n\nAt a point in the future, the v3 and v4 sites will eventually integrate.\n\nCheers, everybody!

I think the very first time was like 2013 or 2014. </p>\n\n<p>I mean even the US government doesn&#39;t like crypto because it can&#39;t control it - that goes 100x for the Chinese, so the reason isn&#39;t hard to see. </p>\n\n<p>So yes, they are moving more and more towards crypto restrictions and the last big step before this was in May. </p>\n\n<p>The point is more that it doesn&#39;t really matter in the long term for crypto&#39;s future. Crypto has survived every China FUD or China anti-crypto measure till now, and will survive this one just fine except for the short term fluctuations. </p>\n\n<p>Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong but I think I read that Bitcoin hash rates have fully or almost fully recovered since the May mining ban by China. </p>\n\n<p>As pointed out elsewhere, Google, YouTube, Twitter etc are also banned in China and they do just fine. </p>\n\n<p>In 2017 when I first got into crypto I was still worried a bit about governments completely crushing crypto, but even by 2017 it was probably too late to completely destroy it. Now it definitely is.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-24 10:22:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"he44su6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_puct3u","parent_id":"t1_he3s010","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/o-_l_-o","body":"Let me help the conspiracies: China specifically called out Tether in the announcement because they know Tether is 100% backed by Evergrande CP and want to protect its citizens from putting their money into a failing asset (that isn\u2019t the yuan).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Let me help the conspiracies: China specifically called out Tether in the announcement because they know Tether is 100% backed by Evergrande CP and want to protect its citizens from putting their money into a failing asset (that isn\u2019t the yuan).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-24 05:49:54","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-09-24 06:01:06","id":"he331cx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_puct3u","parent_id":"t3_puct3u","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"Lol","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Lol</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-24 06:42:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"he39ihs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_puct3u","parent_id":"t1_he331cx","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/accountaccumulator","body":"Do you have a link to the announcement?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Do you have a link to the announcement?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-24 06:00:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"he349ev","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_puct3u","parent_id":"t1_he331cx","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/theezeroproof","body":"It's a joke","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s a joke</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-24 08:46:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"he3qy2g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_puct3u","parent_id":"t1_he349ev","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"The fuck was that is there some new fud","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The fuck was that is there some new fud</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-24 18:30:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"he601tp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_puct3u","parent_id":"t3_puct3u","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Eth_head_0","body":"Not new FUD, just the same old China FUD from earlier this year getting a fresh new coat of paint so someone can pick up some cheap coins.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Not new FUD, just the same old China FUD from earlier this year getting a fresh new coat of paint so someone can pick up some cheap coins.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-24 20:21:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"he6e135","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_puct3u","parent_id":"t1_he601tp","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/sgad89","body":"Don't care about price until new ATHs.
