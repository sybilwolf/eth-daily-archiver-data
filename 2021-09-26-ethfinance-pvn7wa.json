SEC and CFTC will issue their opinion for each of the top tokens by market cap and then open up for public comment before making a final ruling.\n* Title II (Digital Asset Trade Repositories): If a trade doesn\u2019t execute in 24 hours, it needs to be sent to a CFTC-registered \u201cdigital asset trade repository\u201d. These are the crypto equivalent of \u201cswap data repositories\u201d, which, as a non-finance person, seem to me like derivative clearinghouses. \n* Title III (Stablecoins): Fed-issued CDBC coming. Whether there will be other private options is up to the Treasury Department, which will publish a process for requesting approval.\n* Title IV (Anti-Money Laundering): Everything that Americans can access needs to be KYC\u2019d. Treasury will issue rules on anonymizing services, but those aren\u2019t outlined in the bill.\n* Title V (Reports to Congress): Sometime in late 2022, Congress is going to get a bunch of reports explaining how crypto works from various agencies. This includes reports on: (1) tax evasion, (2) ransomware, (3) DeFi, (4) digital asset custodians, (5) digital asset trading platforms, and (6) false trade reporting, wash trading, and off-chain transactions. These reports will come with legislative/regulatory suggestions which the relevant committees can then act on. \n\n  \nMy high level commentary:\n\n* **Most tokens will be securities.** Based on the language of the bill, I think the vast majority of tokens will be considered securities, except for L1s own native token on sufficiently decentralized networks. Bitcoin and Ethereum are explicitly called out, but there may also be a handful of others. \n* **Our current financial system, but digital!** Congress seems to be providing guardrails modeled on the current financial system and kicking the can for more regulation down the road. \n* **What about NFTs and gaming/art/social tokens?** Unsurprisingly there are gaps on where other (arguably semi-financial) digital assets, such as gaming, art, and social tokens fit in. They seem to be focusing on big $ ERC-20s and capital-F DeFi platforms, which will probably invite some regulatory arbitrage until we see further clarification. Although if OpenSea ends up being in the top 10 exchanges by trading volume, we may see recommendations on how to treat NFTs come down in 2022.\n* **Stablecoins.** If Treasury doesn\u2019t approve any, companies will likely be forced to go the securities route if they want to have such offerings. \n* **Anti-money laundering.** There isn\u2019t a comprehensive plan for anti-money laundering in this bill, but if I had to guess, the likely outcome is that Treasury will ask custodians to flag any US citizen account with >$X transaction or >$Y per year coming from non-KYC\u2019d accounts (or via tumblers, zk transactions, etc.) for AML review.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr4741/text\">H.R. 4741</a> summary (Disclaimer: IANAL)</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a lot in here, so I\u2019ll be putting detailed section-by-section notes below in sub-comments.

Get a hardware wallet / sync with MetaMask.  Lately this has been a pain in the ass with Ledger.  I bought a lattice1 GridPlus and it's proven to be well worth the extra expense. \n\n2. Check out tools like Zapper and Defi Saver.  I use Zapper every day and can't imagine life without it.\n\n2. Understand the key DeFi primitives borrowing/lending/staking/providing liquidity/farming\n\nUnderstand how to use a borrowing protocol like Aave or Maker.  This is important for a number of reasons, but mainly you are long ETH want to hold it since you're expecting price appreciation relative to stable coins.  Therefore you want to deposit ETH as collateral and borrow stable coins.  Then you can trade these stable coins for whatever tokens you need for staking/providing liquidity/farming.  Now your debt is denominated in dollars while your underlying collateral is denominated in ETH. Before you do this, you must have a firm understanding of interest accrual and most importantly liquidation. I won't go into all of the details, but if you have questions about this, you can dm me.\n\nNext, I would recommend learning the basics of providing liquidity.  An important concept to understand here is impermanent loss.  If you want to provide liquidity, then understanding this is pretty much non-negotiable.  Other than that, you just need to understand the basic mechanics of fee generation.  Basically you earn a fixed percentage of every swap made in a given pool ( 0.25% is very common for non-stable coin pairs ) times your percentage share of the pool. Generally you want pools with lots of volume relative to the total liquidity.  Stay away from pools with garbage tokens, ultra low tvl, or low volume.  Uniswap V3 is more complicated, so it might not be the best place to start. It does however provide a ton of upside, specifically related to capitol efficiency.  Then means greater fee generation through less liquidity, but also poses impermanent loss on steriods.\n\nI think most farming strategies involve first providing liquidity, then depositing that LP token into a farm to earn additional rewards generally paid out through governance tokens such as SUSHI, ALCX, CRV, CVX, etc.\n\nStaking is very straight forward of course, so I won't go into that.\n\nI think I started with Yearn because it is quite simple and does a lot of work behind the scenes for you such as auto-compounding rewards.  This might actually be a decent choice if you plan on starting on Ethereum mainnet, since every transaction will cost a ton of gas.\n\nSpeaking of gas, you might be interested in starting out with Optimism or Arbitrum instead.  These L2's are still in beta, so there are far less opportunities compared to L1, but we all expect this is change over the next several months.\n\nThere is so much more here to talk about, but I think the best way to learn is hands on. I think most of the risks are pretty common sense, but that's not always the case, so make sure to reach out and ask around if something comes up where you aren't sure.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think I might have some decent resources saved.

Basically Saddle pool with ETH/alETH/sETH earning something like 21% in ALCX essentially risk off, and then staking the ALCX rewards for 100% APR. Then I got greedy and took out a Maker loan to straight up stake ALCX. This was risky, but paid off nicely as I closed out the position and paid off the loan after ALCX returned to a local high around $400. Was able to earn something like 8 ETH just from that. I have long been a fan of Alchemix, so the idea of holding ALCX for a longer run never really bothered me. \n\nNext I took out an Aave loan for USDC and used half to buy ETH.

Now, the only reason to reposition would be to catch fees again, but it would take some time to compensate for the losses.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-26 00:19:58","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-09-26 04:07:37","id":"hebjpyv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pvn7wa","parent_id":"t3_pvn7wa","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/usswsbregrets","body":"Anyone else experiencing whiplash?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Anyone else experiencing whiplash?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-26 02:52:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hebuqho","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pvn7wa","parent_id":"t3_pvn7wa","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/blewoutmyshorts","body":"Naughty","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Naughty</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-26 04:29:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hec24e1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pvn7wa","parent_id":"t3_pvn7wa","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Gr3mlins","body":"Is there anyway I can see how much FARM I have vested, I had my ETH in there for a while","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is there anyway I can see how much FARM I have vested, I had my ETH in there for a while</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-26 20:36:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hefkxt4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pvn7wa","parent_id":"t3_pvn7wa","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/laninsterJr","body":"Who approved this rehearsal ant pump?\ud83e\udd14","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Who approved this rehearsal ant pump?\ud83e\udd14</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-26 21:48:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hefroun","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pvn7wa","parent_id":"t3_pvn7wa","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"Another shot at 39.5k / 2650...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Another shot at 39.5k / 2650...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-26 00:52:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hebm6xu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pvn7wa","parent_id":"t3_pvn7wa","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/InelukiStormKing","body":"Right again, man.
