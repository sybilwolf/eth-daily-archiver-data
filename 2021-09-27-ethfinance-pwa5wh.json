[Here's](https://imgur.com/mc7HrX2) a silly paint.exe illustration I did to explain the relations.\n\nA [DSProxy](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-proxy) is a smart contract that is created and owned by your EOA (your account that you have loaded up in your MetaMask or Ledger or whichever wallet interface) and your DSProxy then holds any number of Maker Vaults on it. Effectively, it's being used as a smart contract wallet, with your EOA being the only owner and manager.\n\nThe DSProxy was first popularised [by MakerDAO](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/devtools/working-with-dsproxy/working-with-dsproxy.md) and later adopted by other major protocols such as Balancer and Reflexer, but also by us at DeFi Saver, where we use it to keep positions in any number of integrated protocols. Note that your one DSProxy holds all of those positions.\n\nBut the cool thing about the DSProxy is that it also enables additional authorisations to be made on it, which is how DFS Automation is made possible. The smart contracts [audit](https://medium.com/defi-saver/defi-saver-automation-security-audit-summary-a883d4fde1b) briefly explains it.\n\nFinally, to answer your question about transactions showing up on Etherscan - you'll need to switch to the \"Internal Txns\" tab and also turn on \"Advanced view\" so all transactions executed through your DSProxy show up. Here's one random example illustrating where you will find those: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x251c36771e862d77651ae47cac5ce6d425610576/advanced#internaltx](https://etherscan.io/address/0x251c36771e862d77651ae47cac5ce6d425610576/advanced#internaltx)\n\nAlternatively, you can also find the list of all (manual and automated) adjustments made to Maker vaults using [https://defiexplore.com/](https://defiexplore.com/). There's also a CSV export option at the bottom of any CDP's history page there.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>As I understand it each CDP has a DSProxy linked to it</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s actually the other way around. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/mc7HrX2\">Here&#39;s</a> a silly paint.exe illustration I did to explain the relations.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://github.com/dapphub/ds-proxy\">DSProxy</a> is a smart contract that is created and owned by your EOA (your account that you have loaded up in your MetaMask or Ledger or whichever wallet interface) and your DSProxy then holds any number of Maker Vaults on it. Effectively, it&#39;s being used as a smart contract wallet, with your EOA being the only owner and manager.</p>\n\n<p>The DSProxy was first popularised <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/devtools/working-with-dsproxy/working-with-dsproxy.md\">by MakerDAO</a> and later adopted by other major protocols such as Balancer and Reflexer, but also by us at DeFi Saver, where we use it to keep positions in any number of integrated protocols. Note that your one DSProxy holds all of those positions.</p>\n\n<p>But the cool thing about the DSProxy is that it also enables additional authorisations to be made on it, which is how DFS Automation is made possible. The smart contracts <a href=\"https://medium.com/defi-saver/defi-saver-automation-security-audit-summary-a883d4fde1b\">audit</a> briefly explains it.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, to answer your question about transactions showing up on Etherscan - you&#39;ll need to switch to the &quot;Internal Txns&quot; tab and also turn on &quot;Advanced view&quot; so all transactions executed through your DSProxy show up. Here&#39;s one random example illustrating where you will find those: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x251c36771e862d77651ae47cac5ce6d425610576/advanced#internaltx\">https://etherscan.io/address/0x251c36771e862d77651ae47cac5ce6d425610576/advanced#internaltx</a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can also find the list of all (manual and automated) adjustments made to Maker vaults using <a href=\"https://defiexplore.com/\">https://defiexplore.com/</a>.
