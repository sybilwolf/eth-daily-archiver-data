Now, what's the value prop for ALCX tokens you may wonder?

It's possible that one or more of them won't -- no one knows what the future holds.  But I wrote this all out to show folks how I assess the defi space.  This is all public information, and I don't think any of it is priced it.  I'm about to go buy a bunch of ALCX in the hope that it plays out favourably for me.  I'll give it a month or two and see how things go, then reassess my position.
