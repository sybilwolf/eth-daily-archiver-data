It took me a bit to understand what they were trying to accomplish with a free floating algorithmic stablecoin, and now that I do (or <em>think</em> that I do) I am comfortable with the amount that I have in it. </p>\n\n<p>The paper returns have been nice (as have the realized returns...I know the mantra is (3,3) and all, but I did take <em>some</em> off the table after 4 weeks to lower my risk). The near constant and linear price increase over the last few weeks has been fun to watch, but it&#39;s also sending me some &quot;too good to be true&quot; vibes because of it. I can definitely see why people on the fence would be hesitant.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also because of ohm that I am looking into KlimaDAO, which is a fork of ohm and a super cool carbon market project. It could very well be possible to turn a profit while becoming carbon neutral or even negative....I think. I&#39;ll be following this one more closely.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-30 14:13:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hewczwu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pycu5v","parent_id":"t1_hew1jjc","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/baladabest","body":"Today is the day!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Today is the day!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-29 22:01:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hete0ym","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pycu5v","parent_id":"t3_pycu5v","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-29 23:19:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hetkqk7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pycu5v","parent_id":"t3_pycu5v","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SmellyMammoths","body":"https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1443380518498848768","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1443380518498848768\">https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1443380518498848768</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-29 23:21:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hetky4u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pycu5v","parent_id":"t1_hetkqk7","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/headwar","body":"Why are fixed forex rewards so big?
