I recall commenting in <a href=\"/r/bitcoin\">r/bitcoin</a> that we needed to do something similar and that it could massively help awareness and adoption. Basically everyone thought it was a stupid idea and just wanted to hoard their BTC. I met the same response when commenting that we should make purchases with BTC when newegg and overstock started accepting payments. Jeez I wonder if that sentiment has anything to do with why BTC as a source of retail payment is easily 5 years behind the curve.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway back to the point, congratulations OP! You figured a lot of this out much sooner in life than nearly everyone else. Well done.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-02 10:25:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hf4c0dd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pzorc4","parent_id":"t1_hf46zoy","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Exitshuffler","body":"I think the whole NASCAR thing definitely contributed to DOGEs silly brand appeal from early on.
