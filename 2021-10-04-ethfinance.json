Tether and Bitfinex are shady AF, but it's not really a critique of the crypto market as a whole. Certain stocks are heavily manipulated too, but we don't throw the concept of a stock market out the window. And it seems pretty apparent to me that the Tether manipulation hasn't caused Bitcoin or Ethereum to die and won't cause them to die, because it's so much smaller than the overall market at this point. Tether could implode tomorrow and I believe Ethereum would be in the exact same spot 5 years from now as if it didn't implode. Furthermore the Ethereum network has so much utility beyond the ETH token, even if the ETH token were heavily manipulated the network would still have value in settling other tokens.\n\n2. Irreversible transactions are a feature because along with smart contract support, they let you build any kind of arbitrary reversible payment system you want to, in a permissionless way. For example, PayPal could launch a \"PayPal Wrapped ETH\" ERC-20 tomorrow that's 1:1 redeemable for ETH, but allows PayPal to reverse transactions and supports PayPal's dispute resolution process. But not just PayPal or a company with a banking charter could launch a service like this, anybody who can code Solidity could do it. Eventually we will reach a future where only computer systems make transactions on the irreversible layer, and the market is glutted with global reversible ERC-20 payment layers that consumers have their pick over. Compare making a reversible payment layer on Ethereum (hire a smart contract developer and an auditor) with making a reversible payment layer on fiat (raise money to apply for banking charters in every country you want to operate in, create and maintain relationships with the banking systems in those countries, settle using a brittle heterogeneous system of bank transfers, maintain a highly reliable secure and audited database, fight legal battles in countries that have backwards laws against payment systems, hire a department for KYC/AML compliance...)\n\nHappy to get your input and continue this conversation.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I appreciate you opening a conversation here.

Proof of stake requires less energy and therefore less operating expense - this means miners (validators) don't need to make as much in block rewards to make running a node profitable. Again, fewer block rewards > downward pressure on supply > upward pressure on price.

DPoS is a weaker form of proof of stake, is less decentralized and less secure but easier to implement - which is why you see it everywhere. \n4. **Sharding** - Ethereum is in the middle of an upgrade to sharding which is a mechanism for running parallel blockchains allowing greater throughput.\n5. **Development community** - Ethereum has the most vibrant and active development community in the space.\n6. **L2** - Ethereum has the most mature layer-2 ecosystem in the space. Layer-2 refers to scaling protocols built on top of the Layer-1 (the blockchain itself). Bitcoin has the lightning network, Ethereum has Arbitrum, Optimism, DXDY, Loopring, Immutable X, zkSync, Aztec and more.\n\nPrimary arguments against Ethereum:\n\n1. **High fees** - Ethereum has high fees due to its high usage. High fees are a symptom of relatively low throughput combined with extremely high utility. The low throughput is being addressed by the aforementioned transition to proof of stake, sharding and Layer-2s. Other chains have increased their throughput by making tradeoffs to security and decentralization. The ethos of Ethereum is to never make these compromises and to hold security and decentralization as absolute top priorities. Chains that make these security tradeoffs tend to be prone to attacks and will never build the trust required to run the new global financial system. \n2. **The pre-sale** - this is an argument brought up by some people buts its pretty dumb. The Ethereum Foundation originally had a sale of Ether tokens to raise money. They sold Ethereum for Bitcoin to early investors. Not sure why this is even an argument. \n3. **Proof of stake will lead to centralization** - I would argue that proof of stake leads to less centralization than both proof of work and DPoS - both of which require significant hardware investment that naturally centralize over time due to economies of scale. \n4. **Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation have centralized control of the ecosystem** - this is just downright false. The power is in the hands of the community. Yes, Vitalik has a lot more influence than the average person, but he deserves it. Vitalik isn't a dictator with secret keys to the system, he's more of a thought leader. \n5. **Lots more** - lots of people love to hate on Eth just like lots of people like to hate on Bitcoin.

Get last nuc i7, 32gb ram, 2To+ SSD (pro quality). The additional cost is quickly covered, and you buy peace of mind for couple years.\nYou are putting 16/32eth inside, so don't be cheap for couple 100$.\nI used a 1To SSD, and had recently to upgrade to add another To. I tried to move \"ancient\" files of geth, messed with file permissions, and had to delete all a resync from 0. Not a big deal but lost couple hours and a bit of sweat.\n\n\n- check that your internet connection is reliable.\nMine was supposed to be (1gb uncapped fiber) but it turns out that the router provided was a cheap one and it started to freeze randomly. I took my rig at my workplace, same shit (different router and internet provider). I ended up asking for the last version of there router to my internet provider AND added a VPN on my rig which somehow fixed the problem. I don't know if it's because packet encapsulation (going around some kind of traffic management on the router) or the bandwidth throttling induced by the VPN. Anyway since then no more issue at home or at work.\n\n\n- set everything targeting testnet. Try everything for a while, restart procedures, etc. Once confortable with the whole workflow, switch to mainnet. Take your time.\n\n\n- don't worry if something breaks. And most important: do not hurry! The small penalties for being offline is nothing compared to a slashing + forced exit event.\nI had maybe 3/4 days completely offline since January (broken internet or power outage). Sometime it breaks when I was not just near my rig. It took me 4h before accessing it. Again keep cool this is not a big deal.\nDO NOT attempt to put automatic fallback with multiple validator running the same key. I think it's by far the main reason why people have been slashed since last december.

There is plenty of guides and ressources, specific or not.\nAsk around (r/ethstaker) if you need. Do not rush. Try again multiple time if needed.

Best way to do that: beaconch.in app (tells you that an update is available when you open the app), discord announcement, hang around ethfinance/ethstaker. My procedure is when a new version is available, wait for couple days (if not critically urgent) and then upgrade. System upgrades are often not critical on a monthly basis, but clients upgrade must be watched more carefully. So it is definitely not set-and-forget.\nBut with good monitoring, and an easy procedure to stop / upgrade / restart / check, then it is not time consuming at all.\nAs a side note: if there is an emergency issue with a client, and that you are not in the position to upgrade immediately, then best is to switch off your validator, and wait for a better moment when you are more available to properly run the upgrade. \n\n\n- go for it! there is nothing like the DIY feeling \n\n\nHappy staking :)\n\nEdit: formatting","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Once it&#39;s all set up it&#39;s quite smooth.\nMy advices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>don&#39;t try to save on hardware. Get last nuc i7, 32gb ram, 2To+ SSD (pro quality). The additional cost is quickly covered, and you buy peace of mind for couple years.\nYou are putting 16/32eth inside, so don&#39;t be cheap for couple 100$.\nI used a 1To SSD, and had recently to upgrade to add another To. I tried to move &quot;ancient&quot; files of geth, messed with file permissions, and had to delete all a resync from 0. Not a big deal but lost couple hours and a bit of sweat.</p></li>\n<li><p>check that your internet connection is reliable.\nMine was supposed to be (1gb uncapped fiber) but it turns out that the router provided was a cheap one and it started to freeze randomly. I took my rig at my workplace, same shit (different router and internet provider). I ended up asking for the last version of there router to my internet provider AND added a VPN on my rig which somehow fixed the problem. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because packet encapsulation (going around some kind of traffic management on the router) or the bandwidth throttling induced by the VPN. Anyway since then no more issue at home or at work.</p></li>\n<li><p>set everything targeting testnet. Try everything for a while, restart procedures, etc. Once confortable with the whole workflow, switch to mainnet. Take your time.</p></li>\n<li><p>don&#39;t worry if something breaks. And most important: do not hurry! The small penalties for being offline is nothing compared to a slashing + forced exit event.\nI had maybe 3/4 days completely offline since January (broken internet or power outage). Sometime it breaks when I was not just near my rig. It took me 4h before accessing it.

Before you get into the complicated stuff with staking, OHM works kind of like a GLD spdr. It tries to maintain the \"peg\" by arbitraging towards it. So if OHM is $900 and DAI is $1 then OHM is minted regularly and sold to buy DAI and add it to the underlying treasury. If OHM is under $1 then the treasury is sold to buyback OHM. The trick is that when new OHM is minted by this process all of it isn't actually sold for DAI but instead some is issued to stakers. So people are buying OHM despite the sell pressure to get into the issuance. Whether that's a good deal depends on how much you're getting paid in OHM compared to how much sell pressure there is from issuance.

So if OHM is $900 and DAI is $1 then OHM is minted regularly and sold to buy DAI and add it to the underlying treasury. If OHM is under $1 then the treasury is sold to buyback OHM. The trick is that when new OHM is minted by this process all of it isn&#39;t actually sold for DAI but instead some is issued to stakers. So people are buying OHM despite the sell pressure to get into the issuance. Whether that&#39;s a good deal depends on how much you&#39;re getting paid in OHM compared to how much sell pressure there is from issuance. Being off by about 90000% seems a bit steep to me but its obviously working out for a lot of people who aren&#39;t me.

It may be noise to you but I see it as a symptom that people should be aware lest we tolerate it and becomes a problem in the future.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-04 04:45:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfc97vs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q0yqwk","parent_id":"t1_hfc0mbd","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/HarryZKE","body":"Yikes \n\nA classic case of trolling and then a bunch of ppl getting triggered in the replies","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yikes </p>\n\n<p>A classic case of trolling and then a bunch of ppl getting triggered in the replies</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-04 00:04:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfbpq3w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q0yqwk","parent_id":"t1_hfbod30","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/howdeepisyourhouse","body":"But muh gains and muh culture /s","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>But muh gains and muh culture /s</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-04 00:06:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfbpvg0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q0yqwk","parent_id":"t1_hfbpq3w","score":-4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/epic_trader","body":"Get over yourself \ud83d\ude44","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Get over yourself \ud83d\ude44</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-04 01:55:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfbwxm4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q0yqwk","parent_id":"t1_hfbod30","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Mhotdemnot","body":">\nCT is a cesspool of these people harassing others just because they either got lucky flipping NFTs or early\n\nEnvy is obvious","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>CT is a cesspool of these people harassing others just because they either got lucky flipping NFTs or early</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Envy is obvious</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-04 04:52:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfc9upj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q0yqwk","parent_id":"t1_hfbod30","score":-1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"huge RPL dump before launch","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>huge RPL dump before launch</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-04 08:00:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfcvjsd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q0yqwk","parent_id":"t3_q0yqwk","score":-7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Ethical-trade","body":"5% down compared to eth isn't exactly huge in my orderbook","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>5% down compared to eth isn&#39;t exactly huge in my orderbook</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-04 08:02:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfcvupw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q0yqwk","parent_id":"t1_hfcvjsd","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/durkasdelight","body":"thinning out the speculators before launch.. i mean RPL goes on Mainnet tmrw and in the next couple weeks we can anticipate for some news about companies wanted to setup minipools of there own etc.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>thinning out the speculators before launch.. i mean RPL goes on Mainnet tmrw and in the next couple weeks we can anticipate for some news about companies wanted to setup minipools of there own etc.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-04 09:15:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfd66q5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q0yqwk","parent_id":"t1_hfcvjsd","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Pinealforest","body":"Someone sold 160 ETH which moved the price.
