So it appears no one who buys my NFT on OpenSea would be able to access that.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I am assuming enabling/barring features on minted NFTs is for platform competition by design, but this really isn&#39;t good for user experience. Why even enable my NFT to show on OpenSea in the first place if it doesn&#39;t even include the locked content? Kind of annoying.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-05 04:40:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfgujpv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q1nu64","parent_id":"t3_q1nu64","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/R4intra-","body":"Agree this is a confounding issue.

This might not be the best day to ask but what\u2019s a realistic goal for what RocketPool could become in terms of market ranking?\n\nIn my naivety I struggle to identify a large user base. Why wouldn\u2019t large institutional investors invest in their own staking infrastructure for greater control and security instead of using RocketPool? If you are a small retail investor without much to lose why wouldn\u2019t you just use one of the many centralised services that offer staking for free at the convenience of a button? As the price of RPL token increases why do we assume people don\u2019t just move on to free alternatives since the barrier to entry becomes even greater? At present, I can only really identify small hobbyists that strongly oppose centralised services that would be long term users of RocketPool.

They each bet the other that they could get a man to take off his coat. The Wind blew hard, and tried to blow it off of him, but he only pulled it more snugly around him. Then the Sun\u2019s turn came, and the Sun shone warmly on him, and he grew warm and comfortable, and of his own free will, he took off his coat.\n\n>\u201cThat\u2019s fake news!\u201d is Wind. \n\n>\u201cConspiracy theory!\u201d is Wind. \n\n>\u201cBelieve the Facts\u2122!\u201d is Wind. \n\n>\u201cYou\u2019re a science denier!\u201d is Wind.\n\n>Wind has been tried. It doesn\u2019t work. \n\n>Ideamarket is the sun. \n\n>The way to kill an idea is to provide an alternative so superior that it makes the old one irrelevant. \n\n>See Bitcoin. \n\n>Bitcoin is not people getting together in meatspace and burning piles of fiat currency. It\u2019s people trading in the old for the new. It is by virtue of the inherent qualities of the new thing, that the old thing becomes safe and obvious to relinquish. When a new idea is \u201cjust so much better at accomplishing the same things,\u201d then the old idea can be put down willingly \u2014 like the man\u2019s coat.\n\n>The way to kill an idea is by the sheer sanity of a better idea.\n\n>That\u2019s what Ideamarket is for \u2014 it\u2019s for discovering and popularizing ideas of superior sanity, so that common knowledge can evolve without coercion.\n\n>Therefore, negative signaling is not very useful. It\u2019s not important how bad a bad idea is.\n\n>The important thing is how good its potential replacement is.\n\n>The only votes that matter are up.\n\n>Which ideas, which voices, can attract upvotes from all demographics? Those are the unicorns.\n\n>Long sanity.\n\nHe needs to stop using the upvotes metaphor because upvotes are applied to **individual pieces** of information, but Ideamarket operates on the **continuous reputation of a source** of information. But he gets much closer here. I also think \"Long sanity\" is one of my new favorite phrases.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank god, I feel like I&#39;ve been talking to a brick wall lol.

But I think he&#39;s having difficulty really nailing the description of what he&#39;s created, as you can see by that medium post, which is great but, in markedly similar fashion to what happens when trying to explain crypto, the thrust gets a bit diluted in the multiple threads of background description.</p>\n\n<p>However, I went through some of the <a href=\"https://docs.ideamarket.io/\">docs site</a>, and I think he came much closer to a concise description in <a href=\"https://docs.ideamarket.io/philosophy/why-no-shorting\">one place</a>, which I&#39;ll quote in its entirety here for convenience:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why no shorting</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s an Odds Bodkin tale about a wager between the Sun and the Wind. They each bet the other that they could get a man to take off his coat. The Wind blew hard, and tried to blow it off of him, but he only pulled it more snugly around him. Then the Sun\u2019s turn came, and the Sun shone warmly on him, and he grew warm and comfortable, and of his own free will, he took off his coat.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fake news!\u201d is Wind. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cConspiracy theory!\u201d is Wind. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBelieve the Facts\u2122!\u201d is Wind. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a science denier!\u201d is Wind.</p>\n\n<p>Wind has been tried. It doesn\u2019t work. </p>\n\n<p>Ideamarket is the sun. </p>\n\n<p>The way to kill an idea is to provide an alternative so superior that it makes the old one irrelevant. </p>\n\n<p>See Bitcoin. </p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin is not people getting together in meatspace and burning piles of fiat currency. It\u2019s people trading in the old for the new. It is by virtue of the inherent qualities of the new thing, that the old thing becomes safe and obvious to relinquish. When a new idea is \u201cjust so much better at accomplishing the same things,\u201d then the old idea can be put down willingly \u2014 like the man\u2019s coat.</p>\n\n<p>The way to kill an idea is by the sheer sanity of a better idea.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s what Ideamarket is for \u2014 it\u2019s for discovering and popularizing ideas of superior sanity, so that common knowledge can evolve without coercion.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, negative signaling is not very useful. It\u2019s not important how bad a bad idea is.</p>\n\n<p>The important thing is how good its potential replacement is.</p>\n\n<p>The only votes that matter are up.</p>\n\n<p>Which ideas, which voices, can attract upvotes from all demographics? Those are the unicorns.</p>\n\n<p>Long sanity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He needs to stop using the upvotes metaphor because upvotes are applied to <strong>individual pieces</strong> of information, but Ideamarket operates on the <strong>continuous reputation of a source</strong> of information. But he gets much closer here. I also think &quot;Long sanity&quot; is one of my new favorite phrases.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-05 06:25:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfh5qeh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q1nu64","parent_id":"t1_hfh3fe7","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jumnhy","body":"Fascinating stuff, i really will do some reading.\n\nI think the reaction comes from, as u/hblask references, fairly well established failures from perverse incentives in, well, previous \"idea markets\".

They all kind of work the same way: you get a loan that pays for itself because the underlying collateral is used to earn interest, which pays off the loan. Crazy, I know.\n\nTo walk through the scenario in the tweet:\n\nHe's talking about using Abracadabra, and possibly conflating 1 step, although I may be backwards.\n\nYou can deposit your holdings in a Curve pool.\n\nIn this case, the Curve 3pool. You deposit any of USDT, USDC, or DAI onto Curve, you get back 3Crv, which is going to be ~$1 in value, as it represents the basket of stables in the pool, but typically more than $1 in value, as each 3Crv is also accruing yield from Curve as a reward for providing liquidity.\n\nFrom Curve, you can deposit to Convex, which is a symbiotic protocol. Gets a little complicated, but suffice it to say that this just adds further yield on top of the base that you're getting on Curve for your stable deposit.\n\nFrom depositing your 3Crv to Convex, you'll receive cvx3pool, tokens representing your 3crv deposit.\n\nAbracadabra's \"spells\" are magic in that they use the yield-bearing cvx3pool tokens as collateral to back the issuance of \"Magical Internet Money\", or MIM, a dollar-pegged stablecoin.\n\nYou're charged interest on the \"loan\" of MIM, but that interest is less than what you make in yield. Instead of getting the yield directly, it's used to \"pay back\" the loan automatically. Over time, the amount you owe will decrease, as the yield pays off both the interest and principal.\n\nDude in the tweet did this, took the money that he'd use to buy a house, put it in Curve, then Convex, then Abracadabra. Got a loan of MIM equal to 85% of the current value of his cvx3pool. Since the cvx3pool is made up of stablecoins, you don't have to worry excessively that the loan will ever go underwater--ie, getting liquidated. As an added hedge against this Abracadabra maxes out at issuing you only 90% of the value of your collateral, and this guy went a little lower.\n\nTheoretical risk would be if, say, Tether finally collapses, and all the USDT in the underlying pool became worth way less than $1. You don't want to be underwater on your loan and get liquidated, so as long as your collateral remains at least as valuable as your loan, you're golden, and this provides some cushion.\n\nFrom there, dude had to swap his MIM into GUSD (a stablecoin from Gemini, big crypto exchange) which he then took back to Gemini and swapped for USD, bought a house. This sort of structure simply didn't exist for us little people before.\n\nI say the dude might have misstated the process because I think you as the user need to deposit to Convex first, then go to Abracadabra.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Biggest options here would be Alchemix and Abracadabra, I think Liquity as well?
