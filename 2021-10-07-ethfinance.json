I'm feeling that today as great progress is being made at the Ethereum merge workshop. We know that great things take time, but with the implementation of merged clients like [Lighthouse & Geth](https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1445244013385289728) and [Teku & Besu](https://twitter.com/ajsutton/status/1445591699082788868) you know we're on the final stretch in the merge - by that I mean 2022 - I'm excited, not insane. These merge clients are different than what we're currently familiar with because the consensus mechanism is being run by the beacon chain client with data execution being handled by the eth1 client.\n\nIf you're looking for a little deeper view on the merge progress you can check out this [merge readiness checklist](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md) being maintained by Mikhail and Danny.\n\nAs a fun thing to do, I've added a Panda emoji to my twitter account to symbolize excitement for the merge based on /u/benjaminion's fantastic [shirt design](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1445778153809453059). Feel free to join in.\n\nFor the next couple of weeks (October and November), I'll be turning my full focus to client diversity. I really hope you'll throw your sword, or keyboard, or whatever you use to motivate people into the fray. The messaging that I support is pretty basic: Encourage anyone running the majority client (Prysm) to switch to a minority client (Nimbus, Teku, Lighthouse, Lodestar) until no client has more than 50% of the validators on the network. If you're looking for resources related to switching, feel free to check out and comment on my [resources page](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/pxx0oz/ethstaker_comprehensive_list_of_client_switching/).\n\n**Talking Points I encourage related to client diversity:**\n\n* Staking is a job and we should take that job seriously by doing the thing that needs to be done - in this case that means using a minority client.\n\n* We promote the value of the underlying asset by promoting network health. If you want the best return on your investment, help to improve the network.\n\n* The beacon chain network WILL experience turbulence at some point in the future, we can minimize the impact of this by promoting client diversity today.\n\n* We all belong to the Ethereum staking community, client tribalism is unproductive and will reduce our long term success.\n\n* If you stake with an exchange or a service provider, we support you, but please reach out to that provider with all of your passion and encourage them to use a minority client.\n\n**Talking Points I believe are counter productive:**\n\n* The merge will be delayed if we don't achieve client diversity goals! (This is false. The merge will be deployed when the implementation is ready, if it isn't deployed by the developers the community will deploy it.)\n\n* If you don't get away from Prysm the network will fork and all Prysm users will be slashed and ejected! (This is a black swan possibility and uses fear as a motivator. The real risk of this is so low that it's not a valid statement.)\n\n* You'll make bigger staking rewards using Nimbus, Lighthouse, or Teku. (In fact, during normal operation there are no significant differences in the returns provided by the clients.)\n\n* Any discussion that paints Prysm in a bad light. (Prysm is successful because of their early promotion, awesome community, and Windows support. This is good for Prysm.)\n\nFinally, EthStaker is an organization that supports anyone who wants to stake in any way they can. We work to be welcoming first and knowledgeable second.

These new pools on Impermax launched yesterday along with IMX incentives. The old pools will have their IMX rewards halved until Oct 18th when the rewards will end. This means the new pools currently have tons of insane yield opportunities such as 40%+ on WETH and other DeFi tokens, without any IL loss.</p>\n\n<p>For those unfamiliar, Impermax is a leveraged yield farming protocol. You can either leverage your LP tokens for extra yield while being at risk of IL or simply lend tokens to the platform without risk of IL.</p>\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://polygon.impermax.finance/\">https://polygon.impermax.finance/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-07 10:56:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfr7lfi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q31rj5","parent_id":"t3_q31rj5","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"I just came. https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1446111253747814411","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I just came. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1446111253747814411\">https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1446111253747814411</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-07 07:08:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfqamgp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q31rj5","parent_id":"t3_q31rj5","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethrevolution","body":"\u2764\ufe0f u/Liberosist     \nyou're the true MVP, I'm glad we can count you as a community member.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2764\ufe0f <a href=\"/u/Liberosist\">u/Liberosist</a><br/>\nyou&#39;re the true MVP, I&#39;m glad we can count you as a community member.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-07 07:13:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hfqbb4q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q31rj5","parent_id":"t1_hfqamgp","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ModeratelyTortoise","body":"Wait hold on.
