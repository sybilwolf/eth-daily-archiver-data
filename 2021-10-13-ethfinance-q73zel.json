This time: RPL.\n\nThe Rocketpool platform is a decentralized staking platform. Node operators get a little more than solo staking; rETH holders get a little less. It\u2019s the most decentralized staking service we\u2019re likely to see for quite some time so I do anticipate they capture a reasonable market share of the staking market. If nothing else its a pool for tip sharing to smooth out rewards which is valuable for the same reason as mining pools today. Due to it\u2019s status as a staking service the tokenomics of RPL inherently get tied up in the tokenomics of ETH staking. So, first I\u2019ll cover ETH staking predictions, then RPL market share predictions, then the market cap floor set by RPL bonding which is a source of constant argument, and lastly a more reasonable estimate for a target RPL/ETH ratio. PE in a traditional sense isn\u2019t applicable here because the protocol doesn\u2019t capture any of the staking rewards for itself. I also don\u2019t usually cover tokens that haven\u2019t launched yet because acting on speculative parameters has proven to be inaccurate to me but I\u2019ve written enough on this over the months to just collect what I\u2019ve written into this post without too much extra effort. So, with that disclaimer out of the way let\u2019s get to it.\n\nTo start with, I predict ETH will continue piling in to stake until the APR for staking is at least under 5%. Right now the staking rewards don\u2019t include tips because those are going to PoW miners still but after the merge that\u2019s going to change. The more ETH staked, the more diluted the tips become and the smaller the APR per staker from issuance.  So where are we right now? Official data at https://beaconscan.com/. 247285 validators * 32 ETH per validator = 7,913,120 ETH. Let\u2019s call it 8M ETH.\n\nAccording to official data at 8M ETH staked, issuance is ~450k and according to a projection of the tip rate from https://watchtheburn.com/ over the last month there\u2019s another 600k per year that will go to stakers after the merge. This is undershooting a little bit but it\u2019s good enough for illustration. 1.05M ETH rewards distributed amongst 8M ETH staked would be about a 13% APR. So what would it take at current gas levels to dilute the APR to 5%? Approximately 21M ETH staked. RPL notwithstanding that\u2019s a huge ETH vacuum coming our way with demand for another 13M ETH for staking to a market with only about 18M supply on exchanges at the same that issuance will be reduced about 90%.\n\nWith that out of the way let\u2019s cover the RPL staking market share prediction and why it matters for the token value. As I said above, the protocol captures no revenue from stakers directly. Instead the actual use of RPL is to be staked by node operators as a bond for good behavior. The minimum bond is 10% of the staked value. The maximum bond is 150% of staked value. The motivation to stake more is to get an increased share of RPL inflation.\n\nWhen dealing with speculative values I try to set the minimum, the maximum, and then a justification for some ground in between. In this case there are multiple variables which leads to compounding uncertainty. If the market share is 0 then RPL is worthless. That was easy. Any floor assumes RPL adoption. If the market share is 100% and the assumed total ETH staked from the argument above is 21M then the node operators use half of that so there will be ETH value of 10.5M needing to be bonded. So what percent of the staking market share do you think RPL will capture? The centralized exchanges will run their own pools. Solo staking is what is recommended by the Ethereum devs so I assume some people will respect that. IMO, even half is generous. In my opinion we\u2019ll end up in the 20-30% range. You can adjust the remaining numbers for yourself as we go along to arrive at your own speculative price.\n\nNext we have to speculate on the bond percent. Imagine you have some multiple of 440 ETH worth of assets to stake. This makes everything whole numbers. Your choices are:\n\n1) Stake 25 nodes bonded with 10% RPL.\n\n2) Stake 11 nodes bonded by 150% RPL.\n\nWhich do you do? I presume the node operators are rational yield seeking agents. Unless you are making more APR on your bond than your ETH you will choose option 1. What would have to be the case for you to choose option 2? If issuance is high then you\u2019re just diluting supply and unless it is soaked up by expanding demand you should take option 1 because you\u2019ll be getting more RPL but the value of all your RPL will be perpetually falling. If issuance is low then you\u2019re losing out on 5% ETH staking rewards for less than 5% RPL issuance and you\u2019ll take option 1. The only way to profit with option 2 is for the ETH bonded by node operators to expand faster than the inflation rate of RPL so that RPL demand exceeds supply while also having >5% yield on your bonded RPL. That\u2019s a tall order. We\u2019ve already covered that there\u2019s a hard ceiling on the maximum node operator ETH demand. At most it\u2019s 10.5M ETH. A more reasonable estimate is about 2-3M ETH. Once that range is reached, everyone should be choosing option 1. Therefore I expect a bonding percent in the 10-20% range after market saturation. A 10% bond on 2-3M ETH gives you an RPL market share floor of 200-300k ETH. As I write this ETH is priced at about $3500. This would give RPL a rational market cap after saturation of about $700M. The current market cap is about $477M. So there\u2019s room for growth even if I think it\u2019ll take another 2 years for us to reach 21M ETH staked. Let\u2019s set the target bond percent to 15% for the sake of a calculation and move on.\n\n\u201cBut Logris\u2019, that assumes 100% of the RPL circulating supply is bonded.\u201d Yes, I know, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a floor. What is a more reasonable percent of the supply that will be used as a bond by node operators. Other RPL will find a home in governance, liquidity pools, as collateral in Defi, etc. Over 30% of the supply is taken up by the governance council right now. Let\u2019s say another 20% finds it\u2019s home as collateral in Defi and LPs. That doubles our saturation market cap because there\u2019s less RPL to go around to fill those bonds with.\n\nThe only thing remaining is to adjust the market cap by token supply to generate a reasonable RPL/ETH ratio sell target.\n\nETH supply: ~118M (targeted inflation at 0% a year)\n\nRPL supply: ~16M (targeted inflation at 5% a year)\n\nRPL market cap: 21M (eth staked) * .25 (Rocketpool market share) * .5 (node operator half) * .15 (bond percent) / 0.5 (bond percent of supply) = 787,500 ETH * $3500 ETH  = $2.756B\n\nRPL token price at current circulating supply: 2.756B / 16M ~ $172.265\n\nRPL/ETH ratio: 0.049\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a turbulent ride but I don\u2019t think any of these estimates are outlandish or even resembling moon boy targets and even if I\u2019m off by a factor of 2 that\u2019s still like a 5x on the ETH ratio.

There's the 10% opportunity cost of just staking all as ETH. As a point of fact I could find no mechanism *forcing* you to maintain the 10% bond beyond when you join the system. All that happens is you forfeit your share of the RPL issuance. If you don't want RPL anyway, no big deal. So you stake 10%, and as the ETH ratio falls you just let it fall. So, let's consider the 10% a temporary write off. You lose yield on ~9% of your assets and you'll lose some value relative to ETH. What do you get?\n\n1) A higher yield on the remaining ETH. Is it worth sacrificing yield on ~9% of your capital to get an increased yield on the remaining 91%? Let's say you go from 5 to 5.5% yield. The net effect is it's roughly a wash but it obviously depends on rates which are set using market mechanics. If node operators just ape into RPL and outpace rETH holders (I just don't see this happening) then the market share will probably exceed expectations and that 10% bond is going to largely outperform ETH in price. If node operators are scarcer, then rewards to them are higher and will make up for the fact that RPL underperforms. Somewhere in the middle we'll find a balance.\n\n2) Pooled tip sharing. This just smooths out staking rewards for better predictability. Why do people join a mining pool? Because otherwise you can run your node for years and never get a block. Same thing with pooled staking as the number of validators triples from there.\n\n3) Administrative dashboards from Rocketpool. They have actually implemented their own fleet monitoring and control dashboards that make managing a fleet of validators easier than solo staking all the same equipment.

Now what do I mean with that and why do I think it's important (but challenging) to come up with a good approach?\n\nI think at one point the majority of all new, but also existing users won't use L1 anymore. Now for new users there is only one decision to make: \"Which L2 am I going to use?\" and most likely this decision will be heavily influenced by the options given by the CEX where their crypto journey started.\n\nFor most of you (and me) this will be different.\n\n* We have funds on L1\n* We have funds on different addresses on L1 (for e.g. different purposes, holding NFTs, LPing, etc.)\n\nNow \"dust\" might be trapped already because the gas prohibits to move minor ETH and especially ERC20 positions. If you want to hold your ERC20s then you have to transfer them (though technically you could also swap, move ETH and buy again, e.g. on L2, but this might result in taxable events) which is more expensive than moving ETH. With 100 gwei moving ERCs is more or less 15$ (at a 3.5k ETH).\n\nBut obviously we all hope for ETH to rise. So if ETH manages to pass 10k sending ERC20s already is close to 50$. Moving them to L2 will be more or less the same. zksync deposits are slightly higher than moving ERCs.\n\nAt the same time you are probably thinking about gas as well. On the one hand you want it to be low (to move, transact, etc. on L1), on the other hand you want it to be high (because you're staking your ETH and higher fees = higher returns for your staked ETH). I think it's hard to predict what is going to happen regarding gas price on the short term, but longterm it will go up even with the majority of users never touching L1 and only transacting on L2.\n\n**So ETH goes up and gas goes up = tx cost go up exponentially = your funds might be trapped.**\n\nSo what can we do? Move them to L2 obviously, best case during a low gas period. Now, I am sure a lot of people have been experimenting with L2s, I have, but at least I have only transfered minor amounts, less than 5% of my portfolio. Why? Cause I am not sure where my money is allocated best. Arbitrum? Wait for Starknet? zksync with their new EVM? It's hard to say. So many variables, dApps, liquidity... I guess we will use different L2s for different use cases, e.g. have our NFTs on the Layer where OpenSea is (or Shoyu? or something we don't even know yet?).\n\nWhat I would do now is: if you know which L2 you'll use in the future, just transfer \"everything\" now. If you don't, use periods of low gas to consolidate all assets in one wallet. Don't keep minor positions on L1 because longterm even with rising prices it might just not make sense to transfer or sell them.\n\nIf I had to guess, I would think that gas will rise during Q4/Q1 22 especially if it all plays out like we think/ hope. The higher the price, the more demand, the more action there will be. But it's totally possible that after the merge there will be a bear market, both in terms of price and of usage. So I think (!) there is no need to make a decision now. I guess we all will be able to get a better picture of the L2 landscape before we have to make a decision. But don't wait too long. Would be a pity if positions that are actually worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars cant be moved cause you'd basically be burning the same amount of ETH to swap/ transfer/ etc.\n\nAny thoughts?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So a couple of days ago I asked about everyone&#39;s L1 exit strategy.
