It's about momentum, or conviction really. If there's a big green candle and then a small volume red, it would suggest bears can't be bothered to sell off enough to undo that sentiment. That tends to lead to upward continuation.\n\n>And conversely, if that opposite-candle follows up with good volume, then it's not looking good for the continuation of the initial move?\n\nYep. In that case, there wasn't enough bullish support to buy up and undo that dip.\n\n>In these cases, what would be considered \"weak\" and \"good\" volume? If I had to guess, weak would be like < 1/2 the original move, good would be like > 80% the original move?\n\nThis is where a combo of luck and arguably \"experience\" comes into play. It becomes an art not a science, and I don't claim to be great at it.\n\nPersonally, I don't do any near-term decisions below the 4H chart. It's volatile, but does tend to validate patterns. That goes for volume too. I think your guesses are a pretty good baseline, yeah. I think in terms of \"strongly bullish/bearish\" and \"weakly\", as you suggest.\n\nSo right now for example on Coinbase Pro, we're coming off a big green 4H candle with 36k volume. If the next 4 hours only gets 15k of red volume, that's pretty bullish just going off a chart. If it gets close to 36k, then you gotta make some decisions. I'll look back at pre-pump candles to see where volume was resting and where the average is (presently 29k) to judge. It helps because if you only ever go off pump candles where the most volume happens, you'll lose out. Before the pump there was a 16k red candle and before that was a high volume 46k red candle, but it was all to form a red bull hammer meaning it closed below the open but bulls fought back. If this candle is below the prior 16k red candle in volume, even better.\n\nIt's a lot of guess work and subjectivity, but try to take in as many factors as possible. The momentum oscillators like MACD will help guide in a direction too. The MACD is currently green and declining but if it takes too long to flip red.... I like to think of it in terms of energy spent. It takes a lot of energy to stop or reverse momentum. If it happens in one swift dump into red, that's a little bearish. But if they're spending all this time and energy and the MACD is barely dropping, even if it nears the red zone, it's more likely to pop back up green, sooner and stronger because bears used up all the energy just getting it to 0 and have nothing left to make it go negative.\n\nAnd for all of that, the opposite applies. Switch red and green and bulls and bears.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>So if there&#39;s a strong move in either direction followed by an opposite-direction candle with weak volume, is that considered a good sign for the original direction?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, so this is the kind of price action that forms the famous &quot;flags&quot;.
