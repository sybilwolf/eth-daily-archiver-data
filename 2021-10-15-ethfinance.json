Blockspace in general is cheaper (L2 tech), but Ethereum's consensus mechanism (ie, native L1) is largely powering it all, and those same decongesting technologies will be your competition if you're a smallholder still on L1. And by smallholder, well, not even that small. Prices are such that anyone with holdings in the low six figures or under (or even mid+ six figures but with highly fractured liquidity) -- well, we as smallholders will be competing with institutions and economies of scale that need that consensus layer. My understanding of scaling tech is still nascent, but I think I'm characterizing this correctly.\n\nHere's my very rough math, familiar to almost anyone who's transacted on Ethereum in the last 2 years. Transaction fees are typically denominated in dollars, ie, it'll cost roughly the same in USD to perform a transfer given the same overall network demand -- if ETH doubles in price, the gas market will correct so that gas fees go down by half, preserving the dollar cost. People don't want to \"overpay\" in USD terms to use the market, even if it means over/underpaying in ETH. \n\nFor the last 3 months, based on the median daily gas prices as seen here (https://dune.xyz/queries/4297/8371), a basic transfer is priced somewhere in the $5-15 range, trending upward fairly strongly. An ERC20 transfer runs double that, call it $10-30, and a simple swap on a dex, maybe 6X that, call it $30-90.\n\nI'm using a basic transfer as a benchmark, because I'm thinking about folks who have less than $5,000, or even $10,000, in their portfolio. \n\nExample 1: If you've got a $5000 portfolio, $3.5k in ETH, and $500 each in 3 altcoins, you're already at a level where taking what seems to be the cheapest liquidation option (transfers to a CEX) will cost you ~2%. If you're not straight HODLing, and you threw ~$1000 into Curve in stablecoins back in early summer 2020, you'll be looking at easily 7-10%+ already, at today's fees. Curve is particularly onerous for gas costs, but the point stands.\n\nExample 2: say you're someone who got the UNI airdrop, and you're currently still holding 1/4 of the initial drop. I think that's a lot of folks around here, no? $2500, maybe $3000 in UNI. Liquidating it, even before the cheapest swap fees on Uniswap, could cost you 5% right now. And that's if you don't need to throw in an approval along the way. Demand spikes, you're looking at easily 10, 20% in fees. We could well get to the point where an L1 transfer (say you're just going to transfer to a CEX and liquidate to fiat there) runs ~$100+, with even simple swaps and the like running hundreds of dollars.\n\nAnd even if your portfolio roughly tracks the blockspace demand (and by proxy, blockspace pricing), you still don't need to piss away hundreds or thousands on fees if you can avoid it.\n\n**So what's your exit strategy?** \n\nMy plan is very much unrealized. I know I'm going to be consolidating some holdings and unwinding some positions, but I'm not sure where to take my assets. \n\na.) Consolidating my portfolio. Capitalize on economy of scale. Selling off 5 positions is cheaper than selling off 25. \n\nb.) Similarly, unwinding the handful of legacy farming positions currently earning 3-15% (Yearn, Badger, Aave) now, as these are even more gas-expensive to get in and out of. Sucks, but if you've got less than ~$10k still sitting in Curve, Compound, Yearn, Aave, Balancer, Uni, particularly if it's in stables that won't track the rest of the market, it's time to pull up the stakes and move the circus if you haven't already. Even if you do have $10k, do you want to pay $500 in gas to get it out in a year?\n\n\nBut the rest is largely a mystery to me.\nDo I migrate straight to a CEX? \nDo I migrate to another non-L1 solution? \nAnd if I jump onto an L2/rollup entirely, do I diversify my risk exposure across options, but incur the resulting transfer fees? \nCan I start by moving all my ERC20s to Arbitrum, and then bridge half to Optimism more cheaply than going L1 to two rollups? Is there sufficient liquidity on these options for some of the smaller cap assets I hold? I don't expect anyone to answer these questions for me, but they're things i think we all need to be applying to our own holdings and specific situations.\n\nAnyhow, I'm curious to know what my EthFinance family is doing and thinking. It's immensely frustrating to look at some of my smaller (<$500) speculative positions, and I can't imagine that I'm alone in this.\n\nu/Swagtimusprime \n\nu/SmellyMammoth\n\nWould love y'all's input on this one!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Revisiting a thread from a recent daily that I think deserves some more discussion.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s your L1 exit strategy, especially for smaller portfolios, or even highly diversified larger portfolios?</p>\n\n<p>Do we expect L1 demand to ever be substantially less than it is today? </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t.

We could well get to the point where an L1 transfer (say you&#39;re just going to transfer to a CEX and liquidate to fiat there) runs ~$100+, with even simple swaps and the like running hundreds of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>And even if your portfolio roughly tracks the blockspace demand (and by proxy, blockspace pricing), you still don&#39;t need to piss away hundreds or thousands on fees if you can avoid it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what&#39;s your exit strategy?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>My plan is very much unrealized. I know I&#39;m going to be consolidating some holdings and unwinding some positions, but I&#39;m not sure where to take my assets. </p>\n\n<p>a.) Consolidating my portfolio. Capitalize on economy of scale. Selling off 5 positions is cheaper than selling off 25. </p>\n\n<p>b.) Similarly, unwinding the handful of legacy farming positions currently earning 3-15% (Yearn, Badger, Aave) now, as these are even more gas-expensive to get in and out of. Sucks, but if you&#39;ve got less than ~$10k still sitting in Curve, Compound, Yearn, Aave, Balancer, Uni, particularly if it&#39;s in stables that won&#39;t track the rest of the market, it&#39;s time to pull up the stakes and move the circus if you haven&#39;t already. Even if you do have $10k, do you want to pay $500 in gas to get it out in a year?</p>\n\n<p>But the rest is largely a mystery to me.\nDo I migrate straight to a CEX? \nDo I migrate to another non-L1 solution? \nAnd if I jump onto an L2/rollup entirely, do I diversify my risk exposure across options, but incur the resulting transfer fees? \nCan I start by moving all my ERC20s to Arbitrum, and then bridge half to Optimism more cheaply than going L1 to two rollups? Is there sufficient liquidity on these options for some of the smaller cap assets I hold? I don&#39;t expect anyone to answer these questions for me, but they&#39;re things i think we all need to be applying to our own holdings and specific situations.</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, I&#39;m curious to know what my EthFinance family is doing and thinking. It&#39;s immensely frustrating to look at some of my smaller (&lt;$500) speculative positions, and I can&#39;t imagine that I&#39;m alone in this.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Swagtimusprime\">u/Swagtimusprime</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/SmellyMammoth\">u/SmellyMammoth</a></p>\n\n<p>Would love y&#39;all&#39;s input on this one!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-15 11:23:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hgrom6p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q8h5hn","parent_id":"t3_q8h5hn","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/HarryZKE","body":"Personally I gave up on holding almost any L1 DeFi position a long time ago \n\nIt\u2019s time to be L2 pioneers\n\nFunctionality is slowly getting built out, it\u2019s a process","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Personally I gave up on holding almost any L1 DeFi position a long time ago </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s time to be L2 pioneers</p>\n\n<p>Functionality is slowly getting built out, it\u2019s a process</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-15 11:35:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hgrqg8a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q8h5hn","parent_id":"t1_hgrom6p","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jumnhy","body":"I'm out of everything (on L1) except Yearn's vaults, but my smaller simple token holdings are worth quite a bit on paper but that fractured liquidity will kill me when I actually do consolidate.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m out of everything (on L1) except Yearn&#39;s vaults, but my smaller simple token holdings are worth quite a bit on paper but that fractured liquidity will kill me when I actually do consolidate.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-15 11:39:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hgrr0a5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q8h5hn","parent_id":"t1_hgrqg8a","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/anor_wondo","body":"I put my shapeshift airdrop into it's staking pool now it's worthless compared to fees.

Lends greater legitimacy to the space (the SEC approving a crypto ETF is really an eye opener for many boomers and no coiners, as it marks a stamp of legitimacy to the industry by the US financial regulatory system, just as Coinbase, a crypto exchange, getting listed on the Nasdaq was a watershed moment), and 3. Increased publicity as every news channel  across the globe covers this, which usually translates into more retail interest\n\nHowever, in the long run, this will do the same as ETFs and other paper derivatives did to gold.

Lends greater legitimacy to the space (the SEC approving a crypto ETF is really an eye opener for many boomers and no coiners, as it marks a stamp of legitimacy to the industry by the US financial regulatory system, just as Coinbase, a crypto exchange, getting listed on the Nasdaq was a watershed moment), and 3. Increased publicity as every news channel  across the globe covers this, which usually translates into more retail interest</p>\n\n<p>However, in the long run, this will do the same as ETFs and other paper derivatives did to gold.

There aren't many sources of yield in DeFi and effectively everything boils down to lending and AMM fees juiced by inflationary protocol token emissions. The olympus pro model theoretically allows protocols to decrease inflationary protocol token emissions (which they use to attract independent liquidity providers) by buying the LP positions with bonds. This gives the protocol more control over liquidity depth and they don't have to inflate their protocol token to do so. Great. \n\nIf/When this were to become the dominant model throughout DeFi for the above stated reasons, you no longer have the juiced DeFi yields as emissions are down across the ecosystem in favor of the bond model. I think this would significantly reduce the yields across DeFi. I don't think this is necessarily an overall long term bad thing for the ecosystem however. The reliance on inflationary emissions IMO is a fragile positive feedback loop which would go in the other direction anyway if/when we hit a true bear market like 2018. But for something like Alchemix, that relies on yield from Yearn, which basically just farms all these emissions, in the olympus pro dominant model the loan repayments are going to take significantly longer. Maybe Defi adoption picks up to the point where the \"unjuiced\" fees make up the difference. Hopefully this leads to innovation and broadening of the yield sources throughout the ecosystem, which I think is needed regardless of whether or not this theoretical scenario plays out.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Someone jump in where I&#39;m wrong here. There aren&#39;t many sources of yield in DeFi and effectively everything boils down to lending and AMM fees juiced by inflationary protocol token emissions. The olympus pro model theoretically allows protocols to decrease inflationary protocol token emissions (which they use to attract independent liquidity providers) by buying the LP positions with bonds. This gives the protocol more control over liquidity depth and they don&#39;t have to inflate their protocol token to do so. Great. </p>\n\n<p>If/When this were to become the dominant model throughout DeFi for the above stated reasons, you no longer have the juiced DeFi yields as emissions are down across the ecosystem in favor of the bond model. I think this would significantly reduce the yields across DeFi. I don&#39;t think this is necessarily an overall long term bad thing for the ecosystem however. The reliance on inflationary emissions IMO is a fragile positive feedback loop which would go in the other direction anyway if/when we hit a true bear market like 2018. But for something like Alchemix, that relies on yield from Yearn, which basically just farms all these emissions, in the olympus pro dominant model the loan repayments are going to take significantly longer. Maybe Defi adoption picks up to the point where the &quot;unjuiced&quot; fees make up the difference. Hopefully this leads to innovation and broadening of the yield sources throughout the ecosystem, which I think is needed regardless of whether or not this theoretical scenario plays out.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-15 10:14:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hgrenex","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q8h5hn","parent_id":"t1_hgr86ij","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"You are right.

Badger is trying to raise the Curve BTC pool rates to well above what Bancor is offering, ETH has solid options on Tokemak, Impermax, and alETH, and LINK... well maybe just use Nexo and save myself a lot of gas for the amount I own.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything from the list of features <a href=\"https://blog.bancor.network/the-bancorian-a-weekly-summary-october-3rd-2021-836d5abac8d\">here</a> that excites you?
