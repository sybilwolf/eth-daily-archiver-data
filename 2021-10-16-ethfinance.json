They *own* 99% of their liquidity from selling bonds, and are generating a sizable amount of income daily from LP-ing. Their bond program is also generating income and has been adopted by 7 other platforms at the moment. Should OHM be trading at 1k+ when each token is only \"backed\" by (last I checked, 22 USD in assets)? My gut says no, that is a *sizable* premium.

I own some spell, I have it staked, I deposited that staked spell as collateral, and I borrowed some magic internet money against it. Haven't decided what to do with the MIM yet. I'm hesitant to go long on spell. I am leaning towards a market buy of eth. The giga degen play would be to buy more ohm with it, stake that ohm, then deposit that staked ohm **back** into abra and borrow more. \n\nOr I could just go to the gym or get the car washed or something. IDK it's still early in the day.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the KlimaDAO launch is on Monday, and while I don't have enough info to write about it, I have set myself up on polygon to get involved.
