Since only the inputs and outputs are committed on-chain, the computation itself can handle deeper game mechanics to ensure a compelling in-game experience that isn\u2019t held back by layer 1 computation limitations.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Crew Assignments</strong><br/>\nInfluence\u2019s in-game events system will launch initially with \u201cCrew Assignments\u201d intended to allow players to utilize their crew early, pre-Exploitation release. These event chains will enable customization of crew, and provide for some early distribution of rewards as players participate in the scuttling of the Arvad and early settlement of Adalia Prime. Crew assignments will take advantage of StarkNet to provide all of the benefits above and ease the transition from layer 1 to layer 2.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-20 11:58:54","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-10-20 12:03:39","id":"hhe9xtm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qbtchn","parent_id":"t1_hhe4lf7","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Liberosist","body":"I can only offer you a vague overview that because reprocessing is not required (just verify the proof), computations can be orders of magnitude more complex than possible with L1s - which need all nodes to reprocess everything.

He manages to balance work and engaging with the community, and he's talented at breaking down the complicated science of leveraged LPs into simpler terms. There is a clarity of vision here, that I personally struggle to see elsewhere in crypto (beyond Ethereum itself).\n\nThat is perhaps both the strength and the weakness of this protocol. For now, it's tough to see Impermax thriving without the guiding hand of its benevolent dictator.

For example: once leveraged, the SPELL/ETH pair pays out 3 digits APR in SPELL but only a few % in IMX, and that pair is now the second most popular on the Arbitrum app.</p>\n\n<p>The plan is laid out in the open. Keep iterating and improving. Move the ratio towards less IMX rewards and more thirdparty rewards.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s rumors of other individuals and protocols working behind the scenes to come up with Impermax vaults and aggregators to expand protocol use beyond advanced users.</p>\n\n<p>On a personal level, my own bet is a gamble on the lead developer, Simone Rigolon. He manages to balance work and engaging with the community, and he&#39;s talented at breaking down the complicated science of leveraged LPs into simpler terms. There is a clarity of vision here, that I personally struggle to see elsewhere in crypto (beyond Ethereum itself).</p>\n\n<p>That is perhaps both the strength and the weakness of this protocol. For now, it&#39;s tough to see Impermax thriving without the guiding hand of its benevolent dictator. But this is an argument that could ring true for almost every project, even billion dollar marketcaps - outsized gains through entry at the early stage tend to require making bets on personalities.</p>\n\n<p>My advice on IMX is always the same: try Impermax first. The Polygon app is accessible, thanks to gas fees being negligible. Play with $5 worth of money. See if the product itself makes sense to you, before touching the token.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-20 17:39:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhfm389","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qbtchn","parent_id":"t1_hheu4pn","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SilkTouchm","body":"Great post, thanks.
