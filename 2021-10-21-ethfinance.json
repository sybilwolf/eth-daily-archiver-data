From there, the next big milestone is closing below 93.30 where the last week of September opened. After that, it's about how low can it go during our bull season, should it continue.

That being said, I think you have a couple of options.\n\nFirst, you could take a loan against the value of your ETH.

But at least you\u2019d have access to cash without incurring an income event. If you went this route, I\u2019d suggest using Maker via DefiSaver. Stay away from anything that gives you a token in exchange for your collateral (Compound, Aave), because that\u2019s much more likely to be considered a taxable event. Also, stay away from anything that could reasonably have a negative interest rate like Liquity, Reflexer, or Alchemix because negative interest on a loan would count as income and could unexpectedly push you over an income threshold and disqualify you from the programs you\u2019re in. \n\nSecond, you could bite the bullet and sell a bunch of your holdings now or at whatever price works for you. Make sure you cash out enough to cover what you want to buy plus living expenses for a year (don\u2019t forget taxes). Eat the costs of the lack of pension and pay for more expensive healthcare for that one year, and then re-apply for the pension and health care the year after.

This option depends on how easy it is to get back into the program once you\u2019re out of it of course. \n\nRegarding putting half your stack into stablecoins, you would have to pay taxes on your gains which would likely disqualify you out of the program again.
