This little dip is a local phenomenon.\n\nStocks\n\n* ATHs for the S&P and Dow this week. Strong af.\n* Not the Nasdaq though because American tech needs to stop being shitty (Facebook) and having shitty businesses (Snap). The soaring 10Y yields also tend to wreck tech (rektek). TNX (1.656) closed above the 200 Week EMA for the first time in 2.5 years. It's near guaranteed to go test 1.75, likely going to test 1.90s, and people smarter than I am seem confident it will top 2.00 once more before the FORTY-YEAR-LONG downtrend in yields continues. In a word, tech will be under pressure and likely lagging the next few months.\n* SPY (453.12) closed at its weekly ATH. If it needs a breather, there's the 50 Week EMA down at 443.50 due for a retest. And on the way there are nice gaps at 447-449 and 442-444 to possibly fill and bounce off. The major gap from 435-439 is likely behind us, unlikely to fill until the real market correction happens.\n* DXY (93.61) great weekly close for us in crypto and equities. It closed below the prior October low at 93.67 meaning it's in a downtrend and we'll look to see how low it can go before a bounce. Big, big support zones at 93.50 (Aug high), 93.25 (Sept decision point), and 92.90 (July high). On a daily level, it certainly looks more like bearish continuation than anything else. We'll see what next week brings.\n* VIX (15.44) - this is a pretty historic support level, the candles are in a descending wedge, and bands are tight. It is more likely than not we get a little volatility this week or next. That would pair nicely with the SPY resting and building a new floor and the dollar trying to repair before a cliff.\n\nBTC\n\n* The lines it battled with on the way up are the ones we're still battling on the way *back* up. Presently that's $61.2k. \n* Daily MACD just flipped red. The Stoch average has rolled over. The 20 Day moving average at $58k looks ready for a retest. More likely is a sting down to the fib line at $57.2k.\n* With weekend low volume, I'm not sure even daily closes above $61.2k mean much. I think at bare minimum it needs to get back above the 8 Day MA at $62.3k and we're not bullish again (on a daily timescale) until the old ATH $64.8k is broken, tested, and left in the dust.\n* The weekly scale... The bull is by no means over, but the RSI is about two months ahead (hotter) than last year. The momentum resembles Dec 2020 more than Oct 2020. So everything is still in place, but a prolonged market top into next May for example is growing less likely. This makes me think another December ending to the BTC bull is in order.\n* As well, BTC is less than $1000 above chalking in a gravestone candle on the weekly. That's not great, a trend reversal candle. It's the kind of thing that can take more than just days to repair, but can take weeks. If it were to close below here come Sunday, that doesn't just put $57.2k back in play, it puts the 61.8 fib at ***$51.2k*** back in play at least for a tickle. The 8 Week MA wherever it is at the time of test would also be a crazy strong place to bounce. Be wary.\n\nETH\n\n* Getting out ahead of the obvious questions... No, none of the above weekly analysis applies to ETH at this point. The patterns don't exist and ETH has waaaaaaay more headroom on RSI. Sure seems to align with yet another December BTC top and Jan/Feb ETH top...\n* ETHBTC is holding up shockingly well. It'll probably start to stagnate or bleed again as daily RSI is running hot. But even the current downtrend ain't that bad, showing over 0.058 even in December when I expect we'd suddenly reverse and head into our Q1 blowoff top.\n* For a fun pie-in-the-sky thought, if ETHBTC miraculously closed this week (or even next week) back at 0.07, it'd create a weekly scale morning star pattern -- hyper bullish reversal pattern. But that's not gonna happen even though the setup is there on the charts. Just having fun dreaming.\n* Ultimately, I'm just waiting and watching. I'd love to close the week back above $4140. If not, then maybe forming a floor at $3950 or so is second prize.\n\nQCCC?

If it needs a breather, there&#39;s the 50 Week EMA down at 443.50 due for a retest. And on the way there are nice gaps at 447-449 and 442-444 to possibly fill and bounce off. The major gap from 435-439 is likely behind us, unlikely to fill until the real market correction happens.</li>\n<li>DXY (93.61) great weekly close for us in crypto and equities. It closed below the prior October low at 93.67 meaning it&#39;s in a downtrend and we&#39;ll look to see how low it can go before a bounce. Big, big support zones at 93.50 (Aug high), 93.25 (Sept decision point), and 92.90 (July high). On a daily level, it certainly looks more like bearish continuation than anything else. We&#39;ll see what next week brings.</li>\n<li>VIX (15.44) - this is a pretty historic support level, the candles are in a descending wedge, and bands are tight. It is more likely than not we get a little volatility this week or next. That would pair nicely with the SPY resting and building a new floor and the dollar trying to repair before a cliff.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>BTC</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The lines it battled with on the way up are the ones we&#39;re still battling on the way <em>back</em> up. Presently that&#39;s $61.2k. </li>\n<li>Daily MACD just flipped red. The Stoch average has rolled over. The 20 Day moving average at $58k looks ready for a retest. More likely is a sting down to the fib line at $57.2k.</li>\n<li>With weekend low volume, I&#39;m not sure even daily closes above $61.2k mean much. I think at bare minimum it needs to get back above the 8 Day MA at $62.3k and we&#39;re not bullish again (on a daily timescale) until the old ATH $64.8k is broken, tested, and left in the dust.</li>\n<li>The weekly scale... The bull is by no means over, but the RSI is about two months ahead (hotter) than last year. The momentum resembles Dec 2020 more than Oct 2020. So everything is still in place, but a prolonged market top into next May for example is growing less likely. This makes me think another December ending to the BTC bull is in order.</li>\n<li>As well, BTC is less than $1000 above chalking in a gravestone candle on the weekly. That&#39;s not great, a trend reversal candle. It&#39;s the kind of thing that can take more than just days to repair, but can take weeks. If it were to close below here come Sunday, that doesn&#39;t just put $57.2k back in play, it puts the 61.8 fib at <strong><em>$51.2k</em></strong> back in play at least for a tickle. The 8 Week MA wherever it is at the time of test would also be a crazy strong place to bounce. Be wary.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>ETH</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Getting out ahead of the obvious questions... No, none of the above weekly analysis applies to ETH at this point. The patterns don&#39;t exist and ETH has waaaaaaay more headroom on RSI. Sure seems to align with yet another December BTC top and Jan/Feb ETH top...</li>\n<li>ETHBTC is holding up shockingly well. It&#39;ll probably start to stagnate or bleed again as daily RSI is running hot. But even the current downtrend ain&#39;t that bad, showing over 0.058 even in December when I expect we&#39;d suddenly reverse and head into our Q1 blowoff top.</li>\n<li>For a fun pie-in-the-sky thought, if ETHBTC miraculously closed this week (or even next week) back at 0.07, it&#39;d create a weekly scale morning star pattern -- hyper bullish reversal pattern. But that&#39;s not gonna happen even though the setup is there on the charts. Just having fun dreaming.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, I&#39;m just waiting and watching. I&#39;d love to close the week back above $4140. If not, then maybe forming a floor at $3950 or so is second prize.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>QCCC? Cheers!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-23 01:23:52","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-10-23 11:19:36","id":"hhq06pe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qdy860","parent_id":"t3_qdy860","score":87,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/freak_ch","body":"Thanks KBrot, i really appreciate your posts.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks KBrot, i really appreciate your posts.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-23 02:06:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhq31jw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qdy860","parent_id":"t1_hhq06pe","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"Thanks, my friend.

We know the effect of $1 of bribes on attracting liquidity from the recent experiments of Alchemix. So we can look up the voting power in those past bribes and look at how many CVX we would have to vote with to accomplish the same.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-23 18:45:59","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-10-23 19:46:19","id":"hht7xwm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qdy860","parent_id":"t3_qdy860","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"I\u2019m on my phone so no link but have you seen the Yunt Capital article/blog post that was posted here in the last few days?
