The report will also urge Congress to pass legislation specifying coins should be regulated similarly to bank deposits, one of the people said, asking not to be named because discussions are private. \n\nLanguage was added to emphasize the SEC\u2019s powers after its chair, Gary Gensler, pushed for changes behind closed doors, the people said. The recommendations could reinforce the SEC\u2019s ability to pursue enforcement actions and policies for cryptocurrencies. \n\nThe revisions he sought make clear that the government will take an active role in regulating stablecoins even as it waits for longer-term plans to be implemented. For industry executives, Gensler\u2019s successful lobbying is likely to come as bad news because they already argue his agency has been overreaching. \n\nEarly versions of the report called for lawmakers to pass legislation that would, among other things, create a new type of bank charter for companies that issue stablecoins. In recent weeks, Gensler pushed to clarify the SEC has existing powers to oversee tokens when they\u2019re involved in investment transactions, the people said. Any bill faces long odds in a divided Congress and could take years to enact. \n\nThe report will also reaffirm that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has a role in overseeing stablecoins. \n\nSpokespeople for the SEC, CFTC and Treasury declined to comment on the report.\n\nRegulators\u2019 Concerns\nFinancial regulators are increasingly concerned about the risks tokens pose to the financial system following the sector\u2019s rapid growth. Tether\u2019s market value has grown to nearly $70 billion from $21 billion at the end of 2020, according to CoinMarketCap.com. USD Coin, the second-largest such coin, increased to $32.6 billion from $3.9 billion last year. \n\nStablecoins play a crucial role in the crypto market. Their value is tied to other assets, like the U.S. dollar, and companies typically commit to keeping reserves that ensure investors can exchange the tokens for regular currency. \n\nAuthorities are already cracking down. In February, Tether settled with the New York Attorney General over allegations that it lied about the reserves backing the coin. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission earlier this month ordered Tether to pay $41 million over similar claims.\n\nThe pending report is being prepared by the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets with a goal of ensuring coins don\u2019t threaten the economy and wants to clarify how the Biden administration will regulate the sector across several agencies likely to have a role. The group is also likely to propose that the Financial Stability Oversight Council, another council of regulators, formally assess whether tokens pose a systemic risk.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t helping the system at all if what is called a stablecoin is actually not stable, so you don\u2019t want to allow that kind of risk to build,\u201d said Treasury Undersecretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang at a financial-technology conference hosted by Georgetown University Law Center last week.\n\nSEC Investigations\nGensler has previously said that many stablecoins, which sometimes invest in corporate bonds and other assets, look similar to money-market mutual funds and could fall under his authority.

But that actually isn\u2019t the case. I have standards. I don\u2019t fuck with any of that lab made bull shit which comes onto the market during the late stage bull cycle like the one just ahead of us. My hopium is the highest quality authentic afghan hopium. So what does this mean? It means you get the high you\u2019re after with none of the comedown and disillusionment when what was promised doesn\u2019t come to fruition - a trend oh so common with late stage bull lab made hopium. The lab made stuff just doesn\u2019t keep you grounded in reality and the later in the bull run, the more pie in the sky the predictions and promises get so they inevitably let you down. That\u2019s why I stand by my hopium. Nothing has changed from day one of the bull market. It\u2019s a tried and true recipe with the same realistic moonboi scenarios which are actually achievable so you still get the rush and excitement you crave but none of the disillusionment and withdrawals you don\u2019t want.\n\nNow with the above disclaimer in mind, I\u2019d like to give you a preview of the next batch I\u2019ve got cooking for you all. I apologise if at first it feels a bit weak in comparison to some of that lab made shit I\u2019ve seen thrown around a bit lately but I promise this stuff will hit hard if you give it time and it won\u2019t let you down afterwards like the other stuff will.\n\n>So many of the people in this subreddit and in the wider Ethereum community are speculating what will happen after the merge goes live. We are about to see an unprecedented reduction in the issuance of the world\u2019s most in-demand crypto asset coinciding with a time which would typically be the beginning of the bear market for Bitcoin and hence the wider crypto markets. Some say this will lead to the flippening and an \u201cETH super cycle\u201d as the reduction in issuance and activation of ultra-sound money will create the biggest supply shock ever seen, causing ETH to go stratospheric. I think this is bull shit. This is not grounded in reality. But that\u2019s OK. We may not be heading to $50K by the end of 2022, hell, we\u2019re probably not even going to $25K this cycle. But I think what Ethereum has in store for us is even better. You just have to be patient.\n\n>So please hear me out. I\u2019ve spent the best part of the last year thinking about this ever since ETH 2.0 went live. But I think I have a good guess as to how this will all play out and what this rocket ship\u2019s trajectory to the moon and beyond looks like.\n\nHopefully I\u2019ll have this next batch completed by the end of the week. Feel free to @ me if I get lazy and leave it in the oven for too long. This stuff will be potent and I hope for it to be in your blood stream by the weekend.\n\n-----------------\n\n^(For those of you who don\u2019t get the hopium metaphor, what I\u2019m trying to say is be weary of moving goalposts as ETH creeps higher. Those calling for $10K will start calling for $20K, $50K and beyond in the next few months as we approach $10K. Don\u2019t fall into this trap. ETH will get to $100K one day and it will flip BTC too but recency bias and euphoria will leave you thinking we\u2019re going to those numbers tomorrow when in reality we likely won\u2019t and you\u2019ll be left disappointed and wearing nothing but underwear in your parents basement eating ramen noodles for another 4 years.)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ok guys, so you all probably think I\u2019m a just a run of the mill hopium dealer just trying to give you the best high possible and I\u2019ll just get the hardest hitting hopium from anywhere I can. But that actually isn\u2019t the case. I have standards. I don\u2019t fuck with any of that lab made bull shit which comes onto the market during the late stage bull cycle like the one just ahead of us. My hopium is the highest quality authentic afghan hopium. So what does this mean? It means you get the high you\u2019re after with none of the comedown and disillusionment when what was promised doesn\u2019t come to fruition - a trend oh so common with late stage bull lab made hopium. The lab made stuff just doesn\u2019t keep you grounded in reality and the later in the bull run, the more pie in the sky the predictions and promises get so they inevitably let you down. That\u2019s why I stand by my hopium. Nothing has changed from day one of the bull market. It\u2019s a tried and true recipe with the same realistic moonboi scenarios which are actually achievable so you still get the rush and excitement you crave but none of the disillusionment and withdrawals you don\u2019t want.</p>\n\n<p>Now with the above disclaimer in mind, I\u2019d like to give you a preview of the next batch I\u2019ve got cooking for you all. I apologise if at first it feels a bit weak in comparison to some of that lab made shit I\u2019ve seen thrown around a bit lately but I promise this stuff will hit hard if you give it time and it won\u2019t let you down afterwards like the other stuff will.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So many of the people in this subreddit and in the wider Ethereum community are speculating what will happen after the merge goes live. We are about to see an unprecedented reduction in the issuance of the world\u2019s most in-demand crypto asset coinciding with a time which would typically be the beginning of the bear market for Bitcoin and hence the wider crypto markets. Some say this will lead to the flippening and an \u201cETH super cycle\u201d as the reduction in issuance and activation of ultra-sound money will create the biggest supply shock ever seen, causing ETH to go stratospheric. I think this is bull shit. This is not grounded in reality. But that\u2019s OK. We may not be heading to $50K by the end of 2022, hell, we\u2019re probably not even going to $25K this cycle. But I think what Ethereum has in store for us is even better. You just have to be patient.</p>\n\n<p>So please hear me out. I\u2019ve spent the best part of the last year thinking about this ever since ETH 2.0 went live. But I think I have a good guess as to how this will all play out and what this rocket ship\u2019s trajectory to the moon and beyond looks like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hopefully I\u2019ll have this next batch completed by the end of the week. Feel free to @ me if I get lazy and leave it in the oven for too long. This stuff will be potent and I hope for it to be in your blood stream by the weekend.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><sup>For those of you who don\u2019t get the hopium metaphor, what I\u2019m trying to say is be weary of moving goalposts as ETH creeps higher.
