That's basically the demand for blockspace today.\"\n\nI don't think that's necessarily true. For every $60 token swap happening on Ethereum today, I think there are almost certainly ten times as many $6 swaps that would take place, if they could. They're not happening on Solana, or Polygon, or even Arbitrum because none of those chains offer the combination of security and access to the vast infrastructure of DeFi and NFTs that Ethereum L1 currently offers. Put another way, not all transactions are created equal, and the market knows it. It's willing to spend 10x or 100x as much to do a transaction on Ethereum versus anywhere else. If Ethereum block space became 1000x cheaper, there's a MASSIVE pent-up demand of transactions that simply never considered looking at another chain, for the various reasons above, but would jump at the chance on Ethereum.

It just so happens that Ohm has such a high demand that the incremental stock split is not enough to make the price drop. It\u2019s kind of like when tesla did a stock split but then the price shot right back up to where it was pre-split. \n\nThe difference is the stock split is incredibly profitable for the Olympus Dao treasury. Ohm is only guaranteed to be one dollar. Oympus Dao sells Ohms for much more than $1 (like over $1k rn). Every dollar that gets added to the Olympus Dao treasury just increases the runway that they can offer high apy for. (more dollars in treasury more ohm they can create out of thin air and give to stakers bc that ohm only really needs to have at least $1 dollar backing it). When Olympus Dao sells Ohm, one is given to the person who bought it and one is distributed to stakers (aka why the apy is dilution but also profitable for the treasury)\n\nThe biggest question you might have is why is there demand for Ohm? Why is the demand so high which is keeping the price high despite dilution?  Well, if you believe the Ohm treasury will continue to grow than investing in Ohm is a no brainer. Treasury is 600M, market cap is 3.6B. So the treasury just needs to ~5x for your ohm investment to be profitable regardless of Ohm price. And by selling Ohm, solving Defi\u2019s liquidity rent crisis with Olympus Pro, and market appreciation of some assets in the treasury, I truly believe the treasury will exceed 3 billion. Anything above that in market cap is just extra. \n\nOhm is at least backed by something, every crypto in existence has some sort of monetary premium attached to it.

Apple plans on vr by 23 and ar by 25. By 2030, I think entering a virtual reality will be extremely common. </p>\n\n<p>The question is: will these big players shut out neutral and decentralized eco systems like Ethereum? It would likely hurt their potential profits and relinquish their control which big tech doesn\u2019t like to do. I am very worried we see blockchain tech shut out or centralized (Libra) by the hardware companies as this next phase of tech will be hyper specific to hardware (like smartphones). </p>\n\n<p>Thoughts? Is this a serious risk to crypto, eth and also the metaverse?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-27 23:01:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hicl6jf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qgoyxi","parent_id":"t3_qgoyxi","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheRocketman_eth","body":"I don't think so.
