Eyes forward, my friends. \"If I'd only--\" You wouldn't. You would not have done it. You wouldn't have put that amount of money into a meme coin. You wouldn't, you didn't, it's past. I've been through this dozens of times now over the years and believe me it gets easier. Enjoy your investment and be proud of it.\n\nBTC\n\n* It's putting in the repairs. The fractal is playing out scarily accurate. There's potential for one more lower leg down based on prior patterns, so we've not escaped the $57.2k retest yet but so far so good. Closing this 4H in about 45 mins below $59085 would be a local lower low and hint at this final leg down.\n* The 4H guided me through the previous fractals and so for now it's what I'm going off of. The Stoch RSI is in a zone where it's bounced several times already. If the 4H Stoch average rolls back upward while BTC holds $58.5k, it's really good in my eyes. $58.7k even better, as that's the ATH monthly close, which is why it's been such a point of contention the past 48 hours.\n* Big milestones after the above would be retaking 60k, 61.2k, and finally testing the end of the fractal at $63.7 where it will need *another* hold across the 4H RSI.\n* If all these conditions are met, history suggests BTC could be testing $75k (as the 127.2 fib extension) by second week of November.\n\nETH - Little to say other than how proud I am it's held up the way it's been. It could make some ratio moves permitted BTC continues repairing. If this is indeed BTC's usual November drop just advanced a month, then ETHUSD gains as high as 20% are possible -- putting our expected tests of $4400, $4500, and $4800 within realistic grasp.\n\nSPY (453.94) - Cooling from this week's ATHs, equities look very healthy and bullish. It still has small gaps to fill down at 450 and 447 so it wouldn't shock me if it refueled by testing those. That'd be a great buy-in.\n\nVIX (17.04) - The volatility I expected bounced off that historic support of 15. Everything is like clockwork right now. Provided it doesn't go much beyond 18 or 18.50 while the market cools and resets, we should be in for a classic explosive November in all markets.\n\nDXY (93.86) - Luckily for us, the dollar is struggling to put in new highs. On the daily, it does appear to be rolling over and lining up a lower low. I don't expect a huge move this week while stocks chill and crypto repairs, but closing not much higher than here puts the dollar on a local downtrend. A larger downtrend could occur if it starts closing below 93.50 especially weekly and would also signal that wonderful November season.\n\nCheers!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Markets Update:</p>\n\n<p>First, a quick word.

If that is successful we\u2019ll use it to subsidize the base cost for attendees.

This is a pretty rare recipe in this space.\n\nBut, I am relentlessly biaised at this point. For a more balanced take, Logris has argued Impermax use is heavily incentivised by farming IMX itself.

There is a plan, to taper off emissions gradually (they're decreasing by roughly 5% per month, according to devs) and rely on farming rewards from other protocols. \n\nFor example, the most popular Impermax pair right now on Arbitrum is SPELL/ETH. IMX incentives on that pair are minimal. Most of the rewards come in SPELL. This is where Impermax works best, harvesting outside incentives. Leveragers get to multiply their capital and increase their gains, with the convenience of autocompounding. Lenders get high rates. The protocol gets volume and fees while spending little of its own money. IMX holders passively benefit from those fees converted into buybacks. IMX stakers doubledip and get the fruits of those buybacks.\n\nTo me, it's possible for Impermax to find equilibrium this way. \n\nThere's other venues for growth too: an upcoming lending aggregator / vault system - which would, incidentally, solve the \"what pair do i choose\" question, automatically shifting your lent assets to optimize APR. This vault system should increase lent assets liquidity, to the point it might be viable to use your lent assets on Impermax as collateral in other protocols. Similar to Maker accepting stETH for its vaults, or the Abracadabra MIM model using Yearn assets, this would allow for leveraged positions with a collateral passively increasing in value.\n\nThe token should also serve for governance at some point; which could have interesting implications similar to Curve, if Impermax can reach critical mass and if holders get to vote on incentives per pool. Turning the token into Liquidity Direction Rights, allowing for bribe markets.\n\nThis is all very speculative and from the perspective of someone with much love for the protocol (and corresponding bags). But I think objectively, there's a case to be made for throwing a bit of play money and hope for the best - and either stake or lend those IMX, to compound potential gains.
