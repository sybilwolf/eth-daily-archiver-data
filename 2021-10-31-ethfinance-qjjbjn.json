The big advantage of EVM compatiblity is to reuse code from Ethereum. However, this code was written for a very constrained environment. Now you can have new applications like gaming that were not possible. So, if they are writing these apps from scratch, might as well write them in the programming language that&#39;s most optimized (e.g. Cairo for StarkNet).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-31 12:42:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hisudzg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qjjbjn","parent_id":"t1_hisrn1p","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"So minor changes in terms of the EVM could have significant positive impact for the product that could easily pay off for the work the developers would have to do for the adaptions?
