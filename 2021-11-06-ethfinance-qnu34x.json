[Just 19 validators currently can challenge immutability of the chain, which is one of the main objectives of blockchain over a centralized database.](https://solanabeach.io/validators) Ethereum would require collusion of well over 100,000. \n\nThe fees of a blockchain are more than a user experience feature, and an economically sustainable system has revenue (fees) that cover the cost of securing the network (payments to validators). Right now, Solana is operating their chain in a way that can't  continue, with SOL token value appreciation being the only economic incentive for continued operations, and at some point they will either raise fees substantially, or be forced to exit to cover their massive centralized losses (third option is to convert to a modular execution layer secured on Ethereum).\n\nAny mass adopted monolithic L1 with any degree of decentralization will have high fees. There's not currently any way around that.

Approximately $2,000,000,000 ($2bil) of BTC is mined and sold by miners to recoup operational expenditure (lease, equipment payback, electricity etc). \n\nMany misunderstand how cut throat the forced selling mechanism under PoW is. Let's say for every $100mil miner X earns from block rewards, he is able to keep his opex down to $75 mil (so he technically doesn't have to sell $25 mil immediately, and can hodl if he's optimistic on BTC long term). What happens? Another miner can see this, and he can order *even more* advanced ASICS, or he can build his farm in an *even more* expensive electricity/lease location, and push his opex upto $85 mil for every $100 mil of block rewards. So now he is forced to sell all but 15% of the block rewards. But wait there's more! Another miner can realise \"wow wait, there's an easy $15 mil to be made on $100 mil investment here, so I am willing to pay *even more!* advanced ASICS and *even more!* costly electricity/lease. And now his opex is $95 mil, for every $100 mil in earned block rewards. Which means he market dumps 95% of block rewards to cover opex, but is still ok with that because he makes 5% in pure profit. In this way, pure market competition between miners inevitably results in this game theory optimum which tends towards maximum possible opex, and thus maximum possible miner selling and minimal hodling. \n\nWhy am I typing this out on Eth finance? Because ethereum is just as fucked under PoW tokenomics. Imagine a token like Solana, which is held 50% by insiders (VCs, founders) and a further 25% by the Solana Foundation. Most of the staking rewards go to these insiders who can collude to not sell, artificially squeezing supply. Even the retail sol holders who are staking, are not *forced* to sell to recoup opex, as staking incurs minimal external costs. (They *may* sell some if they believe the token is over valued, but that's a completely different decision to forced miner selling). In contrast, ETH under PoW, like BTC, has close to $2,000,000,000 of forced selling every month. \n\nIt's not a fair competition lol. ETH (and other PoW tokens) will be incredibly cucked by PoS tokens. The unfortunate side effect of this is that many retail, media, and institutional users use take price action as a proxy measure of project viability or project outlook. Hence, the increasing recent calls about Sol being a better Eth, Sol virtual machine being better, Sol drawing more developers etc. I believe all the above to be false, but more importantly, I see all the above pointless to refute via technical arguments. They all boil down to price action. If ETH shifts to PoS, and there's strong price action on the underlying token, all these talk about Eth killers and TPS memes would just die away. \n\nTL;DR: various ETH killer narratives won't die via technical rebuttals or pointing out logical/technical fallacies in VC narratives.

But this year I couldn\u2019t keep up with the new L2s and the new dapps. </p>\n\n<p>A year ago I even finished a solidity traning. I know how NFTs, ENS and uniswap pools are working. I know the main resons of eth2. And i have some trading knowledge so i understand margin and leverage, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I did some compund farming when it was started. I used uniswap, some other dex, and dydx (and i missed multiple airdrops unfortunately). I am staking on kraken. I have less then 16 eth.</p>\n\n<p>So that\u2019s where I am know. I didn\u2019t touch polygon, arbitrum or anything similar. Didn\u2019t even know all of them probably.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to try these chains out and also try out new dapps.
