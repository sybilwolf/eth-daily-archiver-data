On Saturday May, 23rd 2020, Solana announced on a Medium post that they only retrieved \u25ce3,365,067 $SOL tokens out of the \u25ce11,365,067 they loaned out to their Market Maker. In order to make up for the other 8m tokens they committed to burn, they released 8m tokens into circulation with out any previous announcement to the community, totally reneging on their April 28th, 2020 Medium Post. The original commitment was to remove \u25ce11,365,067 tokens FROM THE MARKET AND THAT THERE WAS NO PLANS TO INTRODUCE MORE TOKENS TO THE MARKET AND ANY PLANS WOULD BE PUBLICLY BEFORE HAND. Not only did they outright lie to everyone twice, they waited to a Saturday of a holiday weekend to dump the news. A strategy that PR Firms use to bury unflattering news while most people are not paying attention.\n\nThe new circulating supply total is now \u25ce16,350,594, not \u25ce8,258,354 that every $SOL holder was expecting for since late April. The Solana team ran a month long con on its community.

They simply just want to move on. Like the cowardice punks they are, the marketing team headed up by Austin \u201cthe weasel\u201d Virts, didn\u2019t even push the Faux Coinburn news through the Solana Announcements Telegram Channel, nor did they tweet about it from the Official Solana twitter. Its clear that they want to shine as little attention on this scam as possible. In fact if you ask them, they seem to believe that their the ones that are being inconvenienced by the con they pulled. They just want everyone to move on and focus on their \u201cbig partnership\u201d with a failed ICO who\u2019s currently being sued by the SEC they are using $SOL token investors money to pay for.\nWhat\u2019s one more lie to a pathological liar? | Source: https://t.me/solanaio/231077\n\nFrom the time of the original coinburn announcement on April 28,2020 to the Faux coinburn on May 23,2020, the price of Solana dropped as low as 40%.

Yet, on numerous occasions the Solana team assured the community that there were no plans to do so. They went on to say that the monthly release allocations were based on the amount staked. And since there were little to no coins staked, there would not be any coins released for the month of May.\nCo-Founder &amp; Duplicitous two-faced snake Raj Gokal assures the Sol Traders Telegram group on 4/27/2020 | Source: <a href=\"https://t.me/soltraders/36505\">https://t.me/soltraders/36505</a>\nSolana Sockpuppet explains that the Circulating Supply would not be doubling in May on April 27th, 2020.

On Saturday May, 23rd 2020, Solana announced on a Medium post that they only retrieved \u25ce3,365,067 $SOL tokens out of the \u25ce11,365,067 they loaned out to their Market Maker. In order to make up for the other 8m tokens they committed to burn, they released 8m tokens into circulation with out any previous announcement to the community, totally reneging on their April 28th, 2020 Medium Post. The original commitment was to remove \u25ce11,365,067 tokens FROM THE MARKET AND THAT THERE WAS NO PLANS TO INTRODUCE MORE TOKENS TO THE MARKET AND ANY PLANS WOULD BE PUBLICLY BEFORE HAND. Not only did they outright lie to everyone twice, they waited to a Saturday of a holiday weekend to dump the news. A strategy that PR Firms use to bury unflattering news while most people are not paying attention.</p>\n\n<p>The new circulating supply total is now \u25ce16,350,594, not \u25ce8,258,354 that every $SOL holder was expecting for since late April. The Solana team ran a month long con on its community. The excuses you hear now is \u201cIt\u2019s the best we could do.\u201d or that \u201cThe Total Circulating Supply is in accordance to the Binance article\u201d. They are bullshitting so badly, that their team can\u2019t even stay on the same page when questioned about the circulating supply scam.\nThis Sock Puppet says that no coins were released and calls the unannounced release the \u201cMay Allocation\u201d.

They simply just want to move on. Like the cowardice punks they are, the marketing team headed up by Austin \u201cthe weasel\u201d Virts, didn\u2019t even push the Faux Coinburn news through the Solana Announcements Telegram Channel, nor did they tweet about it from the Official Solana twitter. Its clear that they want to shine as little attention on this scam as possible. In fact if you ask them, they seem to believe that their the ones that are being inconvenienced by the con they pulled. They just want everyone to move on and focus on their \u201cbig partnership\u201d with a failed ICO who\u2019s currently being sued by the SEC they are using $SOL token investors money to pay for.\nWhat\u2019s one more lie to a pathological liar? | Source: <a href=\"https://t.me/solanaio/231077\">https://t.me/solanaio/231077</a></p>\n\n<p>From the time of the original coinburn announcement on April 28,2020 to the Faux coinburn on May 23,2020, the price of Solana dropped as low as 40%. Effectively pulling the rug out of all buyers who expected a price increase due to the upcoming reduction of circulating supply.\nSolana Rekts $SOL Holders after leading them on over the course of 4 weeks | Source: <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_BTC\">https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_BTC</a></p>\n\n<p>We reached out to Yakovenko for a comment regarding this story in which he declined.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a $SOL token holder, Do not let Solana fuck you over in silence.

They're almost always unnecessary and create a needless transaction on the blockchain. This wastes people's money and increases congestion for the rest of us. For example, I've seen multiple people cancel 1 cent offers on my nfts with a $20-40+ transaction fee that would have expired in a few days anyway. They should at least warn the user that it's unnecessary if they are expiring soon.\n\nCanceling actual listings wouldn't be a thing if they expired in a week. This would allow the seller to reprice the item without interacting with the blockchain. But by default they last 6 months. And up to a few months ago by default they were permanent listings, so there's a ton of those still up.\n\nBut maybe the worst offender is when people \"lower\" the price of their listings.

wrote a summary on DeFi 2.0\n\n**DeFi 2.0** is the idea of using bonds vs farms to incentivize liquidity (owning vs renting). This concept was pioneered by OlympusDAO $OHM and popularized by Wonderland $TIME. It is a powerful concept and I\u2019ll explain why \ud83d\udc47\n\n**First lets discuss Farming** \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf3e. Farming was popularized during DeFi Summer 2020 and is now a common practice. Users deposit liquidity into protocols to earn farming rewards. Projects then use that liquidity for swaps/lending/borrowing/etc\n\n**Whats wrong with farming?** Farming is profitable for users, but tough on projects. Farming is \u201crenting\u201d liquidity. Each day rent must be paid, and if rent stops or is uncompetitive then liquidity leaves \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8. Also most farmers don\u2019t keep farmed tokens but rather sell them.\n\n**Now lets introduce \u201cbonding\u201d**. Bonds allow projects to purchase liquidity from users. Users deposit liquidity and are paid a premium for their liquidity, paid out over a \\~7 day bond. In the end, the project keeps the liquidity, and the user has made a profit. Win-win \ud83e\udd1d\n\n**Benefits to users:** Less risk of IL & variance. With farming, users wait weeks/months \ud83d\ude34 to accrue the expected APR from farm rewards, taking risk of impermanent loss and APRs dropping. With bonding, users accrue all of the expected value within a \\~7 days, reducing those risks\n\n**Benefit to projects:** projects can now own their liquidity over time by purchasing liquidity through bonds vs giving tokens out through farming. As owned liquidity grows, the need for emissions decreases to a point where emissions could no longer be required \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**In summary**, projects continue to innovate on ways to attract liquidity. Bonding, aka DeFi 2.0, increasingly appears to be the next evolution of how projects can  incentivize liquidity.

It is a powerful concept and I\u2019ll explain why \ud83d\udc47</p>\n\n<p><strong>First lets discuss Farming</strong> \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf3e. Farming was popularized during DeFi Summer 2020 and is now a common practice. Users deposit liquidity into protocols to earn farming rewards. Projects then use that liquidity for swaps/lending/borrowing/etc</p>\n\n<p><strong>Whats wrong with farming?</strong> Farming is profitable for users, but tough on projects. Farming is \u201crenting\u201d liquidity. Each day rent must be paid, and if rent stops or is uncompetitive then liquidity leaves \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8. Also most farmers don\u2019t keep farmed tokens but rather sell them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now lets introduce \u201cbonding\u201d</strong>. Bonds allow projects to purchase liquidity from users. Users deposit liquidity and are paid a premium for their liquidity, paid out over a ~7 day bond. In the end, the project keeps the liquidity, and the user has made a profit. Win-win \ud83e\udd1d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benefits to users:</strong> Less risk of IL &amp; variance. With farming, users wait weeks/months \ud83d\ude34 to accrue the expected APR from farm rewards, taking risk of impermanent loss and APRs dropping. With bonding, users accrue all of the expected value within a ~7 days, reducing those risks</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benefit to projects:</strong> projects can now own their liquidity over time by purchasing liquidity through bonds vs giving tokens out through farming. As owned liquidity grows, the need for emissions decreases to a point where emissions could no longer be required \ud83d\udcc8</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>, projects continue to innovate on ways to attract liquidity. Bonding, aka DeFi 2.0, increasingly appears to be the next evolution of how projects can  incentivize liquidity. I encourage users, builders, and projects leads to all take a closer look</p>\n\n<p>Also posted on Twitter, retweets appreciated!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Best_coder_NA/status/1457402094202146817?s=20\">https://twitter.com/Best_coder_NA/status/1457402094202146817?s=20</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-07 09:46:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hjp6cyf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qoifvo","parent_id":"t3_qoifvo","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/newtosh","body":">  Users deposit liquidity and are paid a premium for their liquidity, paid out over a ~7 day bond.
