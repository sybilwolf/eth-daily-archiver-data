Jeez ... that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n<p>He did mention the environmental impact with disgust, too. When I told him about the merge he just started to laugh and said that one has to see if the devs will deliver it this time without a delay into eternity.</p>\n\n<p>He just wanted to end a discussion on the topic and suppress any kind of potential rational reason to invest in crypto in order to justify his decision to stick with holy ETFs.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-09 02:28:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hjx5hnt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qpx82f","parent_id":"t1_hjx4jwu","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-09 02:40:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hjx6c6b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qpx82f","parent_id":"t1_hjx5hnt","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sneakpeekbot","body":"Here's a sneak peek of /r/Buttcoin using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!\n\n\\#1: [If we are \"just as bad\" as the butters...](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/ov6i6y/if_we_are_just_as_bad_as_the_butters/)  \n\\#2: [BTC is Stealing Revenue from Gold Miners](https://i.redd.it/80ad1i0flig61.jpg) | [79 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/lgd58q/btc_is_stealing_revenue_from_gold_miners/)  \n\\#3: [Soon](https://i.redd.it/c5bj60488kk61.png) | [203 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/lvvrel/soon/)\n\n----\n^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/o8wk1r/blacklist_ix/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s a sneak peek of <a href=\"/r/Buttcoin\">/r/Buttcoin</a> using the <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year\">top posts</a> of the year!</p>\n\n<p>#1: <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/ov6i6y/if_we_are_just_as_bad_as_the_butters/\">If we are &quot;just as bad&quot; as the butters...</a><br/>\n#2: <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/80ad1i0flig61.jpg\">BTC is Stealing Revenue from Gold Miners</a> | <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/lgd58q/btc_is_stealing_revenue_from_gold_miners/\">79 comments</a><br/>\n#3: <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/c5bj60488kk61.png\">Soon</a> | <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/lvvrel/soon/\">203 comments</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><sup><sup>I&#39;m</sup></sup> <sup><sup>a</sup></sup> <sup><sup>bot,</sup></sup> <sup><sup>beep</sup></sup> <sup><sup>boop</sup></sup> <sup><sup>|</sup></sup> <sup><sup>Downvote</sup></sup> <sup><sup>to</sup></sup> <sup><sup>remove</sup></sup> <sup><sup>|</sup></sup> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot\"><sup><sup>Contact</sup></sup> <sup><sup>me</sup></sup></a> <sup><sup>|</sup></sup> <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/\"><sup><sup>Info</sup></sup></a> <sup><sup>|</sup></sup> <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/o8wk1r/blacklist_ix/\"><sup><sup>Opt-out</sup></sup></a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-09 02:40:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hjx6cte","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qpx82f","parent_id":"t1_hjx6c6b","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"If they aren't into crypto why are they going to give a fuck about the merge?
