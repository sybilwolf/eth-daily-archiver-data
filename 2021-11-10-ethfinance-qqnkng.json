The entire crypto ecosystem's value is that it takes power away from the government, which at least, has the potential of being the democratic will of the people (often not so much in practice), and gives that power to capital. The ability to regulate financial transactions and the power of the sovereign currency is slowly being ceded away.\n\nIn the situation where defi is the main financial system, regulations to stop unethical financial behaviors won't just be politically impossible because those people have lobbyists, but actually impossible from a mathematical standpoint. Due to private transactions and contracts, it will be literally be impossible to know who owns what and who is doing what.\n\nUnfortunately it's this very dynamic that makes me believe ethereum is the future. Not because it's better than the current system (which it is, in some ways regarding efficiency and connectedness) but because it takes power from the people* and gives it to capital. Fighting it's adoption isn't really a battle that could be won.\n\nAnd if it's going to win out anyway... might as well go along for the ride.

The entire crypto ecosystem&#39;s value is that it takes power away from the government, which at least, has the potential of being the democratic will of the people (often not so much in practice), and gives that power to capital. The ability to regulate financial transactions and the power of the sovereign currency is slowly being ceded away.</p>\n\n<p>In the situation where defi is the main financial system, regulations to stop unethical financial behaviors won&#39;t just be politically impossible because those people have lobbyists, but actually impossible from a mathematical standpoint. Due to private transactions and contracts, it will be literally be impossible to know who owns what and who is doing what.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately it&#39;s this very dynamic that makes me believe ethereum is the future.

Last time I checked, Arbitrum actually had similar volume:TVL, meaning you should earn roughly the same fees as main net (assuming the same range of course).  Of course these numbers are highly variable, so the best you can do is track both over time and try to project how each will track in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t really speak to maximizing LP gains for ETH-WBTC other than to say the width of the range you set represents a tradeoff between earning higher fees and suffering slightly more impermanent loss.  I.e. the narrower you set your range, the more fees you will earn, but the more IL you should expect if the price moves.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-10 06:36:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hk2lpjx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qqnkng","parent_id":"t1_hk2k122","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/HeihachiNakamoto","body":"The user experience is great on Arbitrum.

That&#39;s why I partially disagree with the prioritization of moving to PoS over sharding. (I know they&#39;re being worked on concurrently and delaying PoS doesn&#39;t necessarily mean shards get here sooner, but still.) PoW Ethereum is still more secure than any other smart contract chain, and the energy usage from a few extra years of mining is trivial in the long run. Thankfully the L2-centric roadmap seems to be moving along well.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: just remembered the many issues of sharding a PoW chain that probably make my objection wrong.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-10 13:07:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hk49btv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qqnkng","parent_id":"t1_hk3tviz","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/mild-blue-yonder","body":"Wen v shaped recovery?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wen v shaped recovery?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-10 13:37:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hk4dy0f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qqnkng","parent_id":"t3_qqnkng","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/I_AM_AN_AEROPLANE","body":"If we can just pump straight back to 4700 that\u2019d be great sir.

If one were to borrow Turkish Lira/TRYB then your debt would consistently decrease over time, and be denominated in an asset that\u2019s less volatile than crypto and potentially easier to predict changes in- the Turkish economy is doing poorly due to Erdogan\u2019s monetary policies, COVID, and inflation. It seems safer to me than borrowing in something other than a stablecoin, and risking it moving the opposite of how you want it to. </p>\n\n<p>Potentially we could also see countries in the coming years go into hyperinflation--which would essentially cancel stablecoin debts denominated in them.</p>\n\n<p>So, <a href=\"/r/EthFinance\">r/EthFinance</a>, do you know of any other currency-pegged stablecoins that could be speculated on?
