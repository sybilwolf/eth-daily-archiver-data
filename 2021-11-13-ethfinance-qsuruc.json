The exploit was a complex flashloan attack that managed to hit xSNX hard. You can read a more detailed post-mortem through the link. Ultimately due the the complexity of the contract and Synthetix' staking mechanism, xToken decided to sunset the xSNX product until further notice.\n\n[xAssetCLR launching:](https://medium.com/xtoken/introducing-xassetclr-our-efficient-exchange-framework-built-on-uniswap-v3-f7baf1c93452)\n\nOne of our favourite regulars around here, u/Logristhebard, has previously talked about xToken and their need for liquidity pools for their xAssets in their [Protocol Controlled Value](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/evolutions-in-liquidity-sourcing/) pieces. But in case you missed it or forgot, here's the rundown: xAssets are liquid staking derivatives for popular DeFi protocols, including: 1INCH, AAVE, ALPHA, BNT, KNC, and SNX (sunsetted) . Several of these protocols have mechanisms which make simply minting/burning the xAsset to enter/exit the position somewhat complex. To combat this xToken has two mechanisms 1) keeping a buffer of unstaked tokens in the contract and 2) incentivizing pairs of their xAsset against the native asset so users can get instant exit liquidity should the buffer be depleted.\n\nUnfortunately xAsset/Asset pools are subject impermanent loss and slippage due to low liquidity when using traditional AMMs. This is because an xAsset's value will continually increase relative to the native asset, ensuring impermanent loss over time. xToken designed xAssetCLR as a framework for providing liquidity to a Concentrated Liquidity Range (CLR) on these pairs using Uniswap V3. The range the xAssetCLR provides to will continually rebalance as the xAssets value increases relative to the asset, thus minimizing impermanent loss. This also means that the liquidity can be centered around the true balance of the assets, creating an effective liquidity far higher than if they provided liquidity to a traditional AMM (the magic of Uniswap V3). You can find live versions of this product for xAAVEa/AAVE, xALPHAa/ALPHA, and XTK/ETH.\n\nA generalized xAssetCLR framework will also be offered as a service under the product name 'xToken Terminal'. Allowing *any* project to quickly and easily set up pools, configure vesting periods, reward durations, and rewards rates. LPs will be able to track their positions, discover new incentive programs, and claim/vest rewards, all through xToken's easy interface.\n\n[xALPHA launches:](https://twitter.com/xtokenmarket/status/1448347786295009282?s=20)\n\nxALPHAa is an ERC20 wrapper for the ALPHA token and the Alpha Finance Protocol staking process. xALPHA is a set-and-forget token, requiring no active participation. Staking rewards and launchpad distributions are automatically re-invested in ALPHA, allowing investors to compound their ALPHA position. Holders can redeem for ALPHA or ETH at any point.\n\nNote that the 'a' in xALPHAa stands for its flavour of mandated governance. Which is xToken's *other* massive draw. And a rabbit-hole topic in and of itself. Made all the more obvious after seeing the woefully small turn out on votes from delegates of Uniswap and Compound recently. xToken takes its mandated governance role seriously and has become an active member in each of the protocols it offers xAssets for. You can find a history of their voting at [xToken.vote](https://xtoken.vote/) which chronicles what they voted on, how they voted, and sometimes even has notes on why they voted as such, describing their thought process and interpretation of how the mandate should be applied to ambiguous votes. You will also often find them polling xAsset holders in their discord for their thoughts on such occasions.\n\n[Fundraise:](https://twitter.com/xtokenmarket/status/1455970784736948232?s=20)\n\nxToken secured $2MM in funds from both old and new backers.

And a rabbit-hole topic in and of itself. Made all the more obvious after seeing the woefully small turn out on votes from delegates of Uniswap and Compound recently. xToken takes its mandated governance role seriously and has become an active member in each of the protocols it offers xAssets for. You can find a history of their voting at <a href=\"https://xtoken.vote/\">xToken.vote</a> which chronicles what they voted on, how they voted, and sometimes even has notes on why they voted as such, describing their thought process and interpretation of how the mandate should be applied to ambiguous votes. You will also often find them polling xAsset holders in their discord for their thoughts on such occasions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/xtokenmarket/status/1455970784736948232?s=20\">Fundraise:</a></p>\n\n<p>xToken secured $2MM in funds from both old and new backers.

This is where I get excited.\n\nEver since Ethereum decided to embrace the 'Rollup-centric Scaling Roadmap' I've been of the mind that every project should start to have a 'Rollup-centric Deployment Roadmap'. xToken has decided to take this approach with their next, and key (in my mind) product, xLend.\n\nxLend is a money market, that is targeting its launch on Arbitrum by Thanksgiving (Nov 25th for you fellow non-Americans). Users will initially be able to lend and borrow all your standard  assets like ETH, WBTC, LINK, SPELL (not so standard), and stables. Now you might be thinking to yourself \"CC...this isn't very exciting. That's basically 'BoomerFi' now\" and you're right. But you see, what has always gotten me excited about xLend is the ability to use all of xToken's products as collateral. xToken's productive, auto-compounding, governance participating products. Now we're sounding more like DeFi 2.0.\n\nLet's look at some examples. Like WBTC. Would you rather deposit your WBTC into the traditional money markets to use as collateral, where you typically get 0-1% interest....or would you prefer to collateralize your WBTC/renBTC based xU3LP token that's earning over 6% APR from Uniswap trading fees? How about lending out your BNT, also for basically 0% interest and giving up your governance rights....or would you prefer to collateralize your xBNTa that earns over 40% APR from the native protocol, Bancor, and will participate in governance as directed by the tokens mandated governance? For the profit maximizing degen (who still cares about governance!) in me, the choice is clear.\n\nAnother added feature of xLend is it will allow xToken to offer leveraged tokens. By combining their products and being able to give them internal protections in xLend from scamwicks, centralized oracle failures (xLend uses Chainlink price feeds) and the like, xToken believes they can safely offer tokenized leverage products such as xETH3x (move over 2xFLI), xAAVE3x, xSPELL3x, and xU3LP3x. In some cases, these are yield-generating levered strategies, where the yield can offset the cost of borrowing. Detailed info on this is scarce at the moment, but a blog post explaining the process is expected to be released in the immediate future.\n\nHowever it's not all sunshine and roses in xTokenland, there's a kink in the road ahead. xAssets are all currently staked on L1 where their respective protocols live. Bringing them to an optimistic L2 such as Arbitrum to use as collateral is no simple matter. The ability to run liquidations on the money market is significantly hampered by the 7-day withdrawal period. So until a solution for bridging xAssets is found (it's being worked on), they won't be available to use in xLend Arbitrum. Maybe current xAssets are a collateral we won't see until xLend is also launched on zkRollups, or maybe it's just a matter of time until the underlying projects also start taking the rollup-centric road and offering staking on L2. All of xToken's other productive assets on Arbitrum should be available in xLend by the end of the year though, and that, along with the future vision of xAsset collateral on xLend is still more than enough to get me going.\n\nAll this said, xToken is not completely forsaking L1 Ethereum. No. In fact there are several products in the pipeline besides xLend. For xAssets there's xUMA, xHEGIC, xPERP, and xLQTY. For liquidity strategies there are not only more xU3LP pools, but also plans of branching out into other sources of yield, like providing liquidity to dYdX, Perpetual Protocol, and Futureswap.\n\nThe future is looking bright for xToken and with all the products coming together, the flywheel will start to come into full affect.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Now for the future of xToken.
