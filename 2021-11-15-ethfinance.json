Stocks seem fine. A bit hot but last week's CPI blowout did a ton of work cooling things in the mid-term. DXY is scary as shit, breaking out above all resistances except the big poppa granddaddy mega macro long-term point at 96. It has to get rejected there. HAS TO. Or our conversations are gonna have to be very different. For now, we'll keep a wary eye on it and carry on until we can't.\n\nBut I wanna take it easy and focus on only a specific part of current crypto and that's volume shelves. And only ETH right now. BTC is weakly building a potential base as it often does in Novembers, so we'll come back to that in another day's post. No BTC, no triangles, no fractals, just ETH volume today and why I'm not worried yet.\n\n[Here's my take on a daily timescale.](https://i.imgur.com/IbnQCEt.png)\n\nOn Nov 1, we broke above $4600 on strong green volume above the average. That starts a shelf. On the most powerful recent red day Nov 9, it was both above average and beating Nov 1st's volume, but look where the price came to rest... right on the $4600 volume shelf. That's the first step to exhausting bears (and in fairness the same occurs to bulls on a downtrend).\n\nSo where do my eyes look next? A pair of things, but sticking to the volume shelf first... We're currently trading below the 4600 shelf but are below the average volume as well as below the daily volume during several key fights around the shelf. You see volume bars of approximately 150k on Nov 7, 8, and 11. (This is Coinbase, but the concept is universal save for flashes.) That's a weakening bear case and the volume level of 150k itself will act as a form of resistance, particularly as the average comes back down through it as it currently shows.\n\nBut we can't ignore the rising red volume on these last three days. Rising red is generally bad, but does need to be confirmed by breaking through at the very least the average volume and then the resistance. Both are at 150k (again, CBP) at present. Something to watch.\n\nOn our side is the StochRSI. Now, this is a derivative analysis. It holds less weight than raw, primary data. It can stay down at 0 if the metrics it's derived from continue down. It's the data counterpart to \"market can remain irrational... etc\". BUT it is still at 0, which makes it expensive both psychologically and materially for mid-term bears. You can obviously short on rising red volume. It has a good chance of paying out. But it likely won't last long especially for narrow stops. And the Stoch *average* is declining.

I wanna hear thoughts!\n\nCheers!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Easing back into things here. Stocks seem fine. A bit hot but last week&#39;s CPI blowout did a ton of work cooling things in the mid-term. DXY is scary as shit, breaking out above all resistances except the big poppa granddaddy mega macro long-term point at 96. It has to get rejected there. HAS TO. Or our conversations are gonna have to be very different. For now, we&#39;ll keep a wary eye on it and carry on until we can&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>But I wanna take it easy and focus on only a specific part of current crypto and that&#39;s volume shelves. And only ETH right now. BTC is weakly building a potential base as it often does in Novembers, so we&#39;ll come back to that in another day&#39;s post. No BTC, no triangles, no fractals, just ETH volume today and why I&#39;m not worried yet.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/IbnQCEt.png\">Here&#39;s my take on a daily timescale.</a></p>\n\n<p>On Nov 1, we broke above $4600 on strong green volume above the average. That starts a shelf. On the most powerful recent red day Nov 9, it was both above average and beating Nov 1st&#39;s volume, but look where the price came to rest... right on the $4600 volume shelf. That&#39;s the first step to exhausting bears (and in fairness the same occurs to bulls on a downtrend).</p>\n\n<p>So where do my eyes look next? A pair of things, but sticking to the volume shelf first... We&#39;re currently trading below the 4600 shelf but are below the average volume as well as below the daily volume during several key fights around the shelf. You see volume bars of approximately 150k on Nov 7, 8, and 11. (This is Coinbase, but the concept is universal save for flashes.) That&#39;s a weakening bear case and the volume level of 150k itself will act as a form of resistance, particularly as the average comes back down through it as it currently shows.</p>\n\n<p>But we can&#39;t ignore the rising red volume on these last three days. Rising red is generally bad, but does need to be confirmed by breaking through at the very least the average volume and then the resistance. Both are at 150k (again, CBP) at present. Something to watch.</p>\n\n<p>On our side is the StochRSI. Now, this is a derivative analysis. It holds less weight than raw, primary data.

It was actually only worth $990 on Friday when we won it then had a small price pump, so [ethfinance.win](https://ethfinance.win) pod holders are in the green on COMP! \ud83d\ude02\n\nThis would boost the 1.7% APR from the winnings up to \\~3.4% or so! Not too shabby. If we get another win before next June (when i started the Pod), then the APR is effectively higher.\n\nOnce gas chills out to around the 50 gwei level, i'll be happy to start doing the tx necessary as the pod manager to move these funds around and liquidate. Otherwise, they are stuck there =/\n\nAgain, i do plan to get a v4 pod going for r/ethfinance on an alternate L2 or sidechain on v4 once more tokens and chains open up on PoolTogether v4.\n\nThat being said, PoolTogether v4 is [already live with USDC on Polygon and Ethereum](https://v4.pooltogether.com/deposit).

It was actually only worth $990 on Friday when we won it then had a small price pump, so <a href=\"https://ethfinance.win\">ethfinance.win</a> pod holders are in the green on COMP! \ud83d\ude02</p>\n\n<p>This would boost the 1.7% APR from the winnings up to ~3.4% or so! Not too shabby. If we get another win before next June (when i started the Pod), then the APR is effectively higher.</p>\n\n<p>Once gas chills out to around the 50 gwei level, i&#39;ll be happy to start doing the tx necessary as the pod manager to move these funds around and liquidate. Otherwise, they are stuck there =/</p>\n\n<p>Again, i do plan to get a v4 pod going for <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a> on an alternate L2 or sidechain on v4 once more tokens and chains open up on PoolTogether v4.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, PoolTogether v4 is <a href=\"https://v4.pooltogether.com/deposit\">already live with USDC on Polygon and Ethereum</a>.

More and more shady cash grab projects will try to publish some banana smart contracts without enough auditing to attract people with the more or less subtle expectation to become an airdrop recipient as a reward for &quot;participating&quot; in their pointless contracts. Or, as an alternative, the smart contracts are actually relatively safe but there are fees associated with the &quot;participation&quot; which will go directly into the pockets of those shady cash grabbers ... just like in the ICO frenzy.</p>\n\n<p>I have the feeling that this has the potential to become the actual catalyst for an early 2018ish peak <strong>even before the merge</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As it is always the case with irrational exuberance ... well ... it will end in a very harsh crash. There will be contract exploits all over the place and people will start to question where their fees (~ ICO money) will be &quot;invested&quot; in. The airdrop hunting hype will fade and quite some people will burn their fingers.</p>\n\n<p>And to be absolutely clear: <strong>This doesn&#39;t mean that airdrops are bad in general, hell no! But one has to be aware that malicious actors will be attracted by more normie attention!</strong></p>\n\n<p>RemindMe! 9 months &quot;Airdrops 2021/22 = ICOs 2017/18?&quot;</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-15 04:54:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkpq6r5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qu9jyy","parent_id":"t3_qu9jyy","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Airdrops aren't putting nearly as much eth into the hands of dumpers as ICOs did","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Airdrops aren&#39;t putting nearly as much eth into the hands of dumpers as ICOs did</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-15 06:40:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkq2i6z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qu9jyy","parent_id":"t1_hkpq6r5","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Heringsalat100","body":"It isn't exactly like the ICO bubble and it does have some differences but the mechanisms which can lead to a mania and a crash are there:\n\n1.

They are by definition, wallet agnostic.

Yesterday I tried playing around with zkSync. I got stuck while trying to mint an NFT. Fortunately, u/interweaver helped me get past the part where I had to upload the image to IPFS, and then one of the zkSync Discord members helped me \"see\" the minted NFT.\n\n  \nSo, I put together a short \"how-to\" for all the non-very-technical\u00a0people like me, who might struggle a bit around these steps:\n\n  \nStep 1) Go to\u00a0https://wallet.zksync.io/account and click on NFTs.\n\n  \nStep 2) On a separate browser tab, go to:\u00a0https://anarkrypto.github.io/upload-files-to-ipfs-from-browser-panel/public/ \n\nCopy the long string of letters from the \"Response IPFS API\" box and paste it into\u00a0the \"Content Address\" box of Step 1.  \n\n\n*(side note: as Interveaver\u00a0told me, \"uploading through a public portal like that doesn't guarantee that your file will stay on someone's IPFS node for any duration of time whatsoever. But your same file will always, always produce the same IPFS hash, so it doesn't really matter if it becomes inaccessible as long as you still have the file locally, and can re-upload it in the future when you do have your own IPFS node and can pin it\")*\n\n  \nStep 3: Proceed with the requested transactions, in order to mint the NFT... After the\u00a0transactions\u00a0are processed, you'll have to wait for the NFT to get minted. This might take a long time, I assume depending on the size (?) of the image you uploaded. On the\u00a0zkSync\u00a0Discord, they told me that \"*The max amount of time for your minting tx to be fully verified is 7 hours*\". \u00a0Note that if you follow the\u00a0transaction\u00a0link on\u00a0zkSync\u00a0explorer, you'll see the Minting Status go from \"Initiated\" to \"Pending\" to \"Complete\". Again, this process might take hours, but you will get to the finish line!\n\n  \nStep 4: Now, to \"see\" the NFT as an image, I had to ask around in the\u00a0zkSync\u00a0Discord again... Do the following:\n\n  \n1. Take\u00a0your content hash of your NFT. ex. 0x....\u00a0\n\n2. Go to [https://content-hash.surge.sh/](https://content-hash.surge.sh/)\u00a0\n\n3. In the \"Decode Content Hash\" section, enter your NFT content hash\n\n4. Replace the 0x of your content hash with e30101701220\n\n5. Decode\n\n6. Now you have the CID. You can click the link provided (of the CID) and then it will give you a string with https://ipfs.io/ipfs/xxx...\u00a0 You\u00a0can copy that into your browser to actually see your image!\n\n  \nThe end! You can now either move the NFT to L1 Ethereum (which will cost you a lot in fees) or just keep it on\u00a0zkSync.  \nI hope this helps!
