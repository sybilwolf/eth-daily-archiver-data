The core of Defi is incentive alignment. Each necessary actor must be rewarded fairly for their contribution. Amongst necessary actors we generally have:\n\n* Users. This encompasses traders in Dex's, lenders and borrowers in money markets, etc. These are basically the source of your revenue for everyone else.\n\n* Devs. Programmers are pricey but without them you're ngmi. These guys usually get the first cut and act on salary.\n\n* Voters. Without them the DAO doesn't function. (Yes, this means you UNI).\n\n* Insurers. I'm [writing more](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qtjebc/daily_general_discussion_november_14_2021/hkk2pcn) about this now.\n\n* LP's. Not all DAO's require this but those that do pay heavily.\n\nOver time I expect DAO's to evolve towards reward structures that more directly rewards these five functions. Today several of these roles are either unrewarded, non-existent, or rewarded in unsustainable ways. I've [already written](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/evolutions-in-liquidity-sourcing) about changes to LP incentives so I'll be skipping that for now.\n\nThere's not much to say on the user or dev front, therefore let's start with voting. What do we want from a voting system? In my opinion, we want intelligent, rational, informed people to get together and make decisions on the important issues of the day without being able to collude to dishonest ends. The latter part is why we care about voter participation. The more participants the harder it is to collude. The answer to voter participation is to pay voters for voting. The reason DAOs like Curve have high voter participation is because they have a bribe system attached to their voting system. Pay people for voting and they show up. That much is simple. What is much harder is getting useful rather than random vote results. Getting rational voting outcomes requires that voters carry tranched responsibility for the outcomes of their votes.\n\nThis leads us to the topic of insurance. There are many things you can insure against. You could argue developers should carry insurance against hacks for the same reason doctors carry insurance against mal-practice. In the absence of that staked assets and treasury reserve assets are the lender of last resort in the event of a hack. Aave and Alchemix are both designed for this. To get the protocol revenue you have to stake. If you stake you are acting as a tranche of insurance. If you require assets to be staked to vote, you lower participation but increase engagement of those who do vote. It's a tough thing to balance but one we have to navigate as an industry.\n\nIn a well-designed tokenomic flow competent voters should gain net influence over the DAO over time. There's an interesting mechanism being developed by UMA right now called KPI's that could be used as part of a voting system. Conceptually, you can make each vote trade the underlying tokens/vote influence for a KPI. After some time the KPI is redeemable depending on how the system behaved. Those who voted for a good change can redeem the KPI for more tokens. Those who voted for a bad change effectively get slashed. A simple example might be to allow the voters to vote in each code change. If a hack occurs before the KPI expires then the KPI is redeemed for less than they put in. If no hack occurs you get paid for being a voter via the KPI.\n\nTo summarize I think we're going to see three general changes to governance tokens.\n\n1) Voters will be paid for voting.\n\n2) Voters will have to bond some type of reserve asset in order to vote.\n\n3) Voters will be accountable for the outcomes of their votes via their bond.\n\nThe bond part implies that assets become locked in Defi as part of being a voter. This makes the bonded assets (commonly the governance tokens) a smooth Lego. Now, if you're paying attention there is one Defi protocol out there that turns that smooth lego back into a Defi Lego. If you buy into the argument of this trend, it implies there will be tens of billions of AUM drawn to this protocol over time. I'll let you guess where I'm going with this.\n\nEdit: Btw this is one I'd appreciate some engagement on before I go down a rabbit hole no one agrees with.

There are many things you can insure against. You could argue developers should carry insurance against hacks for the same reason doctors carry insurance against mal-practice. In the absence of that staked assets and treasury reserve assets are the lender of last resort in the event of a hack. Aave and Alchemix are both designed for this. To get the protocol revenue you have to stake. If you stake you are acting as a tranche of insurance. If you require assets to be staked to vote, you lower participation but increase engagement of those who do vote. It&#39;s a tough thing to balance but one we have to navigate as an industry.</p>\n\n<p>In a well-designed tokenomic flow competent voters should gain net influence over the DAO over time. There&#39;s an interesting mechanism being developed by UMA right now called KPI&#39;s that could be used as part of a voting system. Conceptually, you can make each vote trade the underlying tokens/vote influence for a KPI. After some time the KPI is redeemable depending on how the system behaved. Those who voted for a good change can redeem the KPI for more tokens. Those who voted for a bad change effectively get slashed. A simple example might be to allow the voters to vote in each code change. If a hack occurs before the KPI expires then the KPI is redeemed for less than they put in. If no hack occurs you get paid for being a voter via the KPI.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize I think we&#39;re going to see three general changes to governance tokens.</p>\n\n<p>1) Voters will be paid for voting.</p>\n\n<p>2) Voters will have to bond some type of reserve asset in order to vote.</p>\n\n<p>3) Voters will be accountable for the outcomes of their votes via their bond.</p>\n\n<p>The bond part implies that assets become locked in Defi as part of being a voter. This makes the bonded assets (commonly the governance tokens) a smooth Lego. Now, if you&#39;re paying attention there is one Defi protocol out there that turns that smooth lego back into a Defi Lego. If you buy into the argument of this trend, it implies there will be tens of billions of AUM drawn to this protocol over time. I&#39;ll let you guess where I&#39;m going with this.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Btw this is one I&#39;d appreciate some engagement on before I go down a rabbit hole no one agrees with. So comment!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-15 22:11:02","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-11-15 22:28:21","id":"hktmyep","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qv0zrj","parent_id":"t3_qv0zrj","score":47,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CosmicCollusion","body":">To summarize I think we're going to see three general changes to governance tokens.  \n>  \n>1.

When it&#39;s showing you the amount of Eth you&#39;re sending, or the address/smart contract you&#39;re sending to/interacting with, that is 100% guaranteed to be the thing you&#39;re signing, no funny business.</p>\n\n<p>So it&#39;s literally impossible for any external software to exfiltrate your private key from the secure enclave, because there is no way to input a command to do that (because it can only be passed basically a blob of data to sign), and no way for the secure enclave to output the private key (because it can only output a signature for the blob of data).</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, you&#39;re completely safe connecting MM to a Ledger and using it to sign.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-16 18:10:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkxov5a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qv0zrj","parent_id":"t1_hkx2oss","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/stripedgreywallpaper","body":"what thread? pls link","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>what thread? pls link</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-16 15:45:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkx528u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qv0zrj","parent_id":"t1_hkx2oss","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/MoneyPrinterGoBrbrrr","body":"thanks everyone!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>thanks everyone!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-17 00:47:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkytk41","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qv0zrj","parent_id":"t1_hkx2oss","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"We\u2019re not dropping below 3500 this year","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>We\u2019re not dropping below 3500 this year</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-16 05:21:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkulzjz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qv0zrj","parent_id":"t3_qv0zrj","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Heringsalat100","body":"Mooooom, he is doing it again!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Mooooom, he is doing it again!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-16 05:39:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkuo2c8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qv0zrj","parent_id":"t1_hkulzjz","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"\ud83d\ude09","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\ud83d\ude09</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-16 05:43:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkuojyf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qv0zrj","parent_id":"t1_hkuo2c8","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"These kinds of proclamations always hold up well.\n\nRemindMe! 46 days","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>These kinds of proclamations always hold up well.</p>\n\n<p>RemindMe! 46 days</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-16 05:29:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkumvrh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qv0zrj","parent_id":"t1_hkulzjz","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Obviously, but it\u2019s more fun to have a take","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Obviously, but it\u2019s more fun to have a take</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-16 05:42:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkuohmv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qv0zrj","parent_id":"t1_hkumvrh","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Mhotdemnot","body":"Just a FYI when we were dumping in the summer he kept saying we won't close above 2.5k for the entire year.
