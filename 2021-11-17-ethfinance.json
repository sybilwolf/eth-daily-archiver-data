Exciting times. </p>\n\n<p>This comment will either be Alpha, or the sharing of a shitcoin. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cap.finance/\">Cap finance</a> is a leverage trading platform on Arbitrum. V2 has had some bugs, while its stated that a position in profit cannot be paid out immediately in the event that there is insufficient balance in the treasury, the release margin function was buggy and thus left people stranded in open positions they wished to close. People had the shits - rightfully so. </p>\n\n<p>Well, according to their telegram moderators V3 will be coming out within the next week. With this, over the coming weeks we can expect Cap to launch on Avax, BSC, FTM, ZK and optimism, staking is said to be live on multiple chains as is LPing. Fees from the protocol are distributed to both. \nThere are no VCs involved, they have a for the people by the people vibe.</p>\n\n<p>So what makes them different or superior to DYDX you ask? Well, they&#39;re the new and shiny thing. </p>\n\n<p>Their current market cap is 27 million, with an FDV of 33 million. Their UI is nice and simple. Alpha, or shitcoin? We will find out in time.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-17 19:00:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hl2nznb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qvsj0t","parent_id":"t3_qvsj0t","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stablecoin","body":"Low cap altcoin, strong community, announcment of an upgrade, multi-chain launch scheduled....sonofabitch this is the alpha I come for!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Low cap altcoin, strong community, announcment of an upgrade, multi-chain launch scheduled....sonofabitch this is the alpha I come for!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-17 19:09:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hl2p3io","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qvsj0t","parent_id":"t1_hl2nznb","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/wanderingcryptowolf","body":"Haha, I do my best.

Which is one way to look at it, but on the other hand, that&#39;s a significant amount for a lot of people. I wonder how many billions of dollars of people&#39;s money is actually stuck in this manner? </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s easy to consider that collateral damage in Ethereum&#39;s quest for scaling, and I&#39;m okay with that if it means we can achieve true scaling with L2s on an accelerated timescale, but it does feel concerning to me as well. All (well, most of...) the people we&#39;re seeing complaining about gas are doing so because they don&#39;t have very much money, and their small amounts are no longer economical to move. That&#39;s a very fair complaint, even if it&#39;s one we&#39;ve seen so many darn times. For new people, of course, the solution is just to use L2s, but for those who were already using the network with their $10 and $20 and $50 and $100 worth of ERC20s or whatever, they&#39;re stuck, and I wish we could think of something helpful.
