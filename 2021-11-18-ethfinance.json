Yield bearing, composable, credibly neutral, no counterparty risk, etc. As such, it\u2019s likely to hold a strong position in DeFi. Why hold ETH when you can make it yield bearing? Over time treasuries (for example) will have an obligation to do this.\n2. rETH is more L2-compatible and tax-efficient than stETH.\n3. ETH is going to $20k. Staking (+ derivatives) is going to grow to a huge % of the ETH supply. Just facts. The TAM here is gigantic.\n4. RPL is effectively a leveraged form of ETH where the amount of leverage depends on adoption. RPL/rETH is the \\*only\\* thing I would trade my ETH for in this environment.\n5. Because of the mechanics for how RPL is used as an insurance collateral, it locks a huge amount of RPL and removes them from circulation. This is effectively permanent. The only ways to withdraw your RPL are either a) if you\u2019re >150% collateralized or b) post-merge when withdrawals are enabled. A good bet on a supply squeeze.\n6. Integrations. TBD, but this is the ace in the sleeve. What happens if Consensus integrates 1-click staking into MM? Or a CEX like Gemini decides to partner? Nothing but upside here.\n\nThe tokenomics for both of these assets is pure \\*chefs kiss\\*.

Yield bearing, composable, credibly neutral, no counterparty risk, etc. As such, it\u2019s likely to hold a strong position in DeFi. Why hold ETH when you can make it yield bearing? Over time treasuries (for example) will have an obligation to do this.</li>\n<li>rETH is more L2-compatible and tax-efficient than stETH.</li>\n<li>ETH is going to $20k. Staking (+ derivatives) is going to grow to a huge % of the ETH supply. Just facts. The TAM here is gigantic.</li>\n<li>RPL is effectively a leveraged form of ETH where the amount of leverage depends on adoption. RPL/rETH is the *only* thing I would trade my ETH for in this environment.</li>\n<li>Because of the mechanics for how RPL is used as an insurance collateral, it locks a huge amount of RPL and removes them from circulation. This is effectively permanent. The only ways to withdraw your RPL are either a) if you\u2019re &gt;150% collateralized or b) post-merge when withdrawals are enabled.
