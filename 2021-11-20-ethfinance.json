Fees from trading + LM rewards. Automated by Yearn, Convex, etc.\n\n3) Insurance. Fees from staking in which your money is a backstop against lost funds from users e.g. Aave, Alchemix v2.\n\n4) Voting. Fees given to active voter participants e.g. KNC.\n\nOf these there are numerous platforms devoted to the first two, a few Defi 1.0 protocols that apply internal implementations of insurance, and barely anything for voting. XToken at its core is a platform that automates and auto-compounds insurance and governance yields. As Yearn and Tokemak are to liquidity, XToken is to insurance + governance.\n\nI view it as inevitable that over time we see more and more platforms adopting the Alchemix and Aave model where staked funds provide insurance. I think we'll also see the rise of bonded voting as a direct source of yield for voter participation. These are necessary services for DAOs, yet today insurance and voting are either unrewarded, non-existent, or dysfunctional. Given that I view this as an inevitable trend and that there is only one platform I'm aware of even attempting to solve it, it's probably worth having a closer look at it. So, here's a deep dive into how [XToken](https://twitter.com/xtokenmarket) works, what their plans are, and where I see them going.\n\n**Delegated Voting**\n\nTo start with, let's talk about delegated voting today. Our ecosystem's solution to this is entirely inadequate. Outside of a few notable DAOs like Curve, voter participation is an abject failure. There are only really two good solutions to this:\n\n1) Pay voters.\n\n2) Delegation.\n\nI have a separate post I'm writing about futarchy governance mechanisms but let's consider the problems with delegation today. First, not every DAO supports delegated voting and even when they do the implementation is often inconsistent. Second, for some DAOs being able to vote requires locking your funds. Worse still, this lock doesn't even always return an LP token. The result is a smooth Defi Lego that loses composability with the rest of the ecosystem. Third, even when there is an LP the moment you try to use it in Defi the delegated voting power is lost. For example, if you delegate your vote with your governance tokens and then put them into a Uniswap LP, does the delegated vote still apply? What happens when someone buys them? Does your delegate status carry over? How about if you deposit them to Compound and someone borrows them? These are critical problems for Defi that XToken is aiming to solve. They do this by providing a separation of concern between the capital and the voting power behind it through their xAsset system.\n\n**xAssets**\n\nWhen you deposit governance assets to XToken you receive an xAsset. Functionally this is equivalent to something like cETH. xAssets are interest bearing  because they collect and compound staking and voting rewards.\n\nSo how do they separate their capital value from their voting power? Well, the xAsset is worth however much of the underlying asset you can claim is worth. This is enforced by arbitrage. This keeps the capital power of your governance token in your control as long as you control the xAsset and it can either be redeemed or sold. Meanwhile, the underlying governance asset is actively managed in a voting contract. The trick to delegation when delegation isn't actually supported by a protocol is to grant voting access to tokens via a function call without granting withdrawal access by the voter.\n\nThis leads us to the question of who directs the voting power of those assets. At the moment they use this abstract \"mandate\" system. By abstract I mean there's no way to objectively, deductively go from the mandate to a vote for every single issue. At some point there is a trusted person like a courtroom judge who has to interpret the mandate (law) and vote according to it. While I haven't encountered any controversial votes by the XToken team I think the mere presence of this trusted entity implies an inevitable endgame with known celebrity \"Defi Senators\" acting as voters instead of the XToken team. Their objection when I've asked about this is it would fragment liquidity amongst numerous xAssets (e.g. xKNCa, xKNCb). However, it's possible to combine multiple delegates under the same xAsset. To do this they add a step when you mint your xToken to delegate your voting power to a particular voter. The pooled tokens are then split into a separate deposit addresses per delegate and the voting power is retained by that delegate until the xAsset moves to another externally owned account (EOA). If there's ever ambiguity on where the voting power should reside the tokens can be moved to a backstop address that votes according to the existing mandate (XToken team's directive). It's a simple manageable change in my opinion, and one well worth pursuing.\n\nSo where does the income come from that makes xAssets interest bearing? Well, from the DAO of the governance token in some form. The most common form of this income at the moment is staking as a protocol insurer in exchange for a share of the protocols revenue. However, tokens like KNC already directly tie protocol rewards to voting and nothing makes these two revenue streams mutually exclusive. How much revenue are we talking about here? It varies by protocol obviously, but for reference xAAVEa is at about 5% meanwhile xBNTa is currently clocking in at 52% APY. At 52% passive APY an asset doesn't have to go up by much in order to be worth holding. It just needs to not go *down*.\n\n**xAssetCLR**\n\nOften enough, when tokens are earning staking/voting revenue those tokens are time locked into a staking contract. This prevents everyone from exiting if a hack occurs and frontrunning the DAO selling their assets (you know, as part of actually being an insurance provider). Under more normal conditions however, xAssets have the benefit of instant exit liquidity. This comes in two flavors, the first being small percent of the deposited funds held in reserve for withdrawals. The second being xAssetCLR pools. While the name is fancy, it's just a managed Uniswap v3 pool that contains the xAsset and the base asset, e.g. xBNTa/BNT, and they manipulate the range on that pool to retain a desired balance between them, e.g. 25%/75%. So why does someone provide liquidity to this pool and forfeit 75% of the revenue they would have for just holding more of the xAsset? Short answer, liquidity mining.\n\nThis leads to the interesting question: how does insurance work when you can exit with your capital before the DAO can liquidate your staked assets? That's quite a conundrum. Who actually loses money? Who is actually the insurer? Well, there's a bit of a race condition.\n\n1) Anyone who is in the xAssetCLR pool is essentially buying the xAsset and selling the (unstaked) governance asset. This will quickly deplete the liquidity on the xAssetCLR pool. The LPs that don't remove their liquidity from Uniswap in a hurry are the ones actually serving as insurance.\n\n2) Next your base xAsset holders and any CLR LPs who are fast enough to exit their positions now have xAssets they need to hot potato. They can either sell into any remaining liquidity to get the base asset or they can redeem the xAsset using the reserve.\n\n3) Anyone still holding an xAsset when the reserve depletes and Uniswap v3 range liquidity depletes is stuck holding the bag just like if their funds were staked directly. Sucks to suck.\n\nThe good news is holding an xAsset at least gave you *a chance* unlike directly staking.  This opens the door for another layer of xAsset manager to hold your xAsset in escrow and who is prepared 24/7 for hacks to occur to race to the exists before you, dear bagholder, are affected.\n\nNow obviously, these are some big risks being taken by the CLR LP's. Commensurate with that are outsized rewards. Typical staking rewards are in the 5-10% range. The xAlphaCLR pool is currently providing, checks notes, 199% APR. Someone dilute that already, that's ridiculous.\n\nEdit: [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qyoign/daily_general_discussion_november_21_2021/hlh9h6u/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>When you get right down to it there are only a few sources of yield in Defi.</p>\n\n<p>1) Lending. e.g. Compound, Aave.</p>\n\n<p>2) Liquidity.

While the name is fancy, it&#39;s just a managed Uniswap v3 pool that contains the xAsset and the base asset, e.g. xBNTa/BNT, and they manipulate the range on that pool to retain a desired balance between them, e.g. 25%/75%. So why does someone provide liquidity to this pool and forfeit 75% of the revenue they would have for just holding more of the xAsset? Short answer, liquidity mining.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to the interesting question: how does insurance work when you can exit with your capital before the DAO can liquidate your staked assets? That&#39;s quite a conundrum. Who actually loses money? Who is actually the insurer? Well, there&#39;s a bit of a race condition.</p>\n\n<p>1) Anyone who is in the xAssetCLR pool is essentially buying the xAsset and selling the (unstaked) governance asset. This will quickly deplete the liquidity on the xAssetCLR pool. The LPs that don&#39;t remove their liquidity from Uniswap in a hurry are the ones actually serving as insurance.</p>\n\n<p>2) Next your base xAsset holders and any CLR LPs who are fast enough to exit their positions now have xAssets they need to hot potato. They can either sell into any remaining liquidity to get the base asset or they can redeem the xAsset using the reserve.</p>\n\n<p>3) Anyone still holding an xAsset when the reserve depletes and Uniswap v3 range liquidity depletes is stuck holding the bag just like if their funds were staked directly. Sucks to suck.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is holding an xAsset at least gave you <em>a chance</em> unlike directly staking.  This opens the door for another layer of xAsset manager to hold your xAsset in escrow and who is prepared 24/7 for hacks to occur to race to the exists before you, dear bagholder, are affected.</p>\n\n<p>Now obviously, these are some big risks being taken by the CLR LP&#39;s. Commensurate with that are outsized rewards. Typical staking rewards are in the 5-10% range. The xAlphaCLR pool is currently providing, checks notes, 199% APR. Someone dilute that already, that&#39;s ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qyoign/daily_general_discussion_november_21_2021/hlh9h6u/\">Part 2</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-19 22:18:17","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-11-21 10:29:17","id":"hlcw2zf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qxz754","parent_id":"t3_qxz754","score":67,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/towerjac","body":"Another Logris post saved.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Another Logris post saved.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-19 22:32:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlcxa6a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qxz754","parent_id":"t1_hlcw2zf","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Hanzburger","body":"Saved to read later and unfortunately never get around to it","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Saved to read later and unfortunately never get around to it</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-19 22:52:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlcywk1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qxz754","parent_id":"t1_hlcxa6a","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"Saved to read later, what time zone are you in my guy haha","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Saved to read later, what time zone are you in my guy haha</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-19 23:00:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlczgfv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qxz754","parent_id":"t1_hlcw2zf","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethacct","body":"Logris sleeps in 3 hour rotating cycles as part of his opsec to throw off anyone who might be trying to track him down.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Logris sleeps in 3 hour rotating cycles as part of his opsec to throw off anyone who might be trying to track him down.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-20 01:37:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hldan1q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qxz754","parent_id":"t1_hlczgfv","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CosmicCollusion","body":"Did you just assume Logris' gender?  \n\nGet 'em mods!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Did you just assume Logris&#39; gender?  </p>\n\n<p>Get &#39;em mods!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-20 03:45:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hldjoll","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qxz754","parent_id":"t1_hldan1q","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/CosmicCollusion","body":">Now obviously, these are some big risks being taken by the CLR LP's.

It\u2019s important that people educated on the matter publicly push back on this narrative that seems to have finally taken hold with Solana. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important that these players who want to see control of the digital world in the hands of a small group also fight back publicly so they can convince people that it\u2019s perfectly fine and the network will become decentralized later as hardware gets better. </p>\n\n<p>If your only interest in Ethereum or blockchain is to make money, this isn\u2019t a fight you should care about, but if you\u2019re worried about the long-term digital freedom of people, you should be willing to call out others who are misinformed or knowingly misleading, so you can ensure that people understand how much they\u2019re giving away by using a chain without sound security principals and no recourse if they get censored.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-20 06:04:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hldwcsz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qxz754","parent_id":"t1_hld66mg","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"Beef marketing works.

So far decentralization is what sticks in this ecosystem. Look at CMC top 10 from 2013, 2015, 2017, 2020, etc., only the same 2 coins really are on top of the list the longest.
