If you do your homework and look hard enough you will see where they fall. There are multiple well intentioned projects out there with differing opinions, but many won't endure.

Many folks here have survived the long haul and have historically been pretty correct about the directions of both technological and market trends.

This makes the pair unsuitable for Curve. But these pools would also be a poor fit for Balancer or Uniswap v2 because their x\\*y=k model would severely underutilize the liquidity they\u2019re paying for. This is really where Uniswap v3 shines and that\u2019s why the CLR pools were built on it. XToken built is an active liquidity management system just like [Visor](https://www.visor.finance/). They rebalance the price range on the Uniswap v3 position periodically to keep the balance of assets in alignment and ensure there is liquidity in both directions. Then, since they had to build this *anyway* they might as well offer a managed solution for simple like-kind asset pairs on Uniswap v3. Basically they built a Curve style system on Uniswap v3. That\u2019s xU3LP: xToken Uniswap v3 Liquidity Provider. It was a gap in the market they took an opportunistic grab at that in my opinion is greatly underappreciated.\n\nSeriously, the yields here are higher than they have any right to be. Take the xU3LPc pool which tries to keep a 1:1 parity of sUSD and USDC. It\u2019s basically $ exposure, has been making 9.14% on *trading volume* which about triple what Compound offers on stablecoin lending, and then has an LM program offering 29% on top. Over 35% APR on without price volatility risk? Mmmff. You can\u2019t see it but I\u2019m biting my lower lip because that\u2019s so **sexy**. The next best thing I\u2019m aware of in that category is Convex MIM which is at 19.14% on mainnet or the Pickle farm at 26.02% on Arbitrum for those who want auto-compounding. Unimpressed? Want ETH price exposure? How about 23% APR for an ETH/sETH pair? As I said, underappreciated.\n\nUnlike the xAssets, these have no governance rights. They just built it because it was low hanging fruit, an easy extension of something they did have to build that brings in additional revenue.\n\nThat brings us to the point of revenue and the XTK token itself. The XTK token is one of those staked governance/insurance tokens I keep mentioning (so meta). You get paid to insure the protocol against future hacks. So where does the revenue come from for that?\n\n1) A 1-3% fee on compounding harvests.\n\n2) A 0.2% mint fee on xAsset creation.\n\n3) A 0.2% burn fee on xAsset redemption.\n\nOverall quite fair compared to Yearn\u2019s 20% fee on compounding gains + 2% principal per year or Harvests 30% fee on compounding gains. Despite the low fees there\u2019s currently a 15.64% APR going to XTK stakers from those rewards. This is in addition to the LM rewards of 52%. A 15% staking APR is a damn promising start to any ecosystem if it can be sustained.\n\nI\u2019d like to emphasize here that you are accepting risk as a protocol insurer for this revenue. XToken has already been hacked, *twice*. It\u2019s not the greatest track record tbh. While there\u2019s a lot of things here I think are worth paying attention to, buyer beware. The price is down 95% from the high because of these hacks and there is no guarantee going forward. While they\u2019ve acted honorably to those who lost funds in the past, their staking module wasn\u2019t online when the last hacks happened. This time XTK stakers are explicitly on the line instead of the XToken DAO treasury.\n\nIn terms of risk isolation as an insurer, staking in XTK is based on module. Everything discussed above is under the xToken management module. As they build out their vertically integrated stack (discussed soon) you\u2019ll be able to isolate your risk as an insurer to particular parts of the system.\n\nThat roughly brings us up to present day. Let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s up and coming. XLend is their answer to the equivalent of Impermax. They are creating their own money market that will allow xAsset holders to take loans using their xAssets, either for regular borrowing or to take leveraged positions with price exposure to other assets like ETH. The primary advantage of making your own money market is you get to set the rules. In this case, they seem to be planning to do something special with the liquidation mechanics. I don\u2019t have the full details, but I thought it was worth mentioning. On the surface it feels like they\u2019re playing with gasoline here, but I\u2019ll withhold judgement until they post the full details.\n\nWith that out of the way I\u2019d like to provide some context on Defi 2.0 lending protocols. If you\u2019ve been living under a rock recently Alchemix v2 and Abracadabra are differentiated from their predecessors in that they enable loans using interest interest bearing collateral, enabling greater capital efficiency for users. In Alchemix v2 (lovingly called Altchemix) they\u2019re going to be adding more alAssets and supporting different collateral assets including interest bearing assets like rETH and Curve LPs. Similarly the recent success of Abracadabra can largely be attributed to the fact that users can generate loans using collateral such as yvSTETH and cvx3pool. As I point out above, xAssets are a new class of interest bearing asset. I don\u2019t see xAssets on Abracadabra yet, but why not? As long as the liquidity depth for the xAsset is sufficient for liquidations it should be fine. Similarly, if Alchemix is accepting a Curve sETH/ETH position as collateral for alETH, why not an equivalent managed Uniswap v3 LP token? That plus the xLend program should create a lot more demand for the xAssets which I find exciting for a protocol that is already probably undervalued due to hacks.\n\nI\u2019ll just briefly list out some more things without expounding. They\u2019re apparently getting into creating xAssets for real estate, there\u2019s an NFT platform in development, a slew of new xAsset and xU3LP options, more staking modules, and a recent $2M fundraise to pay for continued development. They seem intent on powering through their previous mistakes and have respectable grit.\n\nIf I had one criticism of the XToken team it\u2019s that they seem intent on doing everything themselves. Vertically integrated is synonymous with do everything yourself. Unlike most successful Defi protocols they haven\u2019t focused on forming partnerships. Rather than work with Visor, they made xU3LP. Rather than make a Rari fuse pool they are making xLend. There are protocols that enable leveraged trading already but they are aiming to do it in xLend themselves. I haven\u2019t seen outreach with Abracadabra to get xAssets added there. I haven\u2019t seen outreach to Alchemix but maybe it would be premature. I only recently saw them reach out to Olympus DAO to setup bonds for their XTK/ETH pair and no mention of bonds for the CLR pool liquidity. The result of this shows in their adoption. Partnerships aren\u2019t just to reduce work, they serve as a form of outreach to other communities, effectively marketing, and create those (3,3) relationships that bring more people on board both protocols. This recent marketing push of theirs that motivated me to write all of this (Threadoor) is a great opportunity to reach out to *them* if you see opportunity for collaboration. At the end of the day, there is no one else trying to serve the niche they are. It\u2019s an essential product that addresses a major failure of this ecosystem to date.

So if staking is &quot;easy&quot; then it also needs to be &quot;easy&quot; to run a node, otherwise the network will become more centralized than it could be</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-21 10:03:45","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-11-21 10:09:30","id":"hljamy9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qyoign","parent_id":"t1_hlj5379","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/mistrustless","body":"Gas prices are an auction for limited block space, so not related to mining costs.\n\nCompensating miners is all about security, so benefits of PoS are rather better security with less issuance.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Gas prices are an auction for limited block space, so not related to mining costs.</p>\n\n<p>Compensating miners is all about security, so benefits of PoS are rather better security with less issuance.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-21 09:38:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlj6yhi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qyoign","parent_id":"t1_hlj5379","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/lops21","body":"How cheap it is to operate has nothing to do with gas price.
