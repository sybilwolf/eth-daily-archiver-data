Thought I'd share some thoughts on it for everyone curious about staking or interested in the user experience from an investment in RPL perspective:\n\nFirst off, 16 ETH plus my around 950 RPL is most of my portfolio, so while I haven't been nervous using DeFi in a long time it was a little nerve wracking to unwind and consolidate my portfolio. Had most of it split between 3 wallets. MM (hotwallet), Argent Wallet (used to be a mix of DeFi and higher security before gas prices rose, now mostly just secure storage) and Ledger (mostly secure storage, mostly old coins I don't use too often). Moved everything to MM hotwallet because Ledger SW always gives me headaches and didn't want to risk it not working right when interacting with the staking contract, so there was a bit of risk that someone could've compromised my MM hotwallet and been waiting for it to have more funds to be worth stealing. Thought it was pretty unlikely and it worked out fine but did have a bit of jitters.\n\nIt was also super expensive to unwind and consolidate everything ontop of the gas costs to register and launch the node. Sent ETH from Coinbase, Argent, and Ledger to MM as well as RPL from Argent, and then withdrew some excess collateral from Liquity, and lastly sent some stETH to the MM and swapped that for ETH. Registering the node took maybe 4 more transactions after that (including swapping RPL v1 to v2), and the main step in registering the node cost ~1,850,000 gas alone. Luckily all these swaps happened during a relatively low gas price period last night (which is what got me to take the plunge), and I was especially lucky to get that largest gas step at 82 Gwei, but it still cost over $650 for that step alone. Overall I probably spent around $1500 to consolidate funds and launch the node.\n\nThat said I think the upside is definitely there to be worth it. Nodes registered before a certain date (I think its Nov 25th) are eligible for the first RPL rewards claim period as long as they are actively staked by ~Dec 7th, and the rewards are looking pretty spicy. Currently a node with the minimum RPL stake will earn about 0.18 ETH in rewards, and one with the max stake around 2.56. I'm about in the middle with 65%, so eligible for around ~1.35 ETH in just a few weeks. This will almost certainly be diluted by the time I get it, but should be enough to at least make up for the setup gas and everything after that is gravy.\n\nLast thought is that while the node operator rewards are very enticing for first wave adopters, I think they will likely continue to drop rather quickly as more nodes launch, and the queue is already pretty long (resulting in commission at only 5% for node operators). So I really struggled with whether I would be better off saving gas and some of the execution risk by just buying rETH. Once a few DeFi protocols incorporate rETH as a lego it the potential will be massive. \n\nIn a bull run I have little doubt that, for example, opening a CDP in DeFi saver using rETH as collateral and autoboosting will blow away returns you can get almost anywhere else. Borrowing stables against rETH and using it to buy rETH and boosting the CDP effectively allowing you to long ETH while getting leveraged staking rewards. With the merge around the corner having moderate leverage on an asset that will (imo) easily double in price AND gets leveraged staking returns (well over 5% depending on how much leverage you take to boost, probably could be closer to 7% or 8%). Now get DeFi Saver and something like Maker, Liquity, or Reflexer on a layer 2 like Optimism or Aribtrum for cheaper boosts, and we are really talking. Even MIM may work though I'm less familiar with it.\n\nI ultimately went with being a Node Operator in part because I believe in big appreciation in RPL, and in large part because I am just a big fan and wanted to support the network so have long wanted run one. But I think for anyone who doesn't get in over the next few days to make the first RPL reward claim period the risk benefit profile may tilt towards just buying rETH and waiting for DeFi composability with CDPs and L2s, then sit back and watch the fireworks over the next few months.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Finally got my long awaited rocketpool node up and running last night!

It's also not a direct response to the recent market movement, but partly connected to the twitter drama. \n\nThis time it is not different. Or in other words: this is still one of the 4ish-year cycles and there will be a bear market. But let me also say that this cycle hasn't ended yet, this is not the top and I feel like there is still room to grow, partly because the 10k meme (and basically all the memes, S2F etc.) hasn't self fulfilled and also because my bags need some more action to the upside. We are not done yet and there will be (at least) one more bubble/ blow off top. \n\nWhy is it not different? Let's be honest: neither ETH nor the market is where it has to be to doge bear bullets all the time. ETH has done a very good job, there have been great updates (both PoS starting last year and London this summer), but L2s/ execution layers aren't where ETH needs them to be to scale for the masses. The fees are just the result of this. I think last year I heard for the first time that \"within 12 months new users won't touch L1, they'll be onboarded to execution layers directly\". This is sadly not the reality and I am not going to blame anyone for it, doesn't matter, won't help. On top we are missing liquidity on all execution layers, and dapps have deployed, but are spread and users would have to bridge very often. This would probably still be better than fees on Ethereum, but if feels bad to pay for these bridge tx that you don't know from mainnet. So UX isn't really good at the moment. \n\nNow I guess even if execution layers worked as expected back then, this wouldn't help to the extent that we need it. If we assumed that optimistic rollups make up 50% of the (ETH) market, then 50% would only scale by more or less 10x. Now we could say \"but hey, that's 10$ instead of 100$ per swap, that's a huge improvement\" and of course it is! But if that was the case and we assumed that ETH/ crypto will grow (at least partly because the bull run continues and there is euphoria) then (at least a huge part of) these new users would onboard to ethereum (and not the shilled L1s). Which would lead to fees going up again. \n\nSo, tl;dr: I guess even with bridges to all the different execution layers (both from ETH, but more importantly CEXes) and 99% of the popular dApps and liquidity necessary to use them in a meaningful way we couldn't onboard all the people. Because fees would rise again, making Ethereum unusable for smaller stacks. \n\nSo what's really missing? Sharding / data shards obviously. We haven't even scheduled the merge, there is no date for sharding, but I guess we can assume by now that it won't be ready in 2022. I think a market could tolerate higher fees if the \"cure\" is on its way and people know they only need to wait a little longer, but I don't think we can really deliver here. \n\nI don't think we can have all the nice things if we can't \\_really\\_ scale and right now we can't to onboard a billion people. I think after seeing the fees spike on AVAX that even all EVM chains together couldn't onboard people and I won't be talking about SOL after the crash some weeks where just one launch stopped the chain for about a day. So it's not just ETH, the whole crypto ecosystem hasn't developed enough to onboard 1B people. \n\nWhy am I writing all of this down? As always to structure my thoughts. But also to convince myself to take profits. I won't take at lot of money out of the market, most likely it will only be my initial investment, which is really a rather minor amount. The rest will go to stables. But in the end this is not so much about the financial part of crypto, but about the emotional part of crypto.

However, a taxpayer may constructively receive cryptocurrency prior to the airdrop being recorded on the distributed ledger. A taxpayer does not have receipt of cryptocurrency when the airdrop is recorded on the distributed ledger if the taxpayer is not able to exercise dominion and control over the cryptocurrency. For example, a taxpayer does not have dominion and control if the address to which the cryptocurrency is airdropped is contained in a wallet managed through a cryptocurrency exchange and the cryptocurrency exchange does not support the newly-created cryptocurrency such that the airdropped cryptocurrency is not immediately credited to the taxpayer\u2019s account at the cryptocurrency exchange. **If the taxpayer later acquires the ability to transfer, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of the cryptocurrency, the taxpayer is treated as receiving the cryptocurrency at that time.**\n\nSo in your scenario the problem becomes dominion isn't a choice, it's a set of facts and circumstance. IF there was a BTC to BCH type fork that you just happened to get lucky and time it with Coinbase not giving you control, so be it. But you can't just say \"its in my wallet but im not touchig it\".\n\nGrey areas... IMX, ENS, UNI, other ones you need to take action to claim. Which I think is what your going after here. Basically I got an ENS airdrop, 'I'll wait until I move to claim it'. Probably could, I still think you run the risk of an IRS auditor saying that you had the right to claim it so its taxable... but I'm not so sure. Depends on your risk affinity I suppose. \n\nThe real problem you run into is now your letting your ENS airdrop sit will you go through that whole process. Would suck to have $1 millon dollars in ENS on the day of the drop only to have it drop to $100,000 by the time you actually claim.
