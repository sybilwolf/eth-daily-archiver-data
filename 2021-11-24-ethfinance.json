Ill try to explain it myself and would be looking forward to corrections/ add-ons. \n\nI guess (!) there are several bridges possible?\n\n1. BTC -> ETH: Afaik right now there is no trustless bridge, but if BTC supported smart contracts BTC could be locked on the bitcoin chain, and new bBTC (bridgedBTC) could be issued by a smart contract on ETH. Same reverse: you send bBTC back, bBTC is burned, BTC is released on bitcoin. \n2. Now this obviously doesn't work with assets like USDC because the bridge can't just create new USDC and issuing new bUSDC (bridgedUSDC) wouldn't make a lot of sense cause you couldn't use it anywhere because most protocols will only accept \"real\" USDC. So these bridges need liquidity on both ends of the bridge. You can provide liquidity on e.g. ETH or an execution layer, this liquidity is then used and handed over to the user interacting with the bridge. The LP as usual gets a fee for his service. \n\nIs this correct?\n\nThen I have one last question: whenever a new execution layer launches it's \"empty\", there are no assets there. So how does liquidity start existing in the first place? In the case of USDC I can imagine that the company issuing USDC just creates it, with the same trust assumptions as on ETH mainnet. But how about ETH? Is this defined by the official bridge? And does e.g. hop exchange then work with ETH provided by LPers that bridged via the official bridge?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have a question connected to bridges and how they technically work. Ill try to explain it myself and would be looking forward to corrections/ add-ons. </p>\n\n<p>I guess (!) there are several bridges possible?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>BTC -&gt; ETH: Afaik right now there is no trustless bridge, but if BTC supported smart contracts BTC could be locked on the bitcoin chain, and new bBTC (bridgedBTC) could be issued by a smart contract on ETH. Same reverse: you send bBTC back, bBTC is burned, BTC is released on bitcoin. </li>\n<li>Now this obviously doesn&#39;t work with assets like USDC because the bridge can&#39;t just create new USDC and issuing new bUSDC (bridgedUSDC) wouldn&#39;t make a lot of sense cause you couldn&#39;t use it anywhere because most protocols will only accept &quot;real&quot; USDC. So these bridges need liquidity on both ends of the bridge. You can provide liquidity on e.g. ETH or an execution layer, this liquidity is then used and handed over to the user interacting with the bridge. The LP as usual gets a fee for his service. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Is this correct?</p>\n\n<p>Then I have one last question: whenever a new execution layer launches it&#39;s &quot;empty&quot;, there are no assets there. So how does liquidity start existing in the first place? In the case of USDC I can imagine that the company issuing USDC just creates it, with the same trust assumptions as on ETH mainnet. But how about ETH? Is this defined by the official bridge? And does e.g. hop exchange then work with ETH provided by LPers that bridged via the official bridge?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-24 00:45:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlvozvm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r0xzvr","parent_id":"t3_r0xzvr","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/suclearnub","body":"renVM is as close to trustless as you can get, for BTC -> ERC-20 BTC.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>renVM is as close to trustless as you can get, for BTC -&gt; ERC-20 BTC.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-24 01:04:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlvqehy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r0xzvr","parent_id":"t1_hlvozvm","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-24 01:25:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlvrwcw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r0xzvr","parent_id":"t1_hlvqehy","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/suclearnub","body":"The chain that got giga-rekt a few months ago?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The chain that got giga-rekt a few months ago?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-24 02:35:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlvwuk4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r0xzvr","parent_id":"t1_hlvrwcw","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/LauriNiemiy","body":"Yeah, they are and even is one of the leading bridges for BTC to the Ethereum network and a favourite for Railgun as it got some form of privacy within its bridging architecture.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah, they are and even is one of the leading bridges for BTC to the Ethereum network and a favourite for Railgun as it got some form of privacy within its bridging architecture.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-24 03:06:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlvz6kx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r0xzvr","parent_id":"t1_hlvqehy","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"I thought tBTC was trustless?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I thought tBTC was trustless?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-24 01:14:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlvr4rp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r0xzvr","parent_id":"t1_hlvozvm","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"That's why I said \"as far as I know\", I just used BTC - ETH cause of the missing smart contracts, but maybe there is a way.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s why I said &quot;as far as I know&quot;, I just used BTC - ETH cause of the missing smart contracts, but maybe there is a way.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-24 01:32:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlvschk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r0xzvr","parent_id":"t1_hlvr4rp","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"I apologize.
