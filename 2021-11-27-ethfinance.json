Back in the earlier (2014-16 era) Ethereum community, there were a lot of people trying to build all kinds of decentralized real-world-economy apps, many with a very non-financialization-oriented ethic to them. Today there still are, but it's something that we should be fostering much more actively.\n\n[warning, long rant incoming]\n\nMy theory for why we don't centers around an idea that was described in [this very good tweet storm by Vinay](https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1396551074765541376). **A big reason why communities become culturally unsustainable is misalignment between capabilities and values**. When a community's self-professed values and what concrete power the community controls fall out of line, either the community gets its act together and realigns the latter toward the former, or eventually the former realigns toward the latter.\n\nThis even applies outside the crypto. To step briefly into a very political example (sorry but the ultimate goal of crypto is affecting the real world, so we have to talk about the real world sometimes!), many people in the United States genuinely value freedom, democracy and egalitarianism. However, attempts to execute on these values especially at government level crash into what the US government fundamentally _is_: it's a powerful empire wielding often blunt and ruinous economic sanction and military hammers, and with a persistent fear of losing its geopolitical primacy. And so the pressures of its capabilities end up leading to endless compromises on those values, to the point that to many outsiders it often looks like an unfriendly authoritarian empire. (How can the US fix this? I don't claim to have magic solutions; my best idea is that I think US human rights strategy should rebalance to a much heavier focus on [accepting mass immigration](https://archive.md/3jS8G) of both skilled and unskilled people)\n\nSo, back to Ethereum. Ethereum community values are diverse, and I think there's a mix between libertarian and egalitarian and general rationalish systems-thinking that's very healthy. But Ethereum's present _capabilities_, as Vinay points out, are certainly finance-biased in their current form. The three big misalignments between values and capabilities that I see are:\n\n* **Funding** (open source and public goods are valued, but the easiest money comes from launching a defi project)\n* **Proof of work** (not efficient, environmentally unfriendly, etc etc)\n* **Scaling and fees**\n\nExpanding on the third in particular:\n\nThe result of high fees today is often that the only thing that you *can* afford to do on Ethereum involves sloshing big amounts of money around. Sometimes sloshing big amounts of money around on Ethereum is really good even from an egalitarian point of view, like when an artist that would otherwise have a really hard time sells an NFT for $75,000. On average, however, it risks driving the community to insularity, building applications that mainly appeal to already-wealthy ETH holders.\n\nAnd my deep worry is that instead of helping to push the technology to make it in line with the community's values, the Ethereum community risks changing its values to align with the technology - that is, becoming an open proud \"by the rich for the rich\" ecosystem. Tweets [like this](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT/status/1437034213753167877), comparing Solana to fake Chanel bags and Ethereum to real Chanel. If I were not part of the Ethereum community, and I saw a tweet like that, I feel like it would make me instinctively pro-Solana almost immediately (I am pro fake designer goods markets, because of how they undermine zero-sum social-status-reinforcing nonsense).\n\n**The answer to complaints about fees should NEVER be \"Ethereum is where the important stuff happens, real men can afford it\", it should ALWAYS be \"go use one of these five layer 2 protocols, and by the way here's some teams working on bridges\".**\n\nOn all three above misalignments, the reality is that the Ethereum ecosystem is working really hard at bringing the capabilities in line with the values. For funding, we have Gitcoin Grants, we have Optimism Retro PGF, we have MolochDAO, and hopefully we will have much more. Proof of work is months away from being gone. And rollup teams truly are making amazing progress. We just have to remember that _that_ is the north star: not resigning ourselves to Ethereum's current state and deluding ourselves into thinking that we have some kind of infinitely durable moat and people will keep throwing in $70 million per day in fees out of respect for our super-awesome el33tness and status as \"the place where the real stuff happens\".\n\n(I _do_ really want Ethereum to succeed, both because the ideals of openness and decentralization and really valuable and the crypto space is in a strong position to become a primary standard-bearer of those values, and because even within the crypto space, the Ethereum community is among the strongest in having actually interesting philosophical thinking and not being content with just becoming a toy for wealthy financial people)\n\nAs for other political opinions in general, I've written many other pieces that touch on political topics!\n\n* [https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html)\n* [https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html)\n* [https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html)\n* [https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html)\n* [https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/05/09/control_as_liability.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/05/09/control_as_liability.html)\n* [https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/04/16/free_speech.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/04/16/free_speech.html)\n* [https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/11/25/central_planning.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/11/25/central_planning.html) (this one is underrated imo; it talks about how I think the distinction between _administrative_ \"big government\" and _fiscal_ \"big government\" is really important, and the costs largely come from the first and the benefits largely from the second)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>the potential that the blockchain has to empower workers and artists but cutting out exploitative corporations acting as middlemen</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I definitely wish that we could see more applications like this!
