E.g. a loop running, an 'if' clause being taken or not, etc.\n\n* Because they are reading and writing state. There's basically a huge database that Ethereum smart contracts can read and write to, but this is very expensive.\n\n* Because they have calldata associated with them. This is extraneous data that is not state, but can be relevant for many things. (This is the thing Vitalik is proposing reducing the gas cost by 5x for).\n\nzkRollups take the execution of average transactions, and perform it off-chain, with accompanying zk proofs. This compresses it such that e.g. 1000 transactions only need the execution bandwidth of 1. However, state transitions can't be compressed, and a bunch of calldata is produced.

One is a single line of code change and will at least 2x reduce the data rollups need to use. The other is a little more complex but sill fairly simple in the grand scheme of things and will at least 5x the reduction in calldata used by rollups.
