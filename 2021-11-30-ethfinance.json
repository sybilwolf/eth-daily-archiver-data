Those are five people from the core DeFi Saver/Decenter team, practically all DFS co-founders.\n\nNow, considering other safety questions.\n\nWhen interacting with any defi protocol using DeFi Saver, you should consider that there's a layer of DFS smart contracts your assets are going through to reach the selected protocol. I'm *not* referring to the dsproxy, which is a fully permissionless proxy in use by a number of major protocols by defaut (e.g. Maker, Reflexer) - that's not something that's created by us. The contracts in question are our \"[recipes architecture](https://github.com/DecenterApps/defisaver-v3-contracts)\" and sounds like you already checked out the audits on those.\n\nThis would also be the case when using any other defi management apps, such as Oasis, Furucombo, Instadapp, Zapper or Zerion, to name a few. One thing with Oasis specifically is that people often consider it the default Maker app or something along those lines, while in reality it's built by a team completely separate from Maker engineers and developers, and has some of its own smart contracts, too.\n\nIn addition to risk while using the DFS frontend, if you plan to use DFS Automation, you should consider that a separate layer of risk. Our approach with automation development has always been to stick to security as priority over everything, which is one of the main reasons why new automation features development and rollout has been so slow (though I can also say that it should finally be happening soon\u2122).\n\nIn terms of Automation history, the system has managed up to $1.6B in collateralized assets and has had no security issues discovered so far (since initial launch in September 2019).\n\nShould that be taken as guarante of safety? No, I don't think so.\n\nUltimately, the decision whether you should deploy all your assets into defi through DFS will be on you of course. I've personally done so for the great part of my participation in DeFi and I'm super glad to see people replying with a firm yes, but the argument of *all eggs one basket bad* definitely stands.\n\nLet me know if there's anything specific I can expand on more, this reply has already gotten pretty long as is.\ud83d\ude2c","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><em>tl;dr You&#39;re not putting funds into DeFi Saver per se, as its not a protocol on its own, but deploying funds into defi protocols through DeFi Saver should be considered as containing an additional layer of smart contracts and therefore risk compared to interacting directly with any protocol&#39;s contracts.</em></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a good question and I&#39;ll try to provide as much context for making an informed choice as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, you asked about multisig signers.
