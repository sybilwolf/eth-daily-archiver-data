If you deposit wrapped ether (WETH) you can earn 0.40% in WETH and 1.86% in WMATIC, you can then borrow 80% of the collateral value, for which you pay 2.37% interest, but get rewarded 1.09% in WMATIC... which works out to a net benefit of 0.98%. That&#39;s not great, but if you deposit what you&#39;ve borrowed back into the platform you can get more of the deposit rewards... and then borrow more, and deposit that.. and, well you get the idea! In reality it doesn&#39;t work out to an amazing free money machine because you&#39;re borrowing less and less all the time, but it is free of liquidation risk because both sides of your borrowing and lending are the same token and so won&#39;t change in value relative to each other (you can only get liquidated if your amount borrowed increases relative to your deposit, so only a risk if they are different assets).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-01 04:26:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hmse36k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r67vkm","parent_id":"t1_hms8x9a","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/consideritwon","body":"ETH staking is paying rewards but they are just locked up for probably a year and a half. \n\nBear in mind that any yield you generate in smart contracts is at the risk of smart contract hacks and the loss of all of your funds.

To reach 10x at 10% collateral would require 36M ETH staked through rocketpool which is never, ever going to happen (returns would be way too low, there&#39;s not going to be enough interest to stake that much, far better options for higher returns at that point).  At 150% collateral it would be 2.4M ETH, which could happen, but the average collateralization is not going to be 150%, most people are predicting around 20%.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry, but without rampant speculation, RPL/ETH is not going to 10x.
