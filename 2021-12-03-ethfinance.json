It was an enlightening meeting for me personally, and I hope this funhouse mirror retelling of the MEV conundrum is helpful for others, if you\u2019re interested - please chime in if I butcher any details!\n\nOkay, so firstly, a definition of MEV (formerly short for miner extractable value, now maximal extractable value in the age of POS). This is a different sort of value that can be captured by consensus keepers (be they miners or validators/block proposers). In short, it is captured by building proposed blocks of transactions by arbitrarily rearranging transactions and/or drawing from private mempools (private lists of proposed transactions) to yield some sort of profit. Normally blocks are built using transactions in the public mempool - everyone can see them, and the primary selection criterion for a block proposed is whether a) the block has enough gas to meet the base fee requirements for the current gas environment, and b) if there are tips attached that would incentivize prioritization of that transaction for inclusion in the block. That\u2019s all well and great, and will be a natural part of the block proposer experience. \n\nThere are also private mempools, though - these are like side channels, in which privately proposed transactions can be batched together and appended to the publicly available transaction data. This can be done for totally benign purposes (e.g. to prevent others from front-running some transaction I want to push through, say a tasty arbitrage opportunity between DeFi exchanges, or a rare liquidation event that I want to identify and snap up rewards for). It can also be done for more malign purposes (e.g. proposing a reorganization of transactions such that a single transaction could be censored for multiple blocks, or using flash loans to exploit a DeFi app). Even quasi-malign interactions - e.g. front-running to snipe a public transaction or sandwiching a public order to temporarily spike the price and claim someone\u2019s bid at an outsized mark-up - are technically just part of the free-market dynamic, and aren\u2019t inherently \u201cbad.\u201d Just big fish eat little fish stuff (and the use of private mempools also allows for protection against that stuff).\n\nAnyway, in MEV today, there are a few actors at play - searchers (who batch together transactions that would yield MEV, and then build bundles to propose to\u2026), builders (who specialize in putting these bundles of transactions into blocks and sending them to\u2026), miners (who propose these blocks, often with private tips/bribes included to incentivize the MEV/private mempool approach). Technically the searcher/builder could be the same individual (and in POS the proposer will be randomly selected), but it\u2019s generally expected that there will be a large degree of specialization. In particular, block building is a very compute-intensive process (because it has to happen within the space of a 13-second block time), and so that is thought to be the primary centralization risk.\n\nThe recognition of MEV as a force for centralization was what led to the development of MEV-Geth by the Flashbots group, in January of this year. This is a public goods execution client that makes MEV capture more accessible to all miners, by including native block building and private mempool searching functions (for basic MEV opportunities). It achieved broad penetration very quickly, particularly within mining pools, and is used by 90% of the network today.\n\nThe concern with a shift to POS, is the network will drop back down to 0% penetration of a public goods MEV client. This is fine if there is a replacement (and there will be - MEV-boost is being worked on now, and it will be possible to integrate it into all consensus clients). There\u2019s always a risk, though, that proprietary algorithms come along offering better MEV capture rates. If you\u2019ve been making an extra 0.1 ETH per proposed block using MEV Boost, and Kraken comes forward and says we now have an MEV builder client (perhaps in partnership with some searcher program that gives privileged access to a selective, private mempool) that yields 1 ETH per proposed block, people are going to rush to join the Kraken staking pools. That would be very bad for centralization, but even if Kraken just offers that block builder service to solo stakers (say, for a fee of 0.1 ETH per proposed block), now a single entity is building 90% of blocks on the chain. If that entity were to be malicious (e.g. should they decide not to include transactions from, say, Gemini), those malicious blocks would be propagated unknowingly by validators. Worse, the malicious entity could propose invalid blocks, resulting in chain reorgs, forks, and slashing events.\n\nOne way of getting around this is to continually pursue optimized public goods MEV clients, such that everyone is on an even footing. Even so, in a high stakes arms race, there\u2019s likely going to be a front-runner. To protect validators from malicious builders, the proposer-builder separation (PBS) scheme will aim to have a native relayer role within the Ethereum protocol, such that a block advanced by the builder can be checked for general validity before it is relayed to the validator for proposal. This would be done privately (e.g. the proposer would also only see the block header, to protect the optimized work product of the builder).\n\nThis is likely the medium-term solution - there will still be centralization pressures coming from the block builders, but the system will be protected from overtly malicious action. In the long-term, one current proposal is exploring the use of MEV smoothing (a quasi socialized approach wherein captured MEV is shared across a committee of validators). You could also envision an unbiased in-protocol sequencer (as will exist for several of the emerging roll-ups). These solutions have their drawbacks and trade offs (e.g. protocol centralization, and the difficulty of even defining what is the MEV which needs to be smoothed), and these approaches are actively being explored.\n\nUltimately, MEV is a necessary consequence of a free and open market, and so the teams are focused on how to optimally foster competition within that market, maintaining decentralization and delivering optimal value to the users and custodians of the chain.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more, the Flashbots team released their first paper today, discussing MEV in the multi-chain future - you can find a link to that paper here: https://twitter.com/obadiaalex/status/1466853129664798722?s=21","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>All right, very sorry to clog up the memepool here, but based on engagement I did opt to write up a little summary on the MEV meeting today (continuing my screed from a few comments below this one).

These solutions have their drawbacks and trade offs (e.g. protocol centralization, and the difficulty of even defining what is the MEV which needs to be smoothed), and these approaches are actively being explored.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, MEV is a necessary consequence of a free and open market, and so the teams are focused on how to optimally foster competition within that market, maintaining decentralization and delivering optimal value to the users and custodians of the chain.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in learning more, the Flashbots team released their first paper today, discussing MEV in the multi-chain future - you can find a link to that paper here: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/obadiaalex/status/1466853129664798722?s=21\">https://twitter.com/obadiaalex/status/1466853129664798722?s=21</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-03 16:03:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hn4t48u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r7s2wl","parent_id":"t3_r7s2wl","score":54,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SwagtimusPrime","body":"Great summary, thank you.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Great summary, thank you.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-03 16:26:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hn4w453","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r7s2wl","parent_id":"t1_hn4t48u","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/mattnumber","body":"So many wordz","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So many wordz</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-03 16:07:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hn4toyt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r7s2wl","parent_id":"t1_hn4t48u","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pocketwailord","body":"TL;DR people like money, and will try to make as much money as possible using various tools and programs.

I'm obviously not going to say sell/buy or give that kind of advice in this moment, but broadly speaking / for planning ahead, I will say don't underestimate the emotional toll of having a lot of paper wealth but nothing to really show for it (Of course, excluding the IVF! That is no way a mistake / regret!). I suffer from that time to time, this feeling that you made a ton but haven't enjoyed it. Or if I sold for retirement purposes it's such a delayed satisfaction...\n\nIt's tough because there is no right or wrong way to feel, but I personally think the all or nothing mindset is dangerous and can lead to not feeling satisfied no matter where you end up. Maybe really think about what you want to accomplish and how realistic it is? Maybe find a way to give certain numbers meaning? Aka retiring at 52 instead of 62 doesn't sound *that* huge on paper, but then you think about the last 10 years of your employment and having avoided it! Of course retiring at 42 is better, but where is the line in the sand for that risk? Or maybe if you pay off your debt how much more $X a month would mean to you if it could go straight to fun time with the family then loan payments.

I&#39;m obviously not going to say sell/buy or give that kind of advice in this moment, but broadly speaking / for planning ahead, I will say don&#39;t underestimate the emotional toll of having a lot of paper wealth but nothing to really show for it (Of course, excluding the IVF! That is no way a mistake / regret!). I suffer from that time to time, this feeling that you made a ton but haven&#39;t enjoyed it. Or if I sold for retirement purposes it&#39;s such a delayed satisfaction...</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s tough because there is no right or wrong way to feel, but I personally think the all or nothing mindset is dangerous and can lead to not feeling satisfied no matter where you end up. Maybe really think about what you want to accomplish and how realistic it is? Maybe find a way to give certain numbers meaning? Aka retiring at 52 instead of 62 doesn&#39;t sound <em>that</em> huge on paper, but then you think about the last 10 years of your employment and having avoided it! Of course retiring at 42 is better, but where is the line in the sand for that risk? Or maybe if you pay off your debt how much more $X a month would mean to you if it could go straight to fun time with the family then loan payments.

If you don&#39;t want to learn how to do that (its easier than you think its pretty easy to set up and then it is automated) I would just hold eth instead of trying to trade it personally.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-03 20:08:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hn5n61h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r7s2wl","parent_id":"t1_hn5kfdx","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/suburbiton","body":"I started doing this a little, but using a liquidity optimizer.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I started doing this a little, but using a liquidity optimizer.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-03 14:19:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hn4fflx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r7s2wl","parent_id":"t1_hn3trca","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/plupps","body":"Genius","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Genius</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-03 11:18:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hn3qf9n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r7s2wl","parent_id":"t1_hn3phsb","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/ab111292","body":"Yes you're right.
