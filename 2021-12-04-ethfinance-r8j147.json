I honestly can't really think of a time where the entire market tanked this bad and the ratio not only held but grew. If it happened before it has to be super rare, right? Anyone remember? Surely not since mid-2017 at least.\n\nI can't stress enough this is the economic power of EIP-1559 coupled with the gigantic smart contract ecosystem being built on top of ETH. I still remember that moment in early 2016 in the Poloniex trollbox finding ETH being spammed in the chat. Then going to read the main thesis behind it and it all just clicking. Very vividly honestly, and I truly have a bad memory. The basic principle of owning the oil that makes the decentralized computer run and the demand that would grow from that. \n\nBut man, even back then the thought of something like EIP-1559 coming along to turbocharge how much demand creates scarcity of ETH did not cross my mind. If you are sitting there thinking 1559 didn't create the supply shock you hoped it would your just flat out wrong. Whatever metric you are looking at or logical path you are following, find another. EIP-1559 is basically R. Lee Ermey right now. 1559 has every single gwei's name and has their ass. No gwei will laugh, no gwei will cry. Every single gwei or token that even moves will cause some sort of burning.\n\nWhich means when events like last night happen that extra oomph that is usually there from miners is missing. They can't dump because they don't have it. Its going slow now, but the pressure is there. A constant wave crashing against the walls. Every dump will be slightly less. Sideways action will have a natural slow swelling upward. Price explosions can go that extra .1% because miners are not able to sell into a pump. All of this before the 90% incoming supply reduction we will see post merge. \n\nWe shall see, weekend isn't over yet. Optimistic so far as we are hovering around .08 with a  lot more conviction then last time we hit it and saw a big market drop.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This a post born out of dusting off the cobwebs of my very shitty memory.

Bitcoin is below the historical bull market support levels at around $52K. However it has done this before this bull run. What I am watching is if this is just a multi hour or multi-day wick down below these levels before quickly recovering before the daily and weekly candle closes. Alternatively, Bitcoin could do what it did earlier this year where it sat below the support levels for a while. One thing which suggests this might not be the end of the bull run is the BTC/ETH ratio. Historically this always goes down in a bear market since money flows out of altcoins. So this would either indicate that people are starting to favour ETH as a store of value over BTC or the bull run isn\u2019t over and this has been a coordinated crash by large players to liquidate leverage long positions and buy back cheaper after the resulting crash. Plus when I look at all of the indicators I laid out in [my exit strategy](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/hiksh6/how_i_plan_to_identify_and_sell_the_top_of_the/) none of them are anywhere near flashing sell or indicating the end of the bull run yet. In fact, I find it hard to look at these charts and see them as bearish. So it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the bull run simply takes a little bit longer (Q2-3 2022?) than the previous one which makes sense given that each successive crypto cycle has lengthened. \n\nOn the bearish side, this move has happened on low volume. Often if a big move up or down happens on low volume it means that not many people are willing to buy the dip or sell the top in the opposite direction to the move. This does concern me a little bit as our peak at $69K had almost twice as much volume yet this saw the price move much more. Plus financial markets in general aren\u2019t looking too healthy right now which isn\u2019t good as if they start to tumble further we will likely follow.\n\nWhatever happens I am sticking to the sell indicators. We all know how uber bullish ETH is looking especially the tokenomics post-merge. Who knows, maybe a lengthened cycle is bullish as it gives us more time to onboard users to L2s. ZKRollups are going to be fucking revolutionary. I won't be taking profits (outside of a small chunk for taxes) until a minimum of $9K with the biggest chunk going once some of my indicators start flashing (and I of course have a forever HODL stack). Even if we enter a bear market from here I will continue to hold. Ethereum is so well entrenched now as a technology that you just can\u2019t lose if you're in it for the long run. ^(Not financial advice)\n\nBut wait, then we have the wildcard option... This could be a paradigm shift for the wider crypto markets. Ethereum is found everywhere where crypto is breaking into the mainstream. Play to earn gaming, NFTs, DeFi, the metaverse, a currency at fucking Christies art auctions... the list goes on and these are all killer apps. On top of that Ethereum is about to kill the PoW environmental FUD with an upgrade which will simultaneously increase network security drastically and almost certainly turn ETH into a deflationary, ultra sound money. The memes are juicy and we have loaded the FOMO cannons. We are merely awaiting launch likely around Q2 next year. On top of that, one day in Ethereum news is as busy as a month in Bitcoin news and people are beginning to realise this.

First off, THANK YOU everyone who responded to this question last night. I recieved alot of different opinions, alot of different things to consider and think about.

I have... conundrum. Be me. Be 30. Have nice girlfriend you wanna marry next year amd settle down with. Have ETH you've been holding since 2017.\n\nTheres this house. Five bed, three bath, 3000 sq, on half an acre. Safe, friendly neighborhood. The kind where kids can safely ride bikes, and be kids. Close to my fam and work. Recent build, 2017. I know of the architect, he makes solid houses. I have never bought a house before. \n\nThe bulk of my investments and net worth is in ETH. At current prices, if I sell everything in my cryptowallet, and even with what the bank gives me... I'd still be 100k short. EDIT: As of this morning, it's now like... 140k away. Ouch. The other investments arent really worth mentioning.\n\nOn one hand, this house has been on the market for over two months, which is RARE AS HELL in my area, where they sell in like, five days sight unseen. The price has dropped bt 10k each at the start of each month. I'm doing what I can to see why this isnt selling as fast... and if I should get it. \n\nMy gf loves the house. *I love the house.* or rather I love the idea of it. Its... one of those places you cpuld get married, raise a family, and die on, you know?\n\nIf ETH hits 6k, after taxes, I could buy it with what the bank is willing to lend me. IF I could get it, the mortage would be like 600 bucks a month, the taxes would be 700 a month. The house would be in my name.\n\nId...  also be out of the crypto game in any meaningful way. I have nodes. I know theres not many of us that one, let alone multiples. I might never reclaim even one of I sell. If ETH hits 7k or 8k when I sell, I'd at least have some money to rebuy at a lower point.\n\nI'm scared the house is going to sell before I can get enough for it. I'm afraid if I sell my ETH, I sell the best asset I have and chance for a solid future. I'm afraid of putting off some aspects of my life, given how insane the housing market and the scariness surrounding the economy, today.\n\nI'm literally frozen in indecision.

Even with room for fun and jokes, they just did not come across as serious in the blockchain and decentralisation values that I prioritise.

It was revisited once or twice but I was left with the nagging contradiction that Solana is simultaneously a high performance blockchain that is reliable for cheap and fast transactions, yet down time is expected and okay because they move fast in development and shutdowns suck but aren\u2019t a problem because assets aren\u2019t at risk as long as there\u2019s one node to restart from.
