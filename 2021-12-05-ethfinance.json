They migrate to an L2 and still find that a swap, LP and farm costs about $20-30 in total...and they have to wait for several months before harvesting any rewards to make it worth the $5  fees. Meanwhile if you&#39;re a whale with 7 figures you have access to 70% returns on your stablecoins on some farms, and fees are irrelevant...while the guy from Turkey or India who needs this the most has to just watch from the sidelines as the whales make a killing. Zhu is an opportunistic parasite, but to these users, it <em>would</em> seem that ethereum has abandoned them and avax/bsc/polygon/solana are the only places that care about them..and many would not care about decentralisation or the Eth ecosystem from there onwards. </p>\n\n<p>So I do think reducing fees on L2s (which is the primary scaling strategy for Eth in the medium/long term) asap is absolutely critical at this point on the roadmap, even more so than the merge (although as an Eth asset holder I would prefer the merge asap too). If the ecosystem is repeatedly excluding certain parts of retail, we are recreating walled gardens for the rich just like the twisted tradfi world again...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-05 14:14:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hndqgtj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_r991sy","parent_id":"t1_hndakax","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"> not a trustless L2\n\nThe rollups deployed in their current form are not trustless.

After all, an AMM with low TVL will be inefficient for large volume traders trying to swap between coins without high slippage. Sushiswap - which aimed to be a community governed Automatic Market Maker - first incentivized users to stake LP positions from Uniswap on the platform to earn Sushi Tokens. This was done via Liquidity Mining. First used by IDEX (2017) in a very primitive form, then refined in DeFi summer with Synthetix and Compound (2020). After Sushiswap gained enough liquidity, history was made. This was the first time in DeFi History (and in finance history) where a vampire attack was carried to such a large degree. In the space of a week **$1 Billion** was siphoned from Uniswap and into SushiSwap.
