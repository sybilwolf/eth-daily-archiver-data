Or another ETF will pop up allowing you to switch or put pressure on their fee amount. \n\nI've mentioned it before and I wouldn't change my answer still - the moment an ETH ETF exists I'm moving my ETHE over to that. I don't think ETHE is bad, it's just not as good as an ETF would be at this point. ETHE served it's purpose and some of us got some nice boosts due to the premium, but that period seems over. \n\nNow to sort of move past my cop-out and get to a real answer. I don't really see much downside beyond the fees and maybe some lingering EFT risk? But I also think the fee issue gets completely negated by the tax savings in an asset that grows like this. Especially when we talk 1 to 5 years versus 30. I've done the math before and it really is not that big of a gain were a 2.5% cut is completely negated by even a 15% tax savings. \n\nEFT risk, for a lack of a better word - I think some people are scared that if an ETF pops up ETHE's discount to NAV will fall even more. It was for sure a bigger fear when the premium was so high. Now it's not as scary as the premium has been vaporized. But that threat is still there I suppose? In theory an EFT can pop up and people just sell their ETHE for what they can get and it causes a bigger discount. Of course, one could argue past an initial surge it may help the discount lessen as people bet ETHE / GBTC get converted to an ETF eventually. Or simply the announcement of an EFT boosts the price so much it negates any small increase in discount. \n\nYou've sort of hit on it with your last sentence - the big risk here is ETH itself. Since the premium died out I've basically treated all my ETHE trades based on the underlying performance of ETH. And when we get into the question of \"Is there any downside to holding ETH for 30 years\" I think you know my answer... lol","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think probably the easily skippable answer to this question is do you really think ETHE will exist in this form in 30 years? I&#39;m not sure it will even exist in this form in 5 years... As in, I would be shocked if it isn&#39;t replace by an EFT style fund at that point. Or another ETF will pop up allowing you to switch or put pressure on their fee amount. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve mentioned it before and I wouldn&#39;t change my answer still - the moment an ETH ETF exists I&#39;m moving my ETHE over to that. I don&#39;t think ETHE is bad, it&#39;s just not as good as an ETF would be at this point. ETHE served it&#39;s purpose and some of us got some nice boosts due to the premium, but that period seems over. </p>\n\n<p>Now to sort of move past my cop-out and get to a real answer.
