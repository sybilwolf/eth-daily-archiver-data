Don't ever let someone tell you this is BTC's market. It's just ratio watch for us. So far, the massive fib level of 0.0845 has held. We tend to ride up on the 10 Day and 20 Day MAs, so with the 10D currently around 0.0823ish, we just need to keep holding and hoping the old man doesn't keel over out of pure spite and obsolescence.\n* BTC - As I said, trying not to die. Instead of testing the 10 Day up at $52.5k, he keeps insisting on testing the 200 Day at $50.1k because he's a weak piece of shit. Until he starts closing larger candles above $51.3k, this is a daily-level bear flag and we've gotta be careful.\n* BTC Shorts - What are the whales up to? Shorts are down and broke through several supports. But this isn't good or bad; there's no predictive value to shorts when they can close out of both success and out of failure. All that cascading shorts means is guaranteed volatility. So, prepare for a move up or down (bring the lolz) but either way it should be large.\n* VIX (21.9) - Doing exactly what we want, gapping down big through support at 26. Another move down through support at 19.5 would be a great argument that the bull has resumed for a Santa Rally. While this downward move is good, anything above 20 is still ripe for a rip in any direction.\n* SPY (468.28) - After a wild green power hour loaded with manipulation, the market closed green in a huge hammer above not only all major MAs but also the pre-omicron level at 468.18. It's the kinda move that mimics Oct 15 which bought us another 5-6 weeks of bull. *However*... I gotta say, that monster green power hour was almost too good. Personally I would've liked a minor red. This feels manipulative. Remember, whales are pansexual. They will fuck bears, bulls, antelope, anything. A candle like that tends to mean green day tomorrow but with the jobs report and then CPI data Friday, I'm way more cautious than if they ran a little time off the clock with a nice clean red candle. Idk. Data vs my feelings.\n\nedit: \\[bonus\\] VVIX - yes that's right if you're a complete fucking lunatic like me, there's even a volatility chart *for the volatility chart*. it's similarly down. it's more an oscillator than a thing that bounces so if we can get one more down day on the VIX, this might be a confluence of safety for a few weeks.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Markets Recap</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ETH - Continues to fight for 50 on the RSI (bullish reading) while grandpa struggles to not straight-up die at 30 on its RSI.

So, prepare for a move up or down (bring the lolz) but either way it should be large.</li>\n<li>VIX (21.9) - Doing exactly what we want, gapping down big through support at 26. Another move down through support at 19.5 would be a great argument that the bull has resumed for a Santa Rally. While this downward move is good, anything above 20 is still ripe for a rip in any direction.</li>\n<li>SPY (468.28) - After a wild green power hour loaded with manipulation, the market closed green in a huge hammer above not only all major MAs but also the pre-omicron level at 468.18. It&#39;s the kinda move that mimics Oct 15 which bought us another 5-6 weeks of bull. <em>However</em>... I gotta say, that monster green power hour was almost too good. Personally I would&#39;ve liked a minor red. This feels manipulative. Remember, whales are pansexual. They will fuck bears, bulls, antelope, anything. A candle like that tends to mean green day tomorrow but with the jobs report and then CPI data Friday, I&#39;m way more cautious than if they ran a little time off the clock with a nice clean red candle. Idk. Data vs my feelings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>edit: [bonus] VVIX - yes that&#39;s right if you&#39;re a complete fucking lunatic like me, there&#39;s even a volatility chart <em>for the volatility chart</em>. it&#39;s similarly down. it&#39;s more an oscillator than a thing that bounces so if we can get one more down day on the VIX, this might be a confluence of safety for a few weeks.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-07 16:30:58","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-12-07 16:54:23","id":"hnnrm5h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ras7o3","parent_id":"t3_ras7o3","score":53,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/kenzi28","body":">Remember, whales are pansexual.

I am very smart.&#39;</em></p>\n\n<p>-Dog coins</p>\n\n<p>-Billionaires tweeting about it</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Those things alone would be enough to turn me off and see all of this is a big joke and probably prompt no further investigation. But ok sure, let&#39;s assume I would be open minded enough to give crypto a chance and try to learn about it. So allow me search on youtube for a video where I can learn about crypto. The results come up with countless videos with too many emojis and people with O-Faces, with the titles like:</p>\n\n<p>-<em>1000x GAINS FROM X COIN???\\</em>*</p>\n\n<p><em>-THESE ALT COINS WILL MAKE YOU A MILLIONAIRE!!!!!\\</em>*</p>\n\n<p><em>-BTC TO THE MOON?!!!?!??!?!?\\</em>*</p>\n\n<p><em>-HOW TO GET RICH FROM SELLING NFTS!!!!!\\</em>*</p>\n\n<p><em>\\</em>This is not financial advice ;)*</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I mention this a lot in here, but this along with the other typical reasons we always hear, are why people are turned off to this market. So as you mentioned, there are tons of scams in this space, so it makes perfect sense that people view it that way.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll eventually get over this when more utility and adoption occurs and people understand blockchain as a platform and not an overhyped P2P currency that is difficult to use.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-07 05:08:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hnl7u43","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ras7o3","parent_id":"t1_hnksqat","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/vedran_","body":"O man, you nailed it with the grifting part!
