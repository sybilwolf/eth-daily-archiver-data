Just for kicks, I wanted to dig into what kind of capital that would actually take.\n\nBased on estimates from u/dpxlumpi about a month ago, POS Ethereum will require 25-50 GWh of energy per year, compared to the current 81 TWh/yr under POW. Some of my [envelope musings](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qhfeln/daily_general_discussion_october_28_2021/hifa1b4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) pinned 50 GWh/yr as roughly the same energy consumption as an American town with a population of 4,500 people.\n\nDigging into it a bit, 50 GWh is approximately the energy that would be generated by a 140-acre (0.22 square miles/0.57 square kilometer) [solar farm](https://greencoast.org/solar-farm-land-requirements/). It would amount to about 30% the land area of Disneyland, or 115 American football fields\u2019 worth of land. For international reference, that\u2019s about 3.5 Taj Mahals or Buckingham Palaces (interestingly about the same size). \n\nAs a slightly more accessible metric, this area is about the size of a [small family ranch](https://farmingbase.com/how-many-acres-is-considered-a-ranch/#How_Many_Acres_is_Considered_a_Ranch), like the one pictured [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=140+acre+map&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS900US900&hl=en-US&prmd=misxvn&sxsrf=AOaemvKH-j1VhjP3HXcpNa6z66tYRz6G4Q:1638990947214&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjj-cqJ9dT0AhWKd98KHf6IAFkQ_AUoAnoECAIQAg&biw=375&bih=553&dpr=2#imgrc=sqD7ilvvw9fQEM) next to a standard neighborhood subdivision.

If the total consumption comes in closer to the low end of the estimate (25 GWh/yr), a solar farm that would fully offset the energy requirements of proof-of-stake Ethereum could be constructed for less than what the trolls of the Internet pulled together in three days when trying to purchase the US Constitution.

It\u2019s <a href=\"https://solarchoiceusa.com/industry/agriculture/\">estimated</a> that an acre of solar panels costs around $500k to install, so the entire thing could be funded for $70m (plus $1-2m for the land itself, unless it\u2019s leased from an existing landowner). If the total consumption comes in closer to the low end of the estimate (25 GWh/yr), a solar farm that would fully offset the energy requirements of proof-of-stake Ethereum could be constructed for less than what the trolls of the Internet pulled together in three days when trying to purchase the US Constitution. This additional solar capacity would offset energy consumption by the entire network, allowing the future settlement layer of the global financial system to be run in a completely energy-neutral fashion. </p>\n\n<p>I think that\u2019s ridiculous, and kind of awesome - we should do it!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-08 11:18:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hnr5ubm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rbk9tl","parent_id":"t3_rbk9tl","score":58,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/dpxlumpi","body":"I love your enthusiasm!

I am trying to understand how the continued inflow of validators affects ETH issuance</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-08 12:22:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hnrfy1m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rbk9tl","parent_id":"t1_hnrcqod","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"Hmm so they took away the graph on the [https://launchpad.ethereum.org/](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/) site (where I've pointed people in the past)... But if you go to this article [https://www.stakingrewards.com/journal/ultimate-ethereum-2-0-staking-guide/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/journal/ultimate-ethereum-2-0-staking-guide/) and I also found this site [https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/ethereum-2-0/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/ethereum-2-0/) (once you select \"run a validator\" and you can change how many ETH are being staked to see how it affects \"adj. reward\") you can probably get an idea of what I'm talking about. Or should help you visualize rewards better.\n\nIt does go below 5% but you'll note if you find that one graph in the article and look at the charts (or play with that calculator) it takes more deposited ETH to move the APR down each .1% point. It's an exponential decay curve, reverse exponential growth? idk... whatever the term is, algebra was long ago! You'll see what I mean even though my terminology sucks...\n\nWith that all said, here's my response on your three questions.\n\n1. Basically see above. The reward curve had higher reductions in APR per ETH staking in the beginning but now as more people are staking the slower the APR lowers. So it's 'flattening out' in that sense\n2. Yes, at 10 million ETH staked the APR will be less then 8.9 Million. 11 Million less then 10, and so on. Now, is it worthwhile? That's basically an economics questions. Is the demand there? As of now yes, but I guess we will see. At some point the market will find an equilibrium, could be 5%, could be 4%, could be 2%. \n3. Basically, more ETH staking = more ETH issued overall. The APR is lower but the amount of ETH staked is higher and nets to an increase in issuance. But as you saw with my other post, issuance rates are still really low regardless of total network wide staked amount. We will see a reduction in issuance on switch from PoW to PoS no matter what.\n\nIt's worth pointing out this is sort of information at 10,000 feet. Super detailed \"8,982,247 ETH staked is really 5.1943 APR and 9,145,285 is is really 5.1843\"\"  is the type of analysis beyond my scope.
