Just tax carbon. Why would we ban something that uses way less carbon then the oil and gas industry or factory farming or any number of things. If people want to argue that those things are more important ok whatever then the question goes how much more important? quantify it then align incentives.

This is often a similar story to carbon credits; an emotive soul cleansing activity. </p>\n\n<p>Planting the tree is just the first step and you usually have no idea what protection that tree has, if any, where it is, whether it\u2019s simply replacing a felled tree, or of its future prospects; these trees are often planted by for profit companies in very poor places with zero protection and will be felled shortly after.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve seen schemes that advertised millions of trees planted, in which 90%+ of them had died within 2 years and many others would ultimately fail due to excessively dense and inappropriately located planting. They then replanted in a very similar fashion and counted all those new trees as more trees planted. Those that did survive were so densely planted that extensive thinning (removal of a high proportion) will be needed in a few years.</p>\n\n<p>I agree the most impactful things we can do are in our role as consumers; less/no meat/dairy, less/no flying, home insulation, renewables, less driving, less fast fashion etc. People blame corporations etc. But they\u2019re often only supplying our demand.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-08 23:25:45","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-12-08 23:52:44","id":"hnts6al","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rcb6qu","parent_id":"t1_hntqnsa","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethrevolution","body":"\\+1 on the empty \"we plant trees\" promise, indeed!    \nWhat we need is not more trees overall (this might be factually false) but a better geographical distribution, and longevity, of our trees.     \n\n\nIt's actually quite simple: if it's run as a business, it's time to break out ye olde tinfoil hat.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>+1 on the empty &quot;we plant trees&quot; promise, indeed!<br/>\nWhat we need is not more trees overall (this might be factually false) but a better geographical distribution, and longevity, of our trees.     </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s actually quite simple: if it&#39;s run as a business, it&#39;s time to break out ye olde tinfoil hat.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-08 23:30:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hntsid7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rcb6qu","parent_id":"t1_hnts6al","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/-lightfoot","body":"We do need more trees imo, we just need them to be planted in the right place and like you say protect them for better longevity.\n\nLand availability and prices are difficult, hence all the scammy tree planting schemes and loopholes, but stuff like less meat frees up vast, unimaginably vast areas of additional land much of which was covered by trees until relatively recently, and this would open up massive opportunities for longterm reforestation.
