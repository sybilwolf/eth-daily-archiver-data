You&#39;ll earn transaction fees from whenever someone uses the platform/tokens you&#39;re providing liquidity on to make a swap. This income will be paid out whenever you remove the assets from the liquidity pool.</p>\n\n<p>Step 2: Stake LP tokens to &quot;farm&quot; yield - Go to the farm tab and deposit your LP token into the corresponding farm. You&#39;ll accrue yield in a token native to the protocol your providing liquidity to,  and can claim it whenever without unlocking the LP token or removing liquidity. </p>\n\n<p>This can be done on different platforms, but Zapper is super simple for new folks because it batches all the necessary swaps into a single transaction and has a simple menu of pooling and farming options. Another super easy option is to just deposit stablecoins on Aave or Abracadabra or Maker to get yield.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-11 09:20:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ho53wlb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rdt3xc","parent_id":"t1_ho4su4i","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Claw141","body":"This is not what you want to hear but this is literally what i did not too long ago: youtube \u2018stable coin farming\u2019.

I think this is an incorrect assumption and newbies reading should be aware of the risks so they can assess and manage them appropriately. Let's walk through some. But first it's important to know where the yield is coming from. In DeFi, effectively all the yield comes from lending (most volume to leverage traders) and AMM fees (compensation for liquidity providers). The relatively high yields come from inflationary protocol token emission models that incentivize users to preform the task of providing liquidity for their protocol. Centralized platforms like Blockfi, Celsius, exchanges are more of a black box as they use other offchain strategies as well, but I assure you all of them involve some form of risk. The CEFI platforms are all under increasing regulatory scrutiny for these offerings, for instance Gensler threatening to take action against Coinbase if they even offered a stable lending product. Now if we get another extended bear, your DeFI yields are dependent on volume, which historically decreases in a bear market. The valuation of the protocol tokens used to juice yields will also be significantly less valuable. And USD at 7% inflation will also likely be less valuable. ETH would also be less valuable but your staking yield denominated in ETH is less susceptible to price movements. In a world where everything I'm talking about actually burns ETH while USD continues to print may lead to understanding why some would favor holding ETH as a part of their portfolio.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>My qualm is that this sub has all levels of understanding and knowledge about these instruments and your statements (whether intentional or not) come off as if stable farming is risk free and high yields will be stable going forward regardless of market conditions.
