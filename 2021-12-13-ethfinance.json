The 200 Day is hardly putting up a fight at 46.7k and the real next support is the 100 Week at $29.7k where all the bears&#39; wishes come true and we will be long out of a bull market by then.</p>\n\n<p>In the near term, we&#39;ve seen this distribution on the 4H before. It&#39;s one of two things, either the spring end of a Wyckoff or the start of something real bad. In both cases, there will historically be one more de-risking event over the next day or so. After that, no guarantees this doesn&#39;t drop like a rock.
