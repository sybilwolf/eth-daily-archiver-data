Omicron has been raging in SA for probably a month and a half, maybe even 2 months. Every GP and doc in SA says almost in all cases mild symptoms, most don&#39;t even realize they got covid and think they just have a cold or a mild flue.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the WHO will not, for the love of god state that in almost all cases symptoms are mild and you got retards like the UK going all ham about Omicron and plastering newspapers with 1 omicron death of which they won&#39;t even confirm the person died of omicron, if he was young or old, fat or slim, ill or not ill for all we know he got ran over by a bus while having a mild cold...</p>\n\n<p>At this point, it&#39;s just pure manipulation, some people want to crash the markets and some want to keep them afloat. Guess we will find out soon who will win.  </p>\n\n<p>Just to clarify, i am no anti vax nutter, am fully vaccinated, will take my booster as soon as possible and take covid very serious.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-16 05:05:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"horxnxv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rgs3x3","parent_id":"t1_hoqs0ll","score":0,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/towerjac","body":"G'z up hoes down","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>G&#39;z up hoes down</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-15 14:10:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hop9w1p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rgs3x3","parent_id":"t3_rgs3x3","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Zeus_Eth","body":"While you motherfuckas bounce to this.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>While you motherfuckas bounce to this.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-15 14:12:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hopa44j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rgs3x3","parent_id":"t1_hop9w1p","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-15 14:27:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hopcecj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rgs3x3","parent_id":"t1_hopa44j","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/towerjac","body":"\ud83c\udd70\ufe0f\u2795","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\ud83c\udd70\ufe0f\u2795</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-15 15:52:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hopo9j5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rgs3x3","parent_id":"t1_hopcecj","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/tislam55","body":"Imma break a brick like I break down a pound","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Imma break a brick like I break down a pound</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-15 14:49:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hopfkek","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rgs3x3","parent_id":"t1_hop9w1p","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Sfdao91","body":"gm","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>gm</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-15 02:07:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hommbqz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rgs3x3","parent_id":"t3_rgs3x3","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Capycorp","body":"Last week I learned what \u201cRey\u201d was, but now I need to learn what GM is.\n\nEdit:\nGM.
