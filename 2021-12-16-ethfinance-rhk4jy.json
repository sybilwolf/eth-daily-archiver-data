Because that's literally what it takes to 'hack' your crypto wallet without your seed phrase.\n\nI noticed the above quoted part and wanted to clear things up. Posting here as it would be buried in that post and have a better reach here. Please don't take correcting you as offensive, just want to share some insights.\n\nSHA-256 is a hash function, a one-way transformation from any length of input data to a fixed 256-bit number. A great property is that if you modify any small part of the input, the output changes radically. This makes it useful for integrity checks - e.g. chained block headers; as well as doing one-way mappings - e.g. public key to address (using the Keccak-256 hash function in Ethereum, and RIPEMD-160 in Bitcoin). Another useful property is the huge target space (256 bits), which means collisions are extremely hard to find (and have never been found yet).\n\nIf you had an address, you would first need to 'hack' this hash to get the public key. One can brute-force go through all possible inputs, apply the hash function, and see if the result matches. For 256-bit, it would take more than the lifetime of the unverse to even count through that many numbers. Quantum computers can have a speed-up for such searches, using Grover's algorithm, that takes a square-root of the time it would be required otherwise. So for 256-bit, it would be as if we have to go through a 128-bit problem (and actually it's worse due to implementation details, ~166 bits - according to this paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/992.pdf). In one word: impossible.\n\nAnother way to break it faster would be with P = NP, which is one of the biggest unsolved problems in mathematics. In a short explanation: there are different classes of problems based on how \"hard\" they are. Problems in P are solvable in reasonable (P = Polynomial) time, while those in NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial) take trillions of years with current hardware. If P = NP were to be true with a reasonable-time algorithm, it would be both extremely great (many maths theories would be solved; AI, economics, logistics, chip design would prosper) and also very bad (because current cryptography would not exist anymore). Fortunately, P = NP is very likely not true, and there also exist information-theoretically secure cryptographic constructions (not widely used, under heavy research) that are immune from this.\n\nThere is another way to get the public key though. If someone makes a transaction, it is immediately revealed so that the network can check the signature (thereby validating you own the private key), and that the hash corresponds to the address. This is a minor reason why some consider Bitcoin's UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model superior from cryptographic hygiene perspective, because an address-based model (Ethereum's) encourages address reuse, while there is no such \"constraint\" in Bitcoin. This point is moot however, because 1. you can use multiple addresses in Ethereum, 2. breaking the private key from the public key is not feasible.\n\nWith quantum computers, it is possible to decode a private key from the corresponding public key, using Shor's algorithm. Creating such a machine is at least decades away unless some huge innovation comes along. The current best quantum computers have ~200 qubits, they cannot hold their values in a stable manner for long, and also cannot act as \"real\" qubits, because only a fraction can be entangled at a time (entanglement is the real property we seek in quantum computers). ECDSA keys as used in Ethereum are 256-bit long, but to use Shor's algorithm on the discrete logarithm problem, we need 10000+ stable entangled qubits. Also have to consider error correction, which is needed due to decoherence (a fundamental quantum-level property) and noise - solving this would also require a constant factor multiple (let's say 10x) for the number of qubits. That robust machine is not even on the horizon yet.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a cryptographer, and this is my first technical post on a cryptography-related topic. Fascination with the above are partially a reason why I got into the space (I'm in it for the tech!). Let me know if something is not correct or clear.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/u/savage-dragon\">/u/savage-dragon</a>, great post in <a href=\"/r/CC\">r/CC</a>: <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rgxmtf/you_got_scammed_you_didnt_get_hacked_for_gods/\">https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rgxmtf/you_got_scammed_you_didnt_get_hacked_for_gods/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did someone suddenly invent a quantum computer capable of breaking SHA-256 cryptography?
