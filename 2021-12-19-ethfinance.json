I'm not even sure journalists understand it & if main stream media is the only thing people read about crypto they will get it even less. \n\n It's correct that Ethereum is the only Blockchain that matters but it seems that jornalists are not aware of where NFTs are stored. Otherwise why not just write Ethereum or explain it in one sentence what the Blockchain is. Are they hostile or dump? I believe they are just lazy & don't research well as they always do. \n\nThe only thing you can understand from main stream media about crypto is that Bitcoin is bad for the environment but the number of coins are limited & therefore it might protect against inflation. It's the only crypto narrative that made it to main stream so far. \n\nFor a normie to slightly understand Ethereum the person will need at least 5-10 times exposure to it through a source that explains well what it is & what it does. So far normies aren't getting any helpful exposure. \n\nWe are not even there yet where these sources are available for normies. & Most normies aren't on Twitter or Reddit where they possibly could learn about it. & YouTube won't give exposure since their algorithm exactly shows you Videos similar to the ones you watch. So if you're not actively looking for crypto you won't get the info. & If you're new & don't have any references you trust you'll probably find the terrible accounts on Twitter, YouTube & Reddit first telling you the wrong things (ADA, etc)\n\nSince Google works terrible for crypto searches you might end up with even bad information to get started.
