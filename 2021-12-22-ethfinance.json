So as one of the resident advocates for green crypto in here, I just wanted to share my opinion on the matter!\n\nIMO, energy usage is justified if it's *necessary* for some important aspect of human existence. Which is to say, there is *no better way to accomplish those needed goals.* Powering our lights? Heating our homes? Keeping our food frozen? Running hospital applications? Powering the Internet? All valid, and normal economics dictate that more efficient methods of accomplishing these things will win out over time, simply because they're lower-cost. All very well.\n\nNow take a look at the finance industry. All those gigatons of brick-and-mortar stores, energy for their lights and servers and everything. A huge cost, and one that *was* necessary for finance to function.\n\nEnter Bitcoin. Now we have a method that allows us to maintain a distributed ledger independently, much more globally, and crucially *more efficiently* than the previous brick-and-mortar implementation. A breakthrough on all accounts. \n\nIMO, in that moment, all functions of banks that could be replaced by Bitcoin became *bad* from an environmental perspective. There now existed *better solutions* that could accomplish those functions for much lower energy usage. At least in theory, because of course Bitcoin could not scale to actually replace all of those usages...\n\nYou probably can now see where I'm going with this.\n\nEnter Ethereum, which can replicate *all* of the functions of the financial system, and add vast quantities of new ones. Suddenly *all* of traditional finance has become an ecological disaster compared to Bitcoin + Ethereum, not just distributed leger functionality. Again, under the assumption that crypto could scale to actually take on those loads.\n\nAnd finally, enter PoS. With this one innovation, Proof of Work has itself become outdated, and an environmental evil that must be defeated, *because there now exist better solutions that can accomplish the same task for 1/2000th of the energy usage*. Proof of Work isn't bad in and of itself, but by comparison with what our new technology has created, it's an absurdly wasteful and irrelevant technology that needs to die as soon as possible. We can replace absolutely everything with a global settlement layer (and its L2s) running on PoS.\n\nNow, of course there's one nuance I haven't captured here, which is that PoS does not actually exist yet. There are a million dPoS chains, but those are not actually decentralized and therefore do not actually solve anything. Ethereum's true PoS is still six months out. So until that moment comes, I don't really think Etheruem's PoW is an environmental disaster, because *it's currently the best we have*. I *do* fully cancel Bitcoin because of PoW, because it has zero plans to upgrade to PoS. It's dead to me without that roadmap. It has committed itself to wanton waste in the face of a vastly superior consensus mechanism, and is no better than those people who like to \"roll coal\" for the fun of it, or whatever - they're just burning energy to see the world burn, IMO. Ethereum, by comparison, is getting away from PoW as fast as it can.\n\nSo anyway, that's why I take the energy consumption concerns of PoW extremely seriously. It was revolutionary and a huge potential energy savings versus tradfi... until something three orders of magnitude better came along, and now it's ancient tech that, whenever a chain refuses to upgrade away from it, represents willful and abhorrent damage to the environment. In my opinion.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The energy usage concerns of crypto got brought up below, and it seemed like a lot of folks wanted to be dismissive of them. So as one of the resident advocates for green crypto in here, I just wanted to share my opinion on the matter!</p>\n\n<p>IMO, energy usage is justified if it&#39;s <em>necessary</em> for some important aspect of human existence. Which is to say, there is <em>no better way to accomplish those needed goals.</em> Powering our lights? Heating our homes? Keeping our food frozen? Running hospital applications? Powering the Internet? All valid, and normal economics dictate that more efficient methods of accomplishing these things will win out over time, simply because they&#39;re lower-cost. All very well.</p>\n\n<p>Now take a look at the finance industry. All those gigatons of brick-and-mortar stores, energy for their lights and servers and everything. A huge cost, and one that <em>was</em> necessary for finance to function.</p>\n\n<p>Enter Bitcoin. Now we have a method that allows us to maintain a distributed ledger independently, much more globally, and crucially <em>more efficiently</em> than the previous brick-and-mortar implementation. A breakthrough on all accounts. </p>\n\n<p>IMO, in that moment, all functions of banks that could be replaced by Bitcoin became <em>bad</em> from an environmental perspective. There now existed <em>better solutions</em> that could accomplish those functions for much lower energy usage. At least in theory, because of course Bitcoin could not scale to actually replace all of those usages...</p>\n\n<p>You probably can now see where I&#39;m going with this.</p>\n\n<p>Enter Ethereum, which can replicate <em>all</em> of the functions of the financial system, and add vast quantities of new ones. Suddenly <em>all</em> of traditional finance has become an ecological disaster compared to Bitcoin + Ethereum, not just distributed leger functionality. Again, under the assumption that crypto could scale to actually take on those loads.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, enter PoS. With this one innovation, Proof of Work has itself become outdated, and an environmental evil that must be defeated, <em>because there now exist better solutions that can accomplish the same task for 1/2000th of the energy usage</em>. Proof of Work isn&#39;t bad in and of itself, but by comparison with what our new technology has created, it&#39;s an absurdly wasteful and irrelevant technology that needs to die as soon as possible. We can replace absolutely everything with a global settlement layer (and its L2s) running on PoS.</p>\n\n<p>Now, of course there&#39;s one nuance I haven&#39;t captured here, which is that PoS does not actually exist yet. There are a million dPoS chains, but those are not actually decentralized and therefore do not actually solve anything. Ethereum&#39;s true PoS is still six months out. So until that moment comes, I don&#39;t really think Etheruem&#39;s PoW is an environmental disaster, because <em>it&#39;s currently the best we have</em>. I <em>do</em> fully cancel Bitcoin because of PoW, because it has zero plans to upgrade to PoS. It&#39;s dead to me without that roadmap. It has committed itself to wanton waste in the face of a vastly superior consensus mechanism, and is no better than those people who like to &quot;roll coal&quot; for the fun of it, or whatever - they&#39;re just burning energy to see the world burn, IMO. Ethereum, by comparison, is getting away from PoW as fast as it can.</p>\n\n<p>So anyway, that&#39;s why I take the energy consumption concerns of PoW extremely seriously. It was revolutionary and a huge potential energy savings versus tradfi... until something three orders of magnitude better came along, and now it&#39;s ancient tech that, whenever a chain refuses to upgrade away from it, represents willful and abhorrent damage to the environment.

The rest are sponsored by the corresponding projects, with 40,000 RICE rewards for RICE/USDT, 150,000 MOVD rewards for MOVD/ETH and 1,225,000 DEP rewards for DEP/ETH.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*AASX7PgtuchDviXwWJv3Ig.png\">Trading Pairs</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.loopring.io/loopring-holiday-trading-giveaway-600-000-in-prizes-4644abf5aa2e\">https://medium.loopring.io/loopring-holiday-trading-giveaway-600-000-in-prizes-4644abf5aa2e</a></p>\n\n<p>Assuming you&#39;d need a huge stack to get anywhere but couldn&#39;t you just swap back and forth to stable coins 10000 times?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-22 10:12:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hpl1b44","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rlyik8","parent_id":"t3_rlyik8","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Hanzburger","body":"> couldn't you just swap back and forth to stable coins 10000 times?\n\nI'm sure that's exactly what will happen","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>couldn&#39;t you just swap back and forth to stable coins 10000 times?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure that&#39;s exactly what will happen</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-22 11:33:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hpldcvd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rlyik8","parent_id":"t1_hpl1b44","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/need-a-bencil","body":"None of the listed pairs are stable pairs.
