I am in the United States and I have some USDC that I would like to sell for USD and withdraw to my bank account.  I&#39;m wondering what the cheapest way to do this is.</p>\n\n<p>1) Send USDC from wallet to Coinbase and then sell it on Coinbase for USD?</p>\n\n<p>2) Use USDC to buy ETH, send to Coinbase Pro and then sell for USD?</p>\n\n<p>3) Perhaps send USDC from wallet to Coinbase Pro and then sell for USD? ( Not sure if this is possible )</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.  In the meantime I&#39;ll continue looking for a Coinbase fees document that actually makes sense.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-23 15:06:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hpqot47","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rmoqo3","parent_id":"t3_rmoqo3","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptrd285","body":"I am pretty sure usdc to usd conversion is free on coinbase","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am pretty sure usdc to usd conversion is free on coinbase</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-23 15:08:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hpqp0rn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rmoqo3","parent_id":"t1_hpqot47","score":31,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Lustful_lurker69","body":"This is accurate.
