Here's the post:\n\n*One fun part about being a Scotsman is we have time-traveling abilities using wormholes in the space-time continuum. The following is a Wikipedia article that will be published sometime in 2025*:\n\nThe Ethereum Gold Rush (2022\u20132024) was a rush to purchase Ether cryptocurrency that began on January 15, 2022, when news of the approximate Ethereum merge date was announced by Ethereum core devs. The announcement of the merge date brought a rush of approximately 300 million retail and institutional investors to Ethereum from so-called \u201cETH killers,\u201d dog coins, and other L1 crypto networks, pushing the price of ETH to over 100,000 USD. The sudden influx of purchases into the ETH money supply reinvigorated the global cryptocurrency bull market, and the sudden buying demand increase allowed Ethereum to rapidly \u201cflippen\u201d Bitcoin, vaulting to the number one cryptocurrency network by market capitalization. The Ethereum Gold Rush had severe effects on competing \u201cETH killer\u201d L1 networks, such as Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche, and accelerated the Bitcoin maximalist decline by replacing Bitcoin as so-called \u201csound money\u201d with EIP-1559, switching to proof of stake (and thereby defeating the \u201cProof of Work is obliterating the environment\u201d narrative), and scaling to thousands of transactions per second with roll-ups and eventually sharding.\n\nThe effects of the Ethereum Gold Rush were substantial. Whole communities of cringe bitcoin maximalists were posting YouTube videos and Twitter takes about ETH being \u201cVC-owned\u201d and \u201ccentralized,\u201d but they were ultimately laughed at and abandoned by the so-called ETH-seekers, whose motto became \u201cThis is the Gwei\u201d (referring to the popular phrase from the HBO show The Mandalorian, and gwei, the smallest base unit for Ether, equivalent to satoshis for Bitcoin). Outside of original ETH hodlers, the first significant groups of investors to arrive were through institutional retirement funds, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu hodlers (see The 2022 Dogcoin Collapse, and boomers who had previously been skeptical of Web3. Of the approximately 300 million people who purchased ETH during the Ethereum Gold Rush, about half specified the 90% reduction in ETH issuance and ETH burned by EIP-1559 as their primary reasons for buying, and half specified the Ethereum network effects (including developer interest and the unassailable head start on inverting the Blockchain trilemma) as their reason for switching their bets from alternative layer 1 networks. Even so, ETH-seekers often faced substantial ridicule from trad-fi normies for their purchases. While most of the newly arrived were first-time investors, the Ethereum gold rush attracted millions from Dogecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, and even Bitcoin. Centralized exchanges and decentralized staking services expanded throughout the web3 metaverse to meet the buying and staking demands of the ETH-seekers. Rocket Pool grew from a small protocol of about 62,000 ETH staked in December 2021 to a boomtown of about 16 million ETH staked by 2024. Hundreds of DeFi applications, quadratic funding to combat climate change and fund other public goods, decentralized and provably secure voting and other apps were built out on the ETH network. In 2023, the International Monetary Fund announced plans to adopt ETH as a reserve asset. The new asset was adopted by referendum vote. In September 2024, ETH officially became money.\n\nAt the beginning of the Ethereum Gold Rush, barrier to entry for independent ETH staking (i.e. running your own validator) was high, and so a system of \"decentralized staking claims\" was developed. Prospectors retrieved the ETH from decentralized staking protocols such as Rocket Pool by depositing to a smart contract. Although Proof of Work mining caused environmental harm, more sophisticated methods of decentralized consensus mechanisms were developed and later adopted around the cryptocurrency landscape, including in the 2022 ETH merge. New methods of scaling developed as optimistic and zk roll-ups came into regular service. By 2022, roll-ups were built by Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync . At its peak, technological advances reached a point where significant web2 employment and financing was diverted, increasing the proportion of web3 companies relative to web2 legacy institutions. ETH worth tens of trillions of today's US dollars was hoarded, which led to great wealth for many, though some who participated in the early Ethereum Gold Rush earned little more than they had started with by using leverage (and subsequently getting liquidated) and assuming the bull market had ended in December 2021.\n\n*In case it wasn\u2019t self-evident, this is a\u2026 half-parody of the first 3 paragraphs of the California Gold Rush Wikipedia article. Tongue-in-cheek predictions are my own. Not financial advice.*\n\nSubstack article: [https://truescotsman.substack.com/p/the-ethereum-gold-rush](https://truescotsman.substack.com/p/the-ethereum-gold-rush)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I started a substack to write silly things every so often.
