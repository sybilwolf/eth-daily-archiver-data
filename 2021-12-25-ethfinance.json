Of course I would not give my personal email but some disposable spam email (yopmail). I chose a crypto related email. \n\nGoing to this email (open to anybody) I would find the download link for the white paper. But they were other email with [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com) reset and email for a crypto platform I never heard before called Fri\\*\\*\\* (I will hide the name for now).\n\nCould it be that somebody would use a public email for login to crypto platform. That would be quite stupid. Could it be possible? So I look into it and of course I can reset the user/password on Fri\\*\\*. The platform is an exchange that looks quite legit and to my surprise there is 0.58BTC or almost 30k.. That's crazy. Is that for real?\n\nSo I look more in the platform. It is really well done and feels like a real platform until I start looking at the trading. Trading is not working and you can only click up and down which throws an error asking to contact support. In the support here is the interesting part. There is a conversation with a previous user asking why he can't transfer to an external wallet. The response from support is as follow: \n\n>You need to verify your address, where you are going to withdraw your funds. You should make a deposit from your external address. Minimal amount of the deposit is 0.01 BTC. More information you can get in User Agreement.\n\nAll of this elaborate scheme for greedy people to think they can just verify their address to withdraw 30K.

Of course I would not give my personal email but some disposable spam email (yopmail). I chose a crypto related email. </p>\n\n<p>Going to this email (open to anybody) I would find the download link for the white paper. But they were other email with <a href=\"https://Blockchain.com\">Blockchain.com</a> reset and email for a crypto platform I never heard before called Fri*** (I will hide the name for now).</p>\n\n<p>Could it be that somebody would use a public email for login to crypto platform. That would be quite stupid. Could it be possible? So I look into it and of course I can reset the user/password on Fri**. The platform is an exchange that looks quite legit and to my surprise there is 0.58BTC or almost 30k.. That&#39;s crazy. Is that for real?</p>\n\n<p>So I look more in the platform. It is really well done and feels like a real platform until I start looking at the trading. Trading is not working and you can only click up and down which throws an error asking to contact support. In the support here is the interesting part. There is a conversation with a previous user asking why he can&#39;t transfer to an external wallet. The response from support is as follow: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You need to verify your address, where you are going to withdraw your funds. You should make a deposit from your external address. Minimal amount of the deposit is 0.01 BTC. More information you can get in User Agreement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All of this elaborate scheme for greedy people to think they can just verify their address to withdraw 30K.
