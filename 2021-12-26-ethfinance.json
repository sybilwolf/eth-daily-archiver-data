One of the arguments for the continued growth and value accrual of alt L1s vs SED is that users don't care about decentralization and just want to use what is cheap and convenient, and for a variety of reasons the alt L1s will be cheap enough and more convenient than L2s. \n\nThis argument makes enough sense at first glance. Take Solana for example. It's got easy fiat on-ramps, a burgeoning app ecosystem, and low fees. It's got higher TVL than any Ethereum L2 and shows strong usage growth. It could chip away at market share and attract users at a higher rate than L2s until it has a good network effect before L2s get fully deployed and take their training wheels off. Sure, the Solana foundation can shut it off whenever they want and there's no culture of users verifying the chain with non-block-producing nodes, but who cares?\n\nIMO, the issue with this take is two-fold. The crux is of my disagreement is who the modal blockchain user will be and whose preferences successful networks should cater to. According to this take, the little guy who will be the modal network user will simultaneously not care about decentralization and will actively manage their own funds to find the juiciest ponzies and pfp projects possible via Discord and Twitter. These users will happily play L1 musical chairs for the next 10x. There have been many new network users over the past year that fit this description, so that must continue forever. \n\nThis seems patently false to me. As Not Early as we are at this point, future growth in network useage will dwarf current usage, and most individuals will more or less continue to interact with their assets in the way they do now: with clean UIs and mobile apps and mostly to make retail purchases and occasionally invest, borrow, or send/receive money to/from other individuals. As \"convenient\" as alt L1s are, they are not as convenient as current centralized services. Digital goods will play a larger role and NFTs are here to stay, but pfp speculators and pnd yield farmers won't be a large sector of digital economy.\n\nNo user of blockchain networks today represents the modal individual user in the future imo. The modal user will interact with blockchains indirectly with services described above and not even know which network they are using. Therefore, whichever networks those services decide to build on will ultimate have the highest usage and value accrual. And I believe that the priorities of those services are very different than those of current users of alt L1s. As has been discussed numerous times on here before, large financial entities do value security and will build on the most secure networks, even if less secure networks build modest network effects. Modulare SED framework will enable these services will provide both more secure and cheaper services for their users than available in monolithic chains, and since settlement costs will be negligible relative to other costs, there is no good reason for those services not to settle on the most secure S layer available. A good example of this is Visa building a payment platform on top of Ethereum. \n\nSo the TLDR is that I think extrapolating from the recent growth of L1s is myopic and makes unrealistic assumptions about the priorities of the future model blockchain market participant in a world where most global economic activity is settled on blockchains.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am trying to clarify some thoughts of mine prompted by some Twitter arguments around alt L1s vs. L2s (or modular settlement, execution, data [SED] layers).
