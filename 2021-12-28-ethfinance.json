But I believe we are still far away from another DeFi season. Why? Cause I need we need some things to be in place before DeFi will explode again.   \n\\- We need one roll up with all dapps that are right now on ETH mainnet --> one composable roll up that allows you to use all the applications you know. Right now, there are too many apps missing because they are spread over the different execution layers. I guess Maker / DAI issuance is also a must have, I think there was news/ rumours about AAVE also issuing DAI, if that happens, it could work as well, but I guess you get my point. Lending/ borrowing + yield farming / liquidity mining  \n\\- Liquidity mining could also be sparked by RU-tokens. I guess we will need incentives to kick start liquidity on the different RU and of course a mix of application tokens and RU tokens would be huge.   \n\n2. **Photography NFTs won't take off**  \nI've been reading a lot about photography being the next big thing. While I think the market could be bigger than I think, I don't think it fits the current (degen) audience. I just can't see people spending double digit ETH for a pic. Now obviously that what the \"jpg\" meme is about as well and people have spent thousands of dollars for profile pictures. Still I would put photos in the same category as 1/1 and that hasn't really taken off and is rather niche. I actually think 1/1 are more likely to gain traction than photography. I'll still pay attention but am not planning to make any investments since I don't really get the idea and hence wouldn't trust myself to make good calls on what to buy.   \n\n3. **Gaming / GameFi won't take off**  \nThis one is more interesting and probably more controversial. I can see a lot of okay-ish games. I can't see a game that will really take off. The biggest problem here is that the initial investment right now is still way too high. Example Axie: I know that some months ago you needed to spend 0.3 ETH for 3 axies to even start the game. Now it's closer to 0.05-0.06 ETH (200$) which of course is already a significant improvement, but still it's too high for newbies. Similar story with defikingdoms etc. The game mechanics are cool and it makes a lot of sense to play some of the games, but a banger to kickstart the whole genre won't launch in 2022.   \nOn top we have to admit that the audience to make it happen is still very much against NFTs. Just this is probably enough to make all games pure speculation and it's speculation by the same crypto niche that already gambles with shitcoins and PFP NFTs etc.   \nI think we need a very easy game that includes NFTs without really calling them NFT to make games more popular. I still believe this will be something like Hearthstone / MTG because it is easy to monetize, easy to create, people understand the mechanics and could even understand the USP (you can really trade your cards and build a deck, just like you could with your IRL friends). This will probably also be dependent on a great execution layer.   \n\n4. **UX/ Infrastructure narrative**  \nI think this is really the next big thing. Things like cross-execution layer infrastructure, account abstraction, Login with Ethereum, L2-mobile (smart contract) wallets with on and (!) off-ramp etc. will be huge in 2022.  I don't think we will get to the point where people only use applications without understanding on which chain that protocol is located etc. But I think those protocols that improve UX and hence allow for more mainstream adoption will perform very well in 2022. If UX improves with the merge and a potential connected release of 4488 then we also have a perfect execution layer storm that could lead to a post-merge blow off top.   \nAs you can see this is all pretty ETH heavy. I think this could also be the top for alt L1s that will perform well until the merge.  \n\n5. **Merge = top**  \nFrom a cycle/ financial point of view I still believe that the merge or the period afterwards will be the top, most likely a blow off top that will take us into a at least 12 month bear market.   \nThe supply shock will be incredible, but at one point smart/ institutional investors/ market makers will take profits and will drive the market down again. There's not gonna be a supercycle, this market is not mature enough, both because ETHs valuation but also the general market valuation will be too high.   \nMy guess is that we will see a 80% crash for ETH, more for alts. At the same time we will probably see cycles within the cycle, so some categories will perform reasonably well and the overall market correlation will fall. \n\nThis is again just me structuring my thoughts, this is not meant to be advice.
