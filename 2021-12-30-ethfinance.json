The last 3 of my friends I had at the start of this year have all left for other parts of the country and I&#39;m on-call for work this weekend so can&#39;t go out of town to catch up with people.</p>\n\n<p>I think 2022 will be the year I move out too. I need a fresh start and I&#39;m probably going to be bringing in the new year with my ETH fam right here in the EthFinance daily as I have nobody else to celebrate it with this year.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully I can leave a desk crap just before I leave for Hodlercon but I&#39;m gonna need an $8k ETH first. My forecast is that there is a high probability of a shitty desk in my bosses office before Hodlercon.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-30 18:05:06","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-12-30 18:09:02","id":"hqmna54","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rru7pv","parent_id":"t1_hqm9ywm","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/RestStopRumble","body":"\ud83e\udd17","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\ud83e\udd17</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-30 18:11:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hqmo2d0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rru7pv","parent_id":"t1_hqmna54","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/the-A-word","body":"Same...I wont be glued to charts or anything stressing but I'll def be Dootin the Diddly into the wee hours with our ethfi fam!!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Same...I wont be glued to charts or anything stressing but I&#39;ll def be Dootin the Diddly into the wee hours with our ethfi fam!!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-30 19:02:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hqmutnt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rru7pv","parent_id":"t1_hqmna54","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"This is definitely the wei.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is definitely the wei.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-30 19:11:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hqmvvak","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rru7pv","parent_id":"t1_hqmutnt","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/RestStopRumble","body":"Yea but wen moon","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yea but wen moon</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-30 16:48:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hqmcxya","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rru7pv","parent_id":"t1_hqm9ywm","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/TheLeccy","body":"Happy new year to you, you're insight is greatly valued here.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Happy new year to you, you&#39;re insight is greatly valued here.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-30 17:37:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hqmjn3t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rru7pv","parent_id":"t1_hqm9ywm","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"ON-COR!
