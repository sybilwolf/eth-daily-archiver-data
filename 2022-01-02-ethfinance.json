But now optimistic roll-up L2s are here, some zk-rollups too and general purpose StarkNet is right around the corner.  In 2022 the Ethereum community will come under the most pressure ever to prove L2s are the future for blockchain scaling vs approaches taken by MATIC, FTM, SOL, DOT, ALGO, ADA, ONE, AVAX, LUNA, ATOM, something entirely new, etc, especially as some of these other networks get more decentralized (though none will be as decentralized as ETH by EoY). As an Ethereum staker myself, I&#39;m putting my money where my mouth is in saying that I do think the Ethereum ecosystem and the L2 scaling narrative will ultimately prevail, but it will be a tough slog that will likely play out both over social media and in the markets.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-02 19:34:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hr0zz40","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ru34mk","parent_id":"t3_ru34mk","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/forbothofus","body":"All in all, sounds like a pretty sweet year!
