A bunch of other randomly selected validators ('committee') check that everything is OK and vote based on their findings.\n\nSo what's the problem? Something known as *maximal/miner extractable value (MEV)*. I see MEV as the maximum profit the *block* ***builder*** (i.e. they who decide what transactions go in the next block in what order) can squeeze out of the network by 'abusing' their power. Examples:\n\n* Someone on Binance makes a big ETH purchase upping the price there while Uniswap did not move? MEV opportunity by making sure my transaction is first to arbitrage.\n* Price movement causes a whale account of some on-chain lending market (i.e. AAVE) to be eligible for liquidation (with a fat liquidation-bonus). I'll take that bonus, thank you! Oh? The whale in question submitted a transaction to repay some debt in the same block? Too bad it's behind my transaction *since I have the sole right to order/include them.*\n* Any front-runnable transaction that is profitable and in the public mempool, [even obscure ones](https://zengo.com/ethology-a-safari-tour-in-ethereums-dark-forest)? Indeed.\n\nOn a 'world computer' like Ethereum MEV can get incredibly complex (and profitable). And herein lies the problem. A validator who is better at MEV than average will be more profitable (gaining power/influence). Validators that bundle resources can offer better MEV services (economy of scale). Validators with more compute power could do better block building (rising hardware requirements). etc. etc. Centralization vectors on an existential scale!\n\nWith PBS, this (seemingly unavoidable) centralization is isolated by taking the block building rights away from validators to an in-protocol auction open to all. It is highly likely that a few centralized builder-entities will completely dominate this auction. Validators only have to pick the right auction winner and take their bid as reward. No more MEV centralization for validators (and the rest of the protocol).\n\nIt is important to note that this particular centralization aspect is currently suspected of being fundamental to any state-rich chain like Ethereum/BSC/Solana/... (and rollups). *But also that there is still the same immense value in the rest of the protocol being as decentralized as possible.*\n\nConsequences of MEV centralization are less visible today because they have been preempted by an Ethereum/MEV research organization known as [Flashbots](https://docs.flashbots.net/). They currently host a big builder-entity by communicating/negotiating with individual mining pools. Any small MEV seeker can privately send their transactions to them for 'fair' inclusion.\n\nOf course this is no long-term solution, especially when going from a dozen known mining pools with PoW, to 240K (anonymous by default) validators with PoS. Hence the need for PBS.\n\nSo there it is.

See, I tried and failed to see any medium term correlations between crypto and other markets. Equities, commodities, memes, yields. Nearly everything ended up being noise when we most needed guidance. So fuck 'em. We'll watch the other markets of course, but I won't be doing anything under a weekly scale if that and won't mention them unless there's some event like a huge rise or fall.\n\nFor a final long-term report: SPY ended the year near ATHs (and we did not, haha). The S&P finished up something wild like 27%. The subsequent year following a 20+% year? ... is surprisingly bullish, historically, just not crazy or anything. Data suggests a delightful 7% average gain. Major lenders are expecting 7-9%. Past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. And there was not a single 10% correction in 2021. So if that history were to fail, this would be the year. But, no reason to really worry right now. The SPY is bulling out of a bull pattern as we speak. And speaking of speak, let's not speak of it much anymore.\n\nAs for the DXY and 10Y yields? Those have not yet failed me in a medium term fashion yet and so, while also weekly-ish, I want to track them a little while longer.\n\nI think crypto wants long-term, secular downward movement on fiat to continue bulling. Forget those spikes of last year. The dollar IS still rolling over. [Consider today's 4H candle smacking against this line.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/n2vdKuWY/) I drew that line on [a weekly chart months ago](https://www.tradingview.com/x/loPVScrf/) if anyone remembers. It's valid and so I'm very curious/excited to see what happens during a final fiat bear if we're so lucky to get one.\n\nSame for the US10Y bond yields. They haven't entirely failed yet. [Look at this delicious daily breakout.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/m1vhsGOt/) We saw such a breakout end of September with a golden cross and a week later crypto followed. The 10Y is currently *heading* for (but not yet at) a golden cross. If these candles are to be correlated with us, the range for a crypto breakout is fast approaching. Roughly starting this Wednesday to about next Mon/Tues. Yes yes, classic crypto weekend prayer. But if this really fails, I'm relegating it to the stocks pile all the same. No more room for noise.\n\nSo what AM I gonna be watching? The thing that has kept me as calm as cauliflower this whole December dump... a crypto focus on a crypto market. Dominance, ratio, and options.\n\n........\n\nOPTIONS?! KBROT ARE YOU FUCKING STUPID?! CALM?!\n\nHey, the 70/30 rule continues to dominate crypto. It keeps closing within a range. In fact this crab event has been so predictable it's been closer to 95% in feel. Covered calls have been making serious cashmoneybank. And it really calms the nerves on out-of-nowhere dumps and pumps, making my holidays rather nice.\n\nPor ejemplo, [today's expiry makes it more expensive for BTC to close below 46k.](https://nimb.ws/ImivJ7) Doesn't mean it can't. Just means it's more likely it doesn't. Put walls up at the max pain of 47k and 46k. A slightly bearish put/call skew of 0.71 (I'll talk about this in a sec) suggests it'll close a little bit *under* max pain. Now, just like smaller timeframes are less useful on charts, DAILY expiry is pretty useless. Volume really begins at the weekly and is most important on the quarterlies. I think I'll discuss daily with a heaping helping of salt and get discussion going there, while actually caring about weekly and up.\n\nThere's gonna be a lot to talk about here because I'm new to watching options. That put/call skew is something you and I are gonna be watching and analyzing and learning about together. In equities, 0.7 is considered the line between bearish and bullish sentiment. Why, when 1.0 is equal number of puts and calls (sells and buys) being traded? Because all markets have an optimistic bias. I don't know who came up with 0.7 as the compromise to this bias, but a lot of analysts (all that I follow on YT and blogs) use it hence I'm using it as my starting point. I think crypto will disappoint as it's far more hopelessly optimistic than any other asset and expect we might want skews below 0.5 maybe even 0.4. But I want to watch this with y'all. Gonna make a spreadsheet for daily, weekly, quarterly expectations.\n\nDominance: [grandpa is straight-up cliffing.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CRndGUf0/) Historically low levels. Either we get our promised Q1 alt sETHson (pronounced like \"season\") or BTC is likely to turn volatile. Volatility can mean pump or dump, of course, as long as grandpa wrenches back his dominance. 39.75 is a major level to watch the next few days.\n\nThis post is already a tome and ratio is self-explanatory. Just to say, I'll be back to focusing on it.\n\nLFG so GLF (Grandpa Languishes Flipped)!\n\nCheers!\n\nedit:\n\n>LFG so GLF (Grandpa Languishes Flipped)!\n\nso that Grandpa IS Languishing Flipped!

There could be a recursive proof that verifies a million transactions and it would still only cost 1 million gas to verify in Ethereum  </p>\n\n<p>- Is a big step forward for the space because now we&#39;re measuring recursive proof generation time in miliseconds, not seconds  </p>\n\n<p>- Has achieved 170ms recursive proof generation on a Macbook Pro  </p>\n\n<p>- Is the fastest implementation of recursive proofs ever and it works natively on Ethereum  </p>\n\n<p>Zk-rollups will compete on speed and on cost and Polygon Zero believe they have the most scalable EVM compatible zk layer 2.  </p>\n\n<p>Their goal is to allow developers to compile existing solidity code to run effectively unchanged on a zkEVM, providing scalability without compromising decentralization or security</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a link to the presentation: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Tb5ExY8h4Lg?t=2174\">https://youtu.be/Tb5ExY8h4Lg?t=2174</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-03 19:25:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hr5zlmn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ruulob","parent_id":"t3_ruulob","score":30,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/lb-sntp","body":"Don\u2019t forget to uptoot the Butalik in 2022.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Don\u2019t forget to uptoot the Butalik in 2022.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-03 00:00:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hr1s6te","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ruulob","parent_id":"t3_ruulob","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Dootalik","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Dootalik</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-03 01:10:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hr1xj5g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ruulob","parent_id":"t1_hr1s6te","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethrevolution","body":"upshart the pootalik","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>upshart the pootalik</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-03 03:36:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hr28r14","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ruulob","parent_id":"t1_hr1xj5g","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Papazio","body":"I was once incorrect on this same point but that was around a year ago and it is a shame to still see it being repeated. \n\nAs I understand it today, ETH stakes and rewards will not be withdraw-able until a further fork after the merge.

So here we go. Some rambling thoughts. I made [a prediction post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rkg6bg/daily_general_discussion_december_20_2021/hpczkvc/) a bit ago looking ahead to 2022. One of those predictions is a change to how DAOs manage their Pool-2 incentives.\n\nHere's the basic conundrum. You start a DAO. Neat, go you! The *singular* advantage you have as part of your DAO is the ability to make a token. You have a *monopoly* over your token. Unfortunately, your DAO has services you need. You need to spend on marketing, establish an active voter base and community, get partnerships with other DAO's, and of course pay yourselves.\n\nThe only thing you have is a pile of tokens and (hopefully) a working product. Unfortunately for you, people keeping selling the tokens you hand out! They keep buying ETH with it; how dare they?! If there isn't liquidity to sell it into, this drives the price of your dear token ever downward. As the price falls, you need to give more and more of your tokens out to get people to do things for you. This creates a death spiral. You either run out of tokens or become a banana republic. Welcome to being a DAO.\n\nWhat can you do? Obviously the perfect answer is **growth**. It's possible to grow so fast you generate hype. Hype creates buy pressure that you can sell into. Great! This only works until the hype dies though. Show me a project that has kept active hype alive for a few solid years. YAM lasted about 2 days on hype. Olympus, a few months. What else we got? What distribution mechanisms or tools are out there that reduce the sell pressure per issuance and keep the price up?\n\nYou can delay selling pressure using **time locks**. This gives people time to actually evaluate your project before having to choose to sell it. Some projects like Illuvium and MStable vest their rewards over many months. Curve did their airdrop vesting over a year. Worked out well for them. I find time locks *annoying* and usually they don't change my decision on whether to sell liquidity rewards. So, while the pain is deferred a bit it's at the cost of user experience and it doesn't change the fundamental calculus unless you succeed at rapidly growing while I'm locked.\n\nA different take on a time lock are **bonds** like Olympus Pro instead of straight token payments. Let's say your token expense has to remain the same between issuance and bonds. In the case of token issuance that token is definitely getting sold. On the other hand, with a bond there's only so much it can drop. If it is sold faster than the discount on the bond the DAO can actually afford to use the bonded asset to buy back the token *and* keep a profit. In a *weird* way bonds are basically a short position on the token you're handing out. This changes the game theory as a receiver in important ways. If everyone wants to take the token and sell it, then the DAO wins its short position. Think of it like a *conditional payment*.\n\nAnother take on conditional payments are **KPI's**. Rather than issuing tokens, let people farm KPIs with payment conditional on the effect of services rendered. This also inherently includes some form of time lock because the KPI has an expiration. The downside here is people are going to *greatly* discount the value of the KPI so your net issuance is probably going to end up being higher. At least you'll be sure to get measurable benefit for the expense though.\n\nYou can offer **prize pools**. Set aside a pool of rewards, let any number of people compete for them and raffle off the rewards. Kucoin embraces this kind of incentive a lot for their social marketing. I don't have the numbers for whether participation is higher with this or pro-rata reward structures. I usually choose not to participate at all rather than participate in raffles.\n\nGoing a different route, you can try to issue your token to people with stronger hands e.g. **VCs** and other DAOs. These entities are proven to hodl those tokens better than the locusts but unfortunately this runs counter to building a decentralized community using your rewards. I get it though, all you have is a pile of tokens and strong hands at the start are a blessing hard to come by any other way.\n\nEverything above is aimed at reducing sell pressure. Of those, I think bonds are the most interesting. The other side of this equation is to deepen the liquidity pool so selling has less impact. How are you going to do that? You can't just make your own Uniswap v3 position because you don't have ETH to match your token. So, the standard answer is to bootstrap with liquidity mining. Unfortunately, this is giving your token to some of the weakest hands possible just to pay for liquidity. What other options are there? Enter two actually reasonable alternatives that allow for one-sided liquidity.\n\n1) Bancor\n\n2) Tokemak\n\nBoth of these are well positioned to revolutionize the Pool-2 market and capture extraordinary DAO TVL.

How did I do?\n\nWell, at the time the price was about the same as today so I did miss out on some lackluster liquidity mining. However, look at the liquidity on their [analytics page](https://analytics.kyberswap.com/home). Pre-LM it minned out around $12M. During their LM splurge, they peaked at about $400M. Not bad right? LM ended and it went down to $24M. So, let's say they retained $12M in liquidity.\n\nFor that $12M in adoption they spent about 15M KNC which at ~$1.2 is about $18M in marketing. So they spent $1.5 in marketing for every $1 of retention. I'm going to call that an abysmal failure. To put that in perspective, rather than an LM program they should have just made a bond program and bought $18M in liquidity and owned it outright. After that exercise they capitulated and just became another dex aggregator like Matcha or 1inch.

Their capture rate is currently 0, but let's say for the sake of argument they do the Sushi thing and capture 1/6 as fees. That gives them protocol revenue in the $5M range. Token market cap $143M. Already overpriced before accounting for any issuance. But they actually made an entirely new token for the specific purpose of diluting it with rewards. I'll leave the rest up to your imagination.\n\nSo it turns out if I had held and had someone willing to pay me 100% APR I would have done *ok*. But the actual yield was sub 5% for staking and voting and the opportunity cost of not buying Illuvium, Convex, Curve, etc means I would have lost out on about 300% gains + farming rewards.
