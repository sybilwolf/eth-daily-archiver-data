I'm not saying they were lying when they said they didn't know him. But I *am* saying that I want a podcast about DeFi to discuss interesting stuff happening in DeFi. The whole MIM/UST degenbox on Abracadabra, for instance, is something interesting happening recently in the world of DeFi and I would want to hear about it. To me it seems like Bankless is not discussing these things because it involves other blockchains than Ethereum. And that's to tribal for me. \n\nThe rise of Luna and UST especially was something that they ignored for far too long. They call themselves \"decentralisation maxis\", but when a decentralized stablecoin gains traction, they completely ignore it. To be clear: I have my reservations about UST and I'm not promoting it. But I've had to get my information on it from other places.

There is no one you can sue to correct your mistake. There is no one the government can point a gun at to get your money back. There is no FDIC insurance that is going to bail you out. Once you are in custody of your funds, if you fuck something up, it is literally gone forever. Take this seriously.\u201d\n\nIn my few short years in Defi I have personally narrowly dodged half a dozen hacks and been caught in at least two. When a hack does happen I\u2019ll usually track down the technical retrospective just out of morbid curiosity even if I wasn\u2019t affected. I am someone with decades of software background who has audited contracts personally before putting money in. I know enough Solidity to at least have written my own Defi project and to recognize the code origin many projects are forked from. Despite all of that, I have still been caught out more than once. Suffice to say, if I can\u2019t see it coming the majority of investors are hopelessly out of their depth. Seasoned veterans in this space will resonate with this next statement. Even if you do everything right sometimes you can still lose. So, let\u2019s talk a bit about what this ecosystem does *when things go wrong*.\n\n> \u201cIt is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness\u2014that is life\u201d -Picard\n\nToo often DAOs have no explicit plan for how to respond to a hack until one happens. It is at that moment that the culture and values of a DAO are truly defined. Despite this being the frontier there is a theme of good faith efforts from quality projects to do right by their users. Let\u2019s go over the different approaches DAOs have taken when the worst happens.\n\nOne of the more common approaches to reimbursement has been around a long while. Basically the DAO repays those harmed using future revenue. The DAO creates a token, issues it to those affected, and allows them to redeem their IOU as revenue allows. The earliest example of this I\u2019m aware of wasn\u2019t even Defi. Rather it was [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/wp-2019-05.pdf). In 2016 Bitfinex was hacked and lost almost 120k BTC. Rather than simply default, they socialized the loss across their customers balances and issued BFX, a bond token, that was redeemable for $1 for each $1 lost in the hack. They then siphoned exchange fees to a pool that allowed customers to redeem their BFX token. [Harvest](https://medium.com/harvest-finance/announcing-the-grain-claims-portal-20dd12c4f631) in Dec 2020 followed an almost identical approach with the introduction of their GRAIN token. They gave everyone 1 GRAIN per $1 lost in the hack and directed future revenue to a grain buyback market. Then they added liquidity mining on the GRAIN/USDC market. If your protocol has enough revenue to repay the loss in a reasonable timespan and you can get governance token holders to agree to it this is an honest approach that\u2019s a good compromise between user opportunity cost (reimbursed by farming yield) and DAO loss (lost revenue and added issuance).\n\nThe next approach tilts more heavily on the side of DAO loss. Basically, the DAO can repay users from its\u2019 treasury. This is tricky because when a hack happens the governance token price craters. So if the DAO tries to reimburse users with their governance token, that token is at an all time low due to the hack. This leads to both users and the DAO generally getting screwed because the token gets sold far below fair market value. So what is a DAO to do? [Yearn](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1359108691677614080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) had the simplest approach to this. Rather than paying users out in YFI, they took a loan on Maker using their YFI and repaid the $11M loss in DAI. They also explicitly said this was a one-off event and to buy your own insurance next time. [XToken](https://medium.com/xtoken/rxtk-mechanics-272873488346), instead of taking a loan, used a timed release mechanism to give the token time to stabilize before the sell pressure of reimbursement hit. Mechanically, they issued an rXTK token that can be redeemed for more XTK over time the longer you delay claiming (up to a year). It\u2019s a simple workaround to the problem and it\u2019s not as though there was an XTK vault on Maker they could use.\n\nPerhaps the most novel approach I\u2019ve seen is to just, uh, ask nicely for the funds back? When [Alchemix](https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/150-aleth-return-program) had their red carpet exploit, rather than [threatening users](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1443730726751506432) they created an NFT to commemorate good citizens and celebrated their community. Carrot works better than hollow stick as it turns out. If I had to generalize the concept to include black hat scenarios I\u2019d say their approach of offering NFT incentives to fundraise and commemorate helping out in a time of need is a *capital efficient* strategy compared to the alternatives discussed above. Really, it\u2019s amazing how much they got back and how it brought the community together. I personally was an asshole, but at least I feel bad about it.\n\nAll of the above is what you can do if you get hacked without a plan. Surely there must be something you can do proactively, right?\n\nFirst, as a user you may be able to buy insurance. There are platforms that resemble traditional insurance such as Nexus Mutual and Armor, Yam\u2019s Umbrella, Yearn\u2019s Cover, and prediction market approaches using Augur or UMA\u2019s expiring derivatives. Implementation details vary but the basic idea is you buy an \u201cI got hacked\u201d NFT that can be redeemed for money if you indeed got hacked. As with any insurance, they will try to weasel out of it. For example, [Badger](https://badger.com/technical-post-mortem) got hacked recently and users with insurance [didn\u2019t get paid](https://twitter.com/nexusmutual/status/1466395880806928387) because the hack wasn\u2019t on the smart contract but on the frontend. This doesn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence. At the end of the day, some combination of terrible UX, gas-intensive processes, and a lack of user trust is holding back the Defi insurance market.\n\nIn light of that, DAOs have taken to making their own insurance pools ([with blackjack and hookers](https://imgflip.com/i/604s75)). As I mentioned above, DAOs make money. Shocking, I know. Now, they *could* put some of that money in a \u201cbreak in case of hack\u201d piggy-bank but what if the loss is bigger than the piggy-bank? Then they\u2019re stuck in the reactive zone above. Option two is to use the rewards to buy insurance for all their users from an insurance protocol. This is too contractually clunky to work. The amount they have to insure can scale faster than the contract can be amended and there are trust issues regarding payout.\n\nUltimately, what a DAO wants is for the DAO to decide when to cover a loss so it can protect its\u2019 brand and for there to be clear accountability for who is covering that loss in what order (potential for tranches). So, instead of the options above, some DAOs are creating a staking pool of bonded assets that will be used at the DAOs discretion in the event of hack and they take a slice of the protocol revenue and compound the bonded assets with it. The stakers end up making an amplified share of the DAO profits for accepting extra risk and performing an essential service for the DAO. Aave does this with stkAave, XToken does this with xXTKa, and Alchemix is doing this with their v2 launch. These examples use the governance token as the bonded asset which seems to me to be *unwise* but that isn\u2019t required for this scheme to work.\n\nThis system is really a clever inversion of the insurance model as we know it. It insures all users with leverage compared to a reserve pool (kind of like [rented liquidity](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/evolutions-in-liquidity-sourcing/)), cuts the insurance protocol out as a middleman, and effectively makes the DAO the claims assessor which removes the trust problem. If you don\u2019t trust a DAO, don\u2019t use their product. More trusted DAOs will gain market share, which will increase their revenue, which will scale their insurance budget. It\u2019s so much cleaner than a Nexus Mutual design and it\u2019s totally native Defi.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t like about this model is that the bonded assets are usually the governance token. This comes with two problems I\u2019ve alluded to above. The first is the equivalent of congress voting on their own paycheck. The second is that if you think you have $100M in insurance and you get hacked, by the time you can so much as write up a proposal to liquidate some of those bonded assets you probably don't even have $50M.\n\nHere\u2019s some ideas of my own that no one asked for.\n\n* Audits could come with insurance against hacks they didn\u2019t catch.\n* Developers should be able to buy the equivalent of malpractice insurance.\n* Bonded assets that serve as an insurance pool should be of the same type as the potentially lost funds.\n* More protocols should do as Maker and Yearn have done and make a surplus buffer rather than immediately distributing funds as revenue is generated. The full topic of protocol controlled assets (PCA) or protocol owned liquidity (POL) is vast but having an insurance pool is a rather universal suggestion.\n\nIn summary, despite this being the frontier the people here generally want to do the right thing. It\u2019s not just selfishness and brand protection. Literally, the majority of people *want* to do the right thing. The reason we have to obsess over incentive structures and loopholes all day is because not everyone does (evil exists and is relentless) and because these systems are permissionless (we can\u2019t stop bad actors at the door). So, yes, bad things happen in this space. But we\u2019re also figuring out what to do about that. And somehow, I think the good guys are generally going to come out on top.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There\u2019s a warning I give every newcomer to this space in my <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole\">Rabbit Hole</a> speech; this is the frontier.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThere are no guard rails. There is no one you can sue to correct your mistake. There is no one the government can point a gun at to get your money back. There is no FDIC insurance that is going to bail you out. Once you are in custody of your funds, if you fuck something up, it is literally gone forever. Take this seriously.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my few short years in Defi I have personally narrowly dodged half a dozen hacks and been caught in at least two. When a hack does happen I\u2019ll usually track down the technical retrospective just out of morbid curiosity even if I wasn\u2019t affected. I am someone with decades of software background who has audited contracts personally before putting money in. I know enough Solidity to at least have written my own Defi project and to recognize the code origin many projects are forked from. Despite all of that, I have still been caught out more than once. Suffice to say, if I can\u2019t see it coming the majority of investors are hopelessly out of their depth. Seasoned veterans in this space will resonate with this next statement. Even if you do everything right sometimes you can still lose. So, let\u2019s talk a bit about what this ecosystem does <em>when things go wrong</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness\u2014that is life\u201d -Picard</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Too often DAOs have no explicit plan for how to respond to a hack until one happens. It is at that moment that the culture and values of a DAO are truly defined. Despite this being the frontier there is a theme of good faith efforts from quality projects to do right by their users. Let\u2019s go over the different approaches DAOs have taken when the worst happens.</p>\n\n<p>One of the more common approaches to reimbursement has been around a long while. Basically the DAO repays those harmed using future revenue. The DAO creates a token, issues it to those affected, and allows them to redeem their IOU as revenue allows. The earliest example of this I\u2019m aware of wasn\u2019t even Defi. Rather it was <a href=\"https://www.bitfinex.com/wp-2019-05.pdf\">Bitfinex</a>. In 2016 Bitfinex was hacked and lost almost 120k BTC. Rather than simply default, they socialized the loss across their customers balances and issued BFX, a bond token, that was redeemable for $1 for each $1 lost in the hack. They then siphoned exchange fees to a pool that allowed customers to redeem their BFX token. <a href=\"https://medium.com/harvest-finance/announcing-the-grain-claims-portal-20dd12c4f631\">Harvest</a> in Dec 2020 followed an almost identical approach with the introduction of their GRAIN token.

I mean shoot, we are probably talking about 0.5% of the population?\n\nMost people get all of their information about blockchain and crypto from mainstream media, which has no incentive to report on POS yet.
