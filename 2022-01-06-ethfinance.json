That&#39;s a lower low on the weekly going back to Sept 2021. Below $43.7k at January&#39;s close? That&#39;s a lower low on the <em>monthly.</em> Very difficult to come back from that. Sure there&#39;ll be longshot chances to bounce at $39-40k but at that point we&#39;d have bear market <em>structure</em> in place. That&#39;s not the kind of scaffolding we want.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A lot of if&#39;s in here, you&#39;ll notice. We&#39;re on a knife&#39;s edge in all assets. I&#39;ve laid out the cards. I absolutely will start saying &quot;bear market&quot; if these come to pass. It could be a mini bear or a year-long bear. But we&#39;ll need to start looking at bearish structure if nothing changes soon. First would be using tomorrow&#39;s expiry to crawl back above $46k which would represent a modicum of <em>extremely near-term</em> return to bullishness.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-06 00:29:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hrgv0pr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rx78g4","parent_id":"t3_rx78g4","score":52,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/dim-pap","body":"Your thoughts on ETHBTC for 2022?

GME 1.28% is launching a division to develop a marketplace for nonfungible tokens and establish cryptocurrency partnerships, according to people familiar with its plans, pushing the company into much-hyped areas as it tries to turn around its core videogame business.\n\nThe retailer has hired more than 20 people to run the unit, which is building an online hub for buying, selling and trading NFTs of virtual videogame goods such as avatar outfits and weapons, according to the people. The company is asking select game developers and publishers to list NFTs on its marketplace when it launches later this year, the people said.\n\nGameStop also is close to signing partnerships with two crypto companies to share technology and co-invest in the development of games that use blockchain and NFT technology, as well as other NFT-related projects, the people said. The retailer expects to enter into similar agreements with a dozen or more crypto companies and invest tens of millions of dollars in them this year, the people said.\n\nGrapevine, Texas-based GameStop has been working to reset its business after years of losses. The company was at the center of a stock-trading frenzy last year that boosted its share price, which rode a surge in interest and optimism from individual investors.\n\nMany saw potential in GameStop despite the pandemic\u2019s negative impact on foot traffic and even though consumers have been increasingly opting to download and stream games over the internet, rather than buy the kind of hard copies that the company specializes in selling.\n\nLast year, GameStop overhauled its executive team and board of directors, naming activist investor Ryan Cohen as chairman. Mr. Cohen, who co-founded online pet-products retailer Chewy Inc. and sold it for $3.35 billion in 2017, has been pushing to make GameStop more tech-centric.\n\nThe turnaround effort has yet to show significant results in GameStop\u2019s financial performance. In the quarter through October, the company said revenues grew, but its loss widened compared with the same period a year earlier.

GME 1.28% is launching a division to develop a marketplace for nonfungible tokens and establish cryptocurrency partnerships, according to people familiar with its plans, pushing the company into much-hyped areas as it tries to turn around its core videogame business.</p>\n\n<p>The retailer has hired more than 20 people to run the unit, which is building an online hub for buying, selling and trading NFTs of virtual videogame goods such as avatar outfits and weapons, according to the people. The company is asking select game developers and publishers to list NFTs on its marketplace when it launches later this year, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>GameStop also is close to signing partnerships with two crypto companies to share technology and co-invest in the development of games that use blockchain and NFT technology, as well as other NFT-related projects, the people said. The retailer expects to enter into similar agreements with a dozen or more crypto companies and invest tens of millions of dollars in them this year, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop has been working to reset its business after years of losses. The company was at the center of a stock-trading frenzy last year that boosted its share price, which rode a surge in interest and optimism from individual investors.</p>\n\n<p>Many saw potential in GameStop despite the pandemic\u2019s negative impact on foot traffic and even though consumers have been increasingly opting to download and stream games over the internet, rather than buy the kind of hard copies that the company specializes in selling.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, GameStop overhauled its executive team and board of directors, naming activist investor Ryan Cohen as chairman. Mr. Cohen, who co-founded online pet-products retailer Chewy Inc. and sold it for $3.35 billion in 2017, has been pushing to make GameStop more tech-centric.</p>\n\n<p>The turnaround effort has yet to show significant results in GameStop\u2019s financial performance. In the quarter through October, the company said revenues grew, but its loss widened compared with the same period a year earlier. The revenue growth came from sales of hardware and accessories, while revenue from game software slipped 2%.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe believe our emphasis on the long term is positioning us to build what will ultimately become a much larger business,\u201d GameStop Chief Executive Matt Furlong said on an earnings call with analysts last month.

There's obviously more variety, but that's the basic structure.\n\nCEFs sell a bunch of shares in an offering then use the proceeds to buy a set amount of ETH whereas ETFs buy/sell ETH based upon the inflows/outflows to their funds.\n\nQETH is a CEF, ETHX is an ETF. Once you know which kind of fund you're dealing with, you need to understand their market price against their Net Asset Value (NAV).\n\nEssentially, NAV is how much ETH these funds own which can then be used to calculate NAVPU (per unit). NAVPU is how much ETH you get for each share of the fund. So, for example, say a fund has 0.01 ETH Per Unit... at $4k/ETH, NAVPU would be $40.\n\nBut, market forces mean these funds either face inflows (people rushing to buy during a bull-run) or outflows (people reading FUD and selling, or a competing fund lowers their expense ratio, or a shiny new ETF is launched) at any given time. This leads each fund to either trade at a premium (more than NAVPU) or a discount (less than NAVPU). This means, share price is actually be more or less than the actual value of the ETH in the fund.\n\nSo today, QETH's ETHPU is 0.01737560 with would lead to NAVPU of $59.08 @ USD$3400/ETH. It's currently trading at 56.07 for a discount of ~$3, or ~5% from NAVPU. \n\nLong term, IIRC redemption is in June so any discount should theoretically stabilize closer to then. Due to the redemption fee, expect arbitrage to bring the discount around 3-5% IMO. 3iQ also has the ability to buy-back shares & sell ETH when the discount gets too steep (increasing NAVPU), but they haven't done this since last spring (units outstanding has been flat since May), so not really clear on what their plan for that is. \n\nI hope that makes sense.

So, for example, say a fund has 0.01 ETH Per Unit... at $4k/ETH, NAVPU would be $40.</p>\n\n<p>But, market forces mean these funds either face inflows (people rushing to buy during a bull-run) or outflows (people reading FUD and selling, or a competing fund lowers their expense ratio, or a shiny new ETF is launched) at any given time. This leads each fund to either trade at a premium (more than NAVPU) or a discount (less than NAVPU). This means, share price is actually be more or less than the actual value of the ETH in the fund.</p>\n\n<p>So today, QETH&#39;s ETHPU is 0.01737560 with would lead to NAVPU of $59.08 @ USD$3400/ETH. It&#39;s currently trading at 56.07 for a discount of ~$3, or ~5% from NAVPU. </p>\n\n<p>Long term, IIRC redemption is in June so any discount should theoretically stabilize closer to then. Due to the redemption fee, expect arbitrage to bring the discount around 3-5% IMO. 3iQ also has the ability to buy-back shares &amp; sell ETH when the discount gets too steep (increasing NAVPU), but they haven&#39;t done this since last spring (units outstanding has been flat since May), so not really clear on what their plan for that is. </p>\n\n<p>I hope that makes sense. Let me know if you have any other questions about it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-06 09:28:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hrila9s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rx78g4","parent_id":"t1_hrif4e0","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/smilinfool","body":"Amazing answer.

V4 has only been out for about 3 months now, but there aren&#39;t a lot of changes from the earlier versions, mainly it&#39;s been expanded to work on Polygon and Avalanche, and due to the much lower transaction costs there, it has allowed them to spread out the rewards to many more smaller prizes instead of just a handful of large prizes, smoothing out the resulting APR.  The code is open source, audited, and they have a bug bounty program to reward people for finding exploits as well.  Of course the risk is never zero though.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.pooltogether.com/faq/risks\">https://docs.pooltogether.com/faq/risks</a></p>\n\n<p>Remember that since it&#39;s decentralized, you need to pay gas costs every time you claim.  On Polygon and Avalanche at &lt;$1 in gas that&#39;s not a huge deal, you don&#39;t want to do it every day but every few weeks wouldn&#39;t be a problem as it would be a small fraction of the prize value you&#39;re claiming.  If you deposit on the mainnet though, you have &gt;$100 in gas to claim prizes, so you&#39;d need to decide whether it&#39;s worth it on the mainnet and how often you&#39;d claim to keep that from eating into your rewards.

If you get that option, you should be able to put in your Argent zkSync address there and skip steps 4 through 8.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-06 15:42:16","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-01-06 15:46:08","id":"hrka1jw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rx78g4","parent_id":"t1_hrk4o10","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/brecht_","body":"Yeeeeey, succes! thx for the help","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeeeeey, succes! thx for the help</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-06 16:04:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hrkdggt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rx78g4","parent_id":"t1_hrka1jw","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/pseudotheos","body":"Gas is high right now.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Gas is high right now.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-06 14:37:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hrjzu0g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rx78g4","parent_id":"t1_hrjyqgs","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"It ain't alone.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It ain&#39;t alone.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-06 16:02:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hrkd5tn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rx78g4","parent_id":"t1_hrjzu0g","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/crazdave","body":"I think doing it that way you\u2019d need to first bridge the metamask funds onto the zksync wallet https://wallet.zksync.io/account/ (still will cost L1 gas but not as much) and then use that to fund the argent zksync wallet","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think doing it that way you\u2019d need to first bridge the metamask funds onto the zksync wallet <a href=\"https://wallet.zksync.io/account/\">https://wallet.zksync.io/account/</a> (still will cost L1 gas but not as much) and then use that to fund the argent zksync wallet</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-06 15:00:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hrk3lnz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rx78g4","parent_id":"t1_hrjyqgs","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/brecht_","body":"This is What I get when doing This \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MY7W6Ye.jpg","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is What I get when doing This \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/MY7W6Ye.jpg\">https://i.imgur.com/MY7W6Ye.jpg</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-06 15:30:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hrk87ou","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rx78g4","parent_id":"t1_hrk3lnz","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Vinegar_Strokes__","body":"Anybody own land in Sandbox?
