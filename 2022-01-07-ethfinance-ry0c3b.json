I don't consider myself a bear since I still have 75% of my ETH and I'm not short or long, but I am highly suspicious right now, and here's why.\n\n[Here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eWoMgKOH/) is the last 15 years of the S&P 500.  Looks great right?  [Here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uEFsg3NB/) it is with trendlines added.  We've been growing at DOUBLE the historical average rate for the last 2 years, it's unsustainable and it has to end, when it does it's going to be harsh.  Everyone has known that for a while though, it's not news.\n\n[Here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/fVbtFRqO/) is the same chart with resistance lines added, notice anything?  We're in a textbook ascending wedge while ALSO pinned against the long term resistance line dating back 12 years.  Look at what has happened to the market *every single time* we've hit that resistance line.  Also look at how clear and perfect that rising wedge is.  Everything is coming to a head *very soon*.\n\n[Here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/l6ruiKV9/) it is zoomed in on just the last 2 years.  [Here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/GicbM4kd/) is the last 2 months.  If you've been wondering why crypto had a big correction in September, it's right there.  And how it's been crabbing since November, and also the crash a few days ago.  [Here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/scQHNMO2/) it is zoomed out a bit to show where that ascending wedge closes in 2 months.\n\nThe wedge closing doesn't always mean it's going to crash *right then*, sometimes it crabs through the end just a bit, but it still crashes soon after.  I'd guess that the market is going to crash within the next 6 months.  It might not be a full on recession like 2008, but even a year long 30% drop back down to the support line will murder crypto for a good long while.  6 months is still a ways off, there's still time for crypto to sneak in a blowoff top before it happens, but the problem is the global markets are *also* pinned against that 12 year resistance line which is causing them to hiccup every few weeks and crab sideways.  If the global markets hiccup every 2 weeks, and every time they do crypto dips 20%, we're never going to build up the momentum we need for a blowoff top.  Which means we're going to crab mostly sideways, maybe a little up, maybe a little down, until the global markets take a shit this spring and then crypto drops by 75%+.\n\nAll just my opinion of course, but this is why I sold 25% of my ETH and all of my stocks a month ago and moved them to stables, and so far that's looking like a good call.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ll bite.
