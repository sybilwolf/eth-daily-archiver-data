E.g mint your Reddit account as an NFT. This provides an on-chain record of web2 ids to addresses so you can prove ownership of an account using digital signatures. People would also be able to airdrop directly to your wallet using your web2 id as well, saving them from having to collect addresses manually. Obviously it's centralized (trusted notary), but could be fun for some use cases. I've mostly implemented it, but not sure if I'll pull the trigger.\n\nI've spent the past couple weeks really diving in to how this could be implemented in a trust minimized fashion. The crux of the issue is that virtually no web2 platforms sign the data they send back to clients in a way which provides provenance. The only possibility of proving \"I sent query Q to server A (eg. Twitter) and it returned response R (my ID)\" is by leveraging the TLS session in a fancy way. For those that don't know, TLS is the protocol your browser uses to encrypt your connection to websites. When you first connect, your browser does a quick dance with the server to generate a shared session key. Both your browser and the server have this private key and use it to sign and encrypt the data you send to each other. Great! The server *does* sign the data it sends you. But not so fast, you hold the key too, so you could trivially just forge a fake response. Heres where the fanciness comes in.\n\nYou introduce another party into the mix, a notary. Before you and the server do your TLS dance, you first dance with the notary to generate a shared private key using MPC (multi-party computation, in this case 2PC). The important part is that neither you or the notary actually know the full private key because you only have your piece of it and they have theirs. But if you work together, you can encrypt and sign things with it. Now, using the public component of this key, you do the TLS dance with the server and send your query (get my ID) after working with the notary to encrypt it. The server encrypts/signs the response (your ID) and sends it back to you, and because you don't actually know the shared key you have with the server you have no way to forge this response. Bingo, now you can give it to the notary and they know for sure it came from the server. I've simplified this process, but hopefully you get the idea.\n\nCool! Now you can prove to anyone that you have access to private data in ANY server which supports TLS! (Virtually all do). The server didn't have to change anything, it was completely transparent to them. And you didn't have to grant the notary access to the data. That's pretty huge. This technique has, to my surprise, existed for quite some time: [TLSNotary](https://github.com/tlsnotary/pagesigner/) and more recently [DECO](https://www.deco.works/) which has been acquired by...  Chainlink. DECO looks to be the holy grail, it takes it further by mixing in ZK proofs so that you can selectively reveal certain parts of the server response. I'm not informed enough to say for certain, but I think the 2PC could be expanded to (N)PC which would give you a 1 of N trust model! Alternatively you could just re-execute the same query multiple times with different notaries and have them all agree, still 1 of N.\n\nMy mind boggles at the implications of this. Forget Reddit or Twitter, you could connect to a federal website and prove nationality to bootstrap a parallel national voting system. Can only dream about what it could mean for both self-sovereign identity and sybil resistance. My only question is, wen DECO? In the meantime I've been digging deeper into whether I can rub enough neurons together to implement it myself, even if only in a clunky and inefficient way. Will keep at it, but may just be too dumb and will have to wait for the giga brain shadowy super coders to do it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been working on a pet project which allows people to mint their web2 identities on-chain by going through an OAuth flow with a trusted notary.

On paper it makes sense, because certainly many names are worth more than $2k.

I.e., people will be forced to significantly overpay, because they don't know what that next lowest bidder will be willing to spend. Currently, at least the maximum someone would lose over what they would have needed to spend is $2k, if nobody else happened to want the name but they really wanted it. If multiple parties want it at $2k, then it goes to whoever can get the tx in first, which is somewhat annoying, like an NFT mint, but at least also somewhat fair.

Modeled after Olympus's OHM, each FLOOR is intrinsically backed by 0.001\u039e (1 finney), and supports a treasury of yield-generating \"blue chip\" NFT liquidity pairs. FLOOR is minted via rebasing or bonding.\n\nHow does the rebasing mechanism work?\nFLOOR uses an \"intrinsic\" value of 0.001\u039e, (1 finney), made up of a combination of ETH and ETH-denominated blue chip NFTs. When FloorDAO's treasury holds more intrinsic value than the circulating supply of FLOOR, then new FLOOR is minted and distributed to those staking FLOOR (broom, broom).\n\nWhat is PUNK?\nPUNK is an ERC20 token backed by CryptoPunk NFTs in the NFTX vault. The number of circulating PUNK is always equal to (or less than) the number of CryptoPunks in the vault, so 1 PUNK is always backed by at least 1 CryptoPunk. The PUNK vault allows instant selling or buying of CryptoPunk pieces and broadly tracks \"floor\" prices. For more info, see https://nftx.io or https://nftx.wtf\n\nDo I need to own an NFT to participate in bonding?\nNope! FloorDAO bonds primarily use NFTX vault tokens representing NFT liquidity. While you can mint applicable NFTs (like PUNK) into their NFTX vaults for bond liquidity, you can also purchase them directly from DEXes like Sushiswap.\n\nWhen is launch?\nEarly Q1 2022.\n\nIs there a whitelist?\nThere is no whitelist.\n\nWhat are the tokenomics?\nWe will be releasing tokenomics details very soon.\n\nIs FloorDAO supported by Olympus?\nNot yet, but we are working on it!\n\n___________\n\nThey also have a [medium article](https://floordao.medium.com/?p=bbee448f0fa0) explaining the basics of their nft liquidity plan.
