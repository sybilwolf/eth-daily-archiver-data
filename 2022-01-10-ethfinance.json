I've been extremely dormant on here the last several months, but still enjoy reading the daily on a semi-regular basis. It's been great to see how active and engaged the community is, from both old faces and new, and hopefully I can carve out some more time to contribute here in 2022. \n\nBut let's talk about the present. So, most of us here survived the harrowing 60% dip from $4,400 to $1,700 last summer (among probably dozens of other dips), but this current dip somehow feels *way* worse, because we believed this bull market would rhyme better with the last cycle and we would already be at $10k by now. Right?  \n\nWell, we were wrong about that. There will be no January blow-off top, no doot ETH to 10K...yet. This cycle (if we still believe crypto is cyclical) is already shaping out to be longer and perhaps a smidge more mature than the previous one. (But certainly no less volatile!) I don't believe we've entered a prolonged bear market, but I'm also a person who thought the same thing back in the spring of 2018. However, I do think there's a lot more evidence to support my feelings this time around compared to back then.\n\nThese a few thing I do know:\n\n1. There has been no blow-off top and yet ETH hasn't been this oversold (both on the daily **and** weekly timeframes) since the COVID crash of February/March 2020. It's even approaching a 15-month low on the monthly timeframe: \n\n [Monthly](https://imgur.com/TqlWC9F) \n\n [Weekly](https://imgur.com/mSOlIZm) \n\n [Daily](https://imgur.com/hynjq8V) \n\n Buying ETH around this $3,000 level right now is a no-brainer, IMHO - **if you believe the bull isn't finished yet.** The price has been so juicy these last couple weeks that I added to my stack on the way down at $3,400. \n\n Did I catch the bottom? Absolutely not. Will I regret buying that ETH six months from now? Two years from now? Six years from now? Almost certainly not. \n\n I remember buying a few ETH at $800 back in 2018 as it was falling from an ATH of $1,400. It promptly continued to slowly bleed to $80 and stay well under $800 for two years. I felt foolish about that purchase for quite some time. I don't feel foolish about it in the slightest now. (I also heavily DCA in late 2018/2019, which certainly helped.)\n\n2. I'm no financial guru, but it seems to me that investing is not about being perfect or even about chasing perfection. It's not about selling *every single* top and buying *every single* bottom - that's simply an unrealistic expectation to put on yourself. I think it's more about buying a quality asset that you have a high level of conviction and interest in and then having enough patience and discipline to see the market catch up to its real value.\n\n And ETH today is just still so damn undervalued, on just about every single metric you can possibly measure. Whether you're looking at the [annual revenue](https://twitter.com/CryptoGucci/status/1478752901321441286) and the [price-to-sales ratio](https://cryptofees.info/), the [exchange reserves](https://cryptoquant.com/asset/eth/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=linear&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=line), the [burn rate](https://watchtheburn.com/), the [number of active addresses](https://cryptoquant.com/asset/eth/chart/addresses/active-addresses?window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=linear&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=line), the amount of [ETH staked in the beacon chain](https://cryptoquant.com/asset/eth/chart/eth2/total-value-staked?window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=linear&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=line), the [transaction counts](https://ethtps.info/), including L2s (h/t u/mister_eth), the amount still [locked in DeFi](https://defipulse.com/), the [widespread adoption of ENS](https://ethleaderboard.xyz/), the [earth-shattering explosion of NFTs into the mainstream culture](https://dune.xyz/rchen8/opensea), and on and on.  \n\n And that's without even touching upon the fact that the market hasn't truly started to price in [The Merge](https://ethmerge.com/) aka The Cliffening/Triple Halvening (h/t /u/insidethesimulation) or any of the other hugely consequential and beneficial improvements on the [Ethereum protocol development roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402). \n\n\n3. ETH (and digital assets in general) are in a multi-year (read: multi-decade) bull run. Since the first Ethereum block was mined back in 2015, it's been up and to the right for ETH the asset. The ETH bulls have been winning and will continue to win, in the long-term. I think the only serious questions one has to ask themselves is how much conviction and patience they have with Ethereum. If the answer to those two is 1. A lot and 2. A lot, then the dips don't really hurt as much...hell, many times you're even thankful for them.  \n\nTo sum everything up: Crypto is trial by fire, there are no free lunches (reminder: using leverage will eventually kill you), and the path to $10k+ is paved with many more dipperinos. But try to enjoy the ride every day, even on the red days. \n\nAlso, I know making money is cool, but the tech is actually fucking amazing too :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hello fellow ethfinanciers, hope everyone is doing okay in this new year. I&#39;ve been extremely dormant on here the last several months, but still enjoy reading the daily on a semi-regular basis. It&#39;s been great to see how active and engaged the community is, from both old faces and new, and hopefully I can carve out some more time to contribute here in 2022. </p>\n\n<p>But let&#39;s talk about the present. So, most of us here survived the harrowing 60% dip from $4,400 to $1,700 last summer (among probably dozens of other dips), but this current dip somehow feels <em>way</em> worse, because we believed this bull market would rhyme better with the last cycle and we would already be at $10k by now. Right?  </p>\n\n<p>Well, we were wrong about that. There will be no January blow-off top, no doot ETH to 10K...yet. This cycle (if we still believe crypto is cyclical) is already shaping out to be longer and perhaps a smidge more mature than the previous one. (But certainly no less volatile!) I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve entered a prolonged bear market, but I&#39;m also a person who thought the same thing back in the spring of 2018. However, I do think there&#39;s a lot more evidence to support my feelings this time around compared to back then.</p>\n\n<p>These a few thing I do know:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There has been no blow-off top and yet ETH hasn&#39;t been this oversold (both on the daily <strong>and</strong> weekly timeframes) since the COVID crash of February/March 2020. It&#39;s even approaching a 15-month low on the monthly timeframe: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/TqlWC9F\">Monthly</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/mSOlIZm\">Weekly</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/hynjq8V\">Daily</a> </p>\n\n<p>Buying ETH around this $3,000 level right now is a no-brainer, IMHO - <strong>if you believe the bull isn&#39;t finished yet.</strong> The price has been so juicy these last couple weeks that I added to my stack on the way down at $3,400. </p>\n\n<p>Did I catch the bottom? Absolutely not. Will I regret buying that ETH six months from now? Two years from now? Six years from now? Almost certainly not. </p>\n\n<p>I remember buying a few ETH at $800 back in 2018 as it was falling from an ATH of $1,400. It promptly continued to slowly bleed to $80 and stay well under $800 for two years. I felt foolish about that purchase for quite some time. I don&#39;t feel foolish about it in the slightest now. (I also heavily DCA in late 2018/2019, which certainly helped.)</p></li>\n<li><p>I&#39;m no financial guru, but it seems to me that investing is not about being perfect or even about chasing perfection. It&#39;s not about selling <em>every single</em> top and buying <em>every single</em> bottom - that&#39;s simply an unrealistic expectation to put on yourself. I think it&#39;s more about buying a quality asset that you have a high level of conviction and interest in and then having enough patience and discipline to see the market catch up to its real value.</p>\n\n<p>And ETH today is just still so damn undervalued, on just about every single metric you can possibly measure.
