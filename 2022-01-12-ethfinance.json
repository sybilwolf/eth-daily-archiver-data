There's a lot here I only partially understood but there were a few good quotable sections that piqued my interest.\n\n> You can go build your own project or you can come merge with us, we can seed you with $100M in PCV, you inherit our social capital, you get access to our development teams, you get access to our auditors. Soon you're going to have to make a case for why you wouldn't join the FEI team. There's also this other side to it. Let's say you're going to go build your own protocol. There's a future where the tribe can fork you, seed it with $100M dollars, and outcompete you. Who are people going to use? A protocol where you get cheaper rates and $100M are already there or a protocol that one guy has just shipped himself. There's going to be a network effect in joining the tribe.\n\nThere's also a section earlier on their Turbo platform that I need to look into more.\n\n> This is our first joint venture. The idea behind Turbo is its an evolution on the MakerDAO model of a stablecoin. In MakerDAO the supplier and borrower are the same person... What if we split up the supplier and the borrower into 2 different entities like on Compound but instead of using a money market you have a synthetic issuance like FEI. So it combines Fuse + MakerDAO + FEI. It's a strict improvement on the existing model in almost every way. Our target market is DAOs like for Fuse and FEI. Let's say the Uniswap DAO wants to create a liquid lending market for UNI. They would collateralize a FEI loan through Turbo and they would pay 0% interest but they have to put that FEI back into another Fuse pool. It's a two step process. The generation side is done by the DAO and it doesn't cost them anything. Then they put the FEI back into a Fuse pool and that Fuse pool has a market driven interest rate that has whatever assets they want in it. It could have Unisocks, UNI, Fei, other stablecoins, etc but they are going to have this base layer of FEI liquidity that was generated by the Uniswap DAO for their users to go lever up on UNI or get capital efficiency on Unisocks or whatever.\n\nMost of this makes sense to me. Obviously this presupposes there is an AMM with sufficient depth to liquidate the FEI if the token price falls. So if I made a bunch of LogrisTheBard LTB tokens I can't just go mint a bunch of FEI with it. The advantage to DAOs over Compound is a 0% interest rate so they are only accepting price risk on their treasury asset. Does this threaten the FEI currency in some way though? What happens if the FEI peg is lost again? I need to read [this](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/introducing-fei-protocol-2db79bd7a82b) again and reflect on it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m just catching up on this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zco37eTWN2w\">TribeDAO merger</a> Bankless video.

The generation side is done by the DAO and it doesn&#39;t cost them anything. Then they put the FEI back into a Fuse pool and that Fuse pool has a market driven interest rate that has whatever assets they want in it. It could have Unisocks, UNI, Fei, other stablecoins, etc but they are going to have this base layer of FEI liquidity that was generated by the Uniswap DAO for their users to go lever up on UNI or get capital efficiency on Unisocks or whatever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most of this makes sense to me. Obviously this presupposes there is an AMM with sufficient depth to liquidate the FEI if the token price falls. So if I made a bunch of LogrisTheBard LTB tokens I can&#39;t just go mint a bunch of FEI with it. The advantage to DAOs over Compound is a 0% interest rate so they are only accepting price risk on their treasury asset. Does this threaten the FEI currency in some way though? What happens if the FEI peg is lost again? I need to read <a href=\"https://medium.com/fei-protocol/introducing-fei-protocol-2db79bd7a82b\">this</a> again and reflect on it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-12 10:23:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hsdnyrg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_s1yxv0","parent_id":"t3_s1yxv0","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TeamRedundancyTeam","body":"Second half of the first part is sketchy as fuck though right, that's not just me?
