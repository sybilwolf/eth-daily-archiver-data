This first update is going to be quite massive, but I trimmed it down in size to not clog up the daily. You can find the full post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/s34n6j/starknet_update_1/?).\n\n**General protocol news & discussions**\n\n- [a new version of the HardHat plugin was just released](https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-hardhat-plugin/67/10), containing improvements and support for new features for devs.\n\n- there was a good discussion about [how one can verify transaction data](https://community.starknet.io/t/accounting-on-starknet-for-dexes/316/10) because a validity rollup only publishes state differences (and abstracts away large parts of other data) - people will be able to do this by running a L2 full node and querying a command that will be implemented in the next Alpha version.\n\n- next StarkNet Alpha version to release next week!\n\n- what to expect from the next version? tune in to the next community call on [January 18th](https://community.starknet.io/t/community-calls-list-schedule-call-for-speakers/331) to find out \ud83d\udc40 there's also a schedule for all future community calls in there!\n\n- there are already several threads with intricate dev questions & answers up on [Starknet Shamans](https://community.starknet.io/), which you can think of as a mix between a community forum & ethresear.ch.\n\n**The biggest discussion so far has been around, you guessed it: fees. Specifically, how will fees work on StarkNet?**\n\nFees on a rollup are comprised of four different components: \n\n1. The amount of data sent to L1 (frequently referred to as call data)\n2. Cost of computation (which is done by provers)\n3. Storage cost (read/write operations)\n4. L2 network transmission cost \n\nFees will be estimated when a user makes a transaction request, similarly to Ethereum mainnet. Fees are paid in ETH, but fee abstraction is on the roadmap - to allow you to pay with any token (but reminder: sequencers always need ETH to pay for L1 settlement!). Currently, all fees are subsidized by StarkWare until the fee mechanism is implemented. There is also a slight markup on fees to account for L1 gas fluctuations (most rollups have this, just recently Optimism reduced their markup). In the future, in a decentralized StarkNet, other methods such as fee auctions and/or other concepts that are still being researched may be implemented. In other words: the design space is very flexible. If you want to chime in, [check out the discussion on it!](https://community.starknet.io/t/fees-in-starknet-alpha/286)\n\nThere were two more great discussions around the [issue of reverted transactions](https://community.starknet.io/t/management-of-reverted-transactions-in-starknet/136), and [time to finality for rollup transactions.](https://community.starknet.io/t/how-long-will-finality-take-on-mainnet/72/2) For more details, read the full post I linked above!\n\n#Ecosystem updates\n\n- [Here's a list of all publicly known projects](https://starkware.notion.site/Projects-Building-on-StarkNet-a33dee55778a4515a9be9bdae02ee682) building on StarkNet. That includes DeFi, gaming, NFTs, etc. Healthy mix of everything! Rest assured that much more is in the pipeline.\n\n- Want to learn Cairo? [There's a new tutorial](https://github.com/l-henri/starknet-cairo-101) that focuses on *reading* code, not writing it. Doesn't require you to install any software!\n\n- DopeWars, an upcoming game on StarkNet, recently released a [roadmap update](https://dope-wars.notion.site/DopeDAO-Update-Jan-12-2022-5b71873d32da4407affc955baba6ffbb).\n\n- Briqs, a minecraft-like NFT game, launched in alpha and you can actually test it right now by using the Argent X wallet that can be found [here.](https://www.argent.xyz/blog/argent-x-starknet/) After that, follow [these steps](https://twitter.com/briqs_/status/1481265499031973894).\n\n- [Here](https://twitter.com/odin_free/status/1479470476606980101) is a massive thread summarizing everything you can currently do on StarkNet/StarkEx, highly recommend checking it out!\n\n- There's a community effort to port AAVE v3 to Starknet [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploying-aave-on-starknet/6726).\n\n#Dates and events\n\n- next community call: January 18th\n- next dev call: end of January, TBD\n- [First ever StarkNet hackathon](https://starknet.io/starknet-hackathon-amsterdam/): April 25-26, Amsterdam\n- StarkNet summit: TBD, had to be postponed due to COVID\n\n**Workshops**\n\n- [Paris NFT](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/paris-nft-workshop-tickets-244440557287): Jan 21st\n- more online workshops on the way!\n\nThank you for reading, see you on the next (hopefully smaller!) update!

This is an ecosystem that will grow in size for a long time, so I guess one thing that confuses me about the singularity is that if a new protocol, XYZ DAO, enters the space and wants to use Tokemak, then wouldn't that end the singularity if it was previously achieved? Tokemak wouldn't have XYZ as part of their PCA, so they'd either have to sell some PCA to buy XYZ or turn emissions back on to fund XYZ reactors till they gain enough in fees to turn it off again.\n\nI'll take a crack at answering those questions:\n\n>Once the singularity is reached, what would the yield be on TOKE? My understanding is 0. All the trading revenue is absorbed as PCA.\n\nI think this is correct, TOKE would basically be a speculative asset at this point. It's value would be derived from the fact that it is used to direct the liquidity to pairs / AMMs. I guess you could almost say it's \"backed\" by it's PCA due to the value of controlling that pool of resources. It's not like the marketcap couldn't dip below the value of the PCA, but I think it would be sort of comparable to OHM and its reserve. I actually don't know if that is a good comparison, but I think there's got to be a way to correlate value to the PCA. Additionally, TOKE is the governance token for Tokemak and that does add value the more it becomes a DeFi lego.\n\n>Once the singularity is reached, what is the yield for LPs? Clearly 0 right?\n\nI'm trying to find info on this and from the twitter threads and write-ups I've read that are linked in their discord, it does seem that it would go to 0 because the LPs are no longer needed. The protocol would control so many assets that it would provide PCA and ABC assets. In my initial reading I thought the protocol would only cover PCA, not ABC, but if TOKE is no longer being emitted, there would be no incentive for LPs providing ABC so it must cover that too. That seems crazy though. My knowledge on how this plays out is shallow, but I just don't see their ability to pull in ABC/PCA from liquidity fees outpacing every DAO's demand for liquidity. I think I need to look into this scenario more, but I do find it more likely they'll have to keep emitting TOKE.\n\n>Does the TOKE contract have a maximum supply or can more be issued as voted on by the DAO?\n\nTechnically, according to the docs it is set at 100mm (Edit: I'm actually not sure if this is true, the docs say the emissions can go on for longer than anticipated but idk if that means they can take longer to get to 100mm or if they can surpass 100mm if necessary), but if the singularity never happens, then the protocols ability to function would essentially collapse. If there's no incentive to provide liquidity then they wouldn't be able to provide their main purpose which is \"Liquidity as a Service\". Unless the PCA is so massive that they can sell some unutilized assets and buy new in-demand assets. I just don't see it being that much of a blackhole though.\n\nEither way, I have to imagine there's a way to move to a new contract, so if the DAO votes to increase supply they'd be able to accomplish that. Didn't Olympus have to shift to a new contract for V2? My understanding of smart contracts and how they change/upgrade is pretty limited so if you have insights here, I'd love to hear them.\n\nEdit: I just looked at their docs again and they state that the Admin role \"can expand the boundaries of the system. It can add more pools, tokens, and exchanges. Given that power, the only one that will be assigned to that role is our DAO multisig\". So looks like a shift away from hardcap should be possible.\n\nOverall though, this makes me think that Tokemak should maybe chase a minimum viable issuance instead of setting a hard cap. Build the PCA to generate as much of their own liquidity as possible which would allow them to reduce TOKE issuance as much as possible.\n\nThanks, Logris! This has certainly given me a lot to think about.
