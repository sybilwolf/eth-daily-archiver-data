How does it address this challenge?\nCG: Visa\u2019s CBDC Payments Module is designed to provide an on-ramp for CBDC to existing payment networks, so that CBDC networks can easily connect to traditional financial service providers.  For banks and issuers processors, they\u2019ll be able to plug into the module and integrate their existing infrastructure and be enabled to do things like issue CBDC-linked payment cards or wallet credentials for consumers to use. We\u2019re in the process of integrating our module with the ConsenSys Codefi CBDC sandbox powered by ConsenSys Quorum, so that our platform can be ready to tap into enterprise blockchain technology.\n\nSA: That\u2019s right. ConsenSys Quorum is an open-source version of the Ethereum protocol that\u2019s optimized for enterprise applications. It can enable a two-tier CBDC system for central banks to issue and distribute CBDC. Quorum\u2019s robust open-source protocol layer ensures compatibility with private permissioned and Ethereum Mainnet networks as well as familiar products and tooling in the Ethereum ecosystem.

How does it address this challenge?\nCG: Visa\u2019s CBDC Payments Module is designed to provide an on-ramp for CBDC to existing payment networks, so that CBDC networks can easily connect to traditional financial service providers.  For banks and issuers processors, they\u2019ll be able to plug into the module and integrate their existing infrastructure and be enabled to do things like issue CBDC-linked payment cards or wallet credentials for consumers to use. We\u2019re in the process of integrating our module with the ConsenSys Codefi CBDC sandbox powered by ConsenSys Quorum, so that our platform can be ready to tap into enterprise blockchain technology.</p>\n\n<p>SA: That\u2019s right.
