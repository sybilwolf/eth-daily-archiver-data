This was partially due to continued improvements to the Scooper order batching program, but was more due to the current maximum throughput parameters of the Cardano blockchain. While this is likely to negatively impact the user experience, the congestion is a sign of the Cardano network operating as intended by gradually applying backpressure. This created natural queues so that the Cardano network could absorb this load without crashing or decreasing the security of the ledger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See, when it&#39;s on Cardano, congestion is &quot;intended backpressure&quot;, creating beautiful natural queues.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the course of this 40-minute load test, a single SundaeSwap Scooper performed 139 scoops (i.e., transactions which aggregate many user operations), which is approximately 3 scoops a minute. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow, crazy throughput. It&#39;s good that the Cardano devs took their time to do it right, instead of rushing it like Ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>On a more serious note, I know they can theoretically crank up some parameters regarding blocksize. The fact that they haven&#39;t done so yet, hints at the system currently not being quite as capable as they want you to believe. The blog posts promises some protocol updates later this year, so let&#39;s see where they end up.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-16 06:32:34","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-01-16 06:45:52","id":"hswj722","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_s55358","parent_id":"t1_hswavj5","score":30,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"Increasing block size won't help them, whole thing is a mess because of terrible design choices which can't accommodate smart contract usage.

Options underwriting is interesting but I'm not sure how much you can scale the use of your treasury for that. Collateralized loans are interesting but they depend on liquidity much deeper than the loan so it will always be a small portion of the treasury.
