Estimated calculation concerns and how we could meaningfully track consensus of these percentages aside, we frankly cannot allow anything to delay the Merge (to ensure I'm not misunderstanding what everyone means by that word, I mean the end of Proof of Work, and full deployment of blocks being sent by the Beacon Chain).\n\nWe have NFTs publicly derided in every niche when their use is suggested, due to climate concerns. These are valid (if not potentially also strawman when you consider TradFi/Internet energy usage), but yet projects are still launching all day every day and being bought up. We need PoS (and, thus, the Merge) to end these comments and to allow NFTs to thrive (including any future mortgage deeds, ID/Proof of Humanity).\n\nSimilarly, we NEED the Merge to remove one of the biggest stumbling blocks to CBDCs coming online. Do you think any democratic nation is going to allow a digital version of their currency to be fully deployed onto any chain that is still involving Proof of Work, and an indefinite wait time to PoS? The optics would be terrible.\n\nWould all the competitor PoS chains we know and love accept an infinite delay without trolling? Of course they wouldn't. We need to get this out of the door and start ending the \"ETH development is always delayed years longer than they predict\" narrative they've gained.\n\nOK, so if we accept the above points, we can't delay the Merge a day longer than we have to.

That means that you have permission to claim at any point after they enable the smart contract to do so.  You have dominion over the asset from the moment the claimdrop contract is enabled, and at that moment, ENS was worth $0, as u/bosticetudis said, so that's your cost basis, and also the taxable income. Claiming it later is clearly exercising that dominion *that you already had.*\n\nFor a counterexample, look at Eth staking income - you do *not* have dominion over it, and won't until a hardfork enables withdrawals. So no taxes until that moment (but in that case, Eth already has a price, so there will be hefty income tax for every solo staker when withdrawals are enabled.) I know some people are arguing that they're receiving the income now, before they have dominion over the asset, and it's my understanding that that's a 'more conservative' and also valid way to look at it, but it's also extremely clearly not under their dominion yet, and therefore not actually taxable.\n\nThere's the added dimension of 'what if I didn't *want* the airdrop or claimdrop (or didn't know about it)?' Nobody should be able to force you to pay taxes involuntarily. I think that one's pretty commonsense. If you don't want an airdrop, just never touch it and don't acknowledge that it belongs to you (like we all do with those scam airdrops filling our wallets...) If you don't want a claimdrop, simply don't claim it.

Claiming it later is clearly exercising that dominion <em>that you already had.</em></p>\n\n<p>For a counterexample, look at Eth staking income - you do <em>not</em> have dominion over it, and won&#39;t until a hardfork enables withdrawals. So no taxes until that moment (but in that case, Eth already has a price, so there will be hefty income tax for every solo staker when withdrawals are enabled.) I know some people are arguing that they&#39;re receiving the income now, before they have dominion over the asset, and it&#39;s my understanding that that&#39;s a &#39;more conservative&#39; and also valid way to look at it, but it&#39;s also extremely clearly not under their dominion yet, and therefore not actually taxable.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s the added dimension of &#39;what if I didn&#39;t <em>want</em> the airdrop or claimdrop (or didn&#39;t know about it)?&#39; Nobody should be able to force you to pay taxes involuntarily. I think that one&#39;s pretty commonsense. If you don&#39;t want an airdrop, just never touch it and don&#39;t acknowledge that it belongs to you (like we all do with those scam airdrops filling our wallets...) If you don&#39;t want a claimdrop, simply don&#39;t claim it. And then obviously you have to stick with that choice forever, since if you later did sell that drop, your taxes would retroactively be incorrect because apparently you did choose to receive the drop after all.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-17 10:28:50","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-01-17 10:42:32","id":"ht2h8db","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_s5wm13","parent_id":"t1_ht1pbf8","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/offthewall1066","body":"Point taken that to many (and me in my post) airdrop now means \u201cclaimdrop\u201d.

Dfinity is targeting the cloudserver space and if everything goes by plan, ETH nodes could run on the ICP instead of AWS servers, which is often criticized as a failure point with regards to more decentralization.\nPersonally, I see Dfinity and Ethereum as complementary and not as direct competition.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-17 08:44:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ht20o6d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_s5wm13","parent_id":"t1_ht1q82k","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"This is very interesting.
