For eg the \"floor\" in the last cycle was around $80-100 for eth. Which means we are 35x up from there. Even if the price \"crashes\" to 1k, that's a 10x increase (1000% increase) in eth floor price, phenomenal numbers for any asset class. Add to that the fact that under PoW, the network is issuing about 15,000 eth a day, which means at current prices we need buyers of ~$1,500 million *every month*. In a bull market that supply would be sapped up fast. But if everyone's spooked by the macro, $1.5 bil of monthly dumping can wreck the price action. \n\nMy main point however isn't that I'm worried about the price action per se...I do think long term we should easily breach aths and go past five figures for eth. But the hypothetical scenario of the merge being delayed plus the current macro environment would, in my opinion, elicit a very predictable and bad reaction price wise over a prolonged period of time, because of the confluence of two nasty narratives (eth development always delayed, and macro bull market ending as the feds tighten monetary policy to control inflation going into the mid terms).

For eg the &quot;floor&quot; in the last cycle was around $80-100 for eth. Which means we are 35x up from there. Even if the price &quot;crashes&quot; to 1k, that&#39;s a 10x increase (1000% increase) in eth floor price, phenomenal numbers for any asset class. Add to that the fact that under PoW, the network is issuing about 15,000 eth a day, which means at current prices we need buyers of ~$1,500 million <em>every month</em>.

Why would I learn a bunch of random symbols just to say a couple of words? </p>\n\n<p>- &quot;Yes, for a couple of words to a person close to you  this does not make a lot of sense, but imagine if we wanted to say a lot of things to a faraway tribe or remember something unchanged for a long time. </p>\n\n<p>- &quot;Well I have pretty good memory. I can remember things well by myself. And when we talk to other tribes, some person would still have to deliver these symbols. Why couldn&#39;t this guy just remember the message? And how many different symbols would I need to learn anyways?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>- &quot;It is about 30 symbols&quot;</p>\n\n<p>- &quot;Wow, no one is ever going to learn and remember 30 different symbols just to scratch them on some stone for others to see. That is crazy. And also, just speaking is so much more efficient. How fast can you &quot;write&quot; a word? What - 5 seconds, 10? I can speak a whole story in the same time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>- &quot;Yes, as I said, this new technology is not strictly better in every situation, but can&#39;t you see the advantages? Say some people wanted to spread a message fast to many other people. They could just copy the message and spread it forward. And the message would remain unchanged. Not dependent on people&#39;s memories and interpretation.  And the messenger does now not even have to be a person now. I could even see animals used as messengers in the future - like birds.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Birds? You are delusional man. We have a perfectly good communication system now - it is called speaking. Why did you have to go and reinvent the wheel? Why would you want us hunched over all day making these symbols wasting our time that we could spend hunting. That is just wasteful. Stop it with this nonsense and go light a fire for the night. &quot;</p>\n\n<p>-- <em>A real dialogue from a long time ago, probably.</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-19 13:25:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"htdeh2h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_s7j59d","parent_id":"t3_s7j59d","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/InsideTheSimulation","body":"Fast forward to the era of Maxis:\n\n\u201cLatin is perfect and every other language is a shitlang.\u201d","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Fast forward to the era of Maxis:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLatin is perfect and every other language is a shitlang.\u201d</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-19 13:30:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"htdfcqb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_s7j59d","parent_id":"t1_htdeh2h","score":25,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Whovillage","body":"Yes, and the infamous scroll-size wars.
