Truth be told, majority of people working in crypto have no fucking clue either because they don\u2019t read ethfinance. They are all searching for an eth killer but having no luck finding one. It is crazy how dependent all crypto exchanges are on ethereum. It would be suicidal for them to switch gears.. anyways, for all the young folks in here, this Reddit is pure alpha and stay strong during a downturn. Use rocketpool or self stake to earn some yield and wait a year or two for the world to wake up on the full power of ethereum.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-21 07:31:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"htlx7fx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_s93u0a","parent_id":"t3_s93u0a","score":50,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stablecoin","body":"Power law taking effect in r/ethfinance, that's for sure. \n\nI notice too watching some youtube channels that cover all coins/ecosystems, and the traders on Twitter, and the rotators who think they will always be early but never stick around to build on anything...Nobody inside of crypto has any clue about the merge or upgrade or how Eth is already successfully scaling.
