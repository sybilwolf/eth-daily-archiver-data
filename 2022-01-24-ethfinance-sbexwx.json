I love that you have made this process of obtaining passive income from Ether easy for me.\n\nHowever, I am concerned that you may be using the Ethereum consensus client Prysm for running your validators and consensus nodes. Prysm is currently a supermajority client, with roughly 2/3 of the total Beacon Chain validators running it. This is very problematic for several reasons, and as a customer of yours, if you are using Prysm I would like to ask you to please switch to a minority client such as Teku, Nimbus, or Lighthouse, or at the very least an even distribution of the available clients. Ideally, no single client would have more than 33% of the total stake. If you are using Prysm, I will not be staking further Ether with you until you resolve this issue.\n\nTo be clear, if you are using a majority Ethereum consensus client like Prysm, it puts my funds, and the stability of the Beacon Chain, and of Ethereum as a whole, at risk. If problems were to emerge with that client's implementation, at best the inactivity leak from a majority of all validators experiencing the same downtime would lead to a loss of staking rewards for me and all of your staking clients. Worse, it could lead to mass slashing and heavy loss of our funds. And worst of all, it could lead to major consensus failures and chain splits on Ethereum, which would be bad if it were to happen now, and catastrophic to the entire crypto ecosystem (the source of all of your profits as a staking service provider and crypto exchange) if it were to happen after the Merge.\n\nFor more information, please see this page:\u00a0[https://upgrading-ethereum.info/altair/part2/incentives/diversity](https://upgrading-ethereum.info/altair/part2/incentives/diversitySo)\n\nAs your staking customer, if you are using Prysm I strongly urge you to switch to a minority client for your staking services, and will not be staking further Ether with you until you can confirm to me that you are not using Prysm.\n\nThank you very much,\n\n<Your name>","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For anyone staking ETH on Coinbase or other large hosting service, it&#39;s important that you reach out to customer service about the fact that\u00a0Prysm continues to\u00a0dominate the beacon chain\u00a0with approximately 68% of all validators running their software.

I have no real reason for this assumption other than more baseless speculation coupled with the fact that the supply obviously can't deflate forever. You're forcing me to think!\n\n[This ethresearch thread](https://ethresear.ch/t/circulating-supply-equilibrium-for-ethereum-and-minimum-viable-issuance-during-the-proof-of-stake-era/10954/3) has a lot of math, including a response to the \"is there even an equilibrium?\" question in the response. But i'm too tired to understand all that math\n\n>there is a demand for the asset having the least inflation among all assets\n\nI don't think the market really cares about the supply inflation of assets as much as it cares about risk and fiat-denominated yields. In that regards the market should find an equilibrium where \"eth-denominated staking yield + ether appreciation in USD = worth the loss of liquidity + inherent risks associated with staking\".\n\nLiquid staking protocols bring down the illiquidity factor (but bring their own extra risks too) but in the end staking should converge to a sweet spot where the market determined the staking yield and it's all priced correctly. On the other side of the equation, the burn is dependent mainly on the demand for blockspace, which is independant of the staking yield.

I have no real reason for this assumption other than more baseless speculation coupled with the fact that the supply obviously can&#39;t deflate forever. You&#39;re forcing me to think!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/circulating-supply-equilibrium-for-ethereum-and-minimum-viable-issuance-during-the-proof-of-stake-era/10954/3\">This ethresearch thread</a> has a lot of math, including a response to the &quot;is there even an equilibrium?&quot; question in the response. But i&#39;m too tired to understand all that math</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>there is a demand for the asset having the least inflation among all assets</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think the market really cares about the supply inflation of assets as much as it cares about risk and fiat-denominated yields. In that regards the market should find an equilibrium where &quot;eth-denominated staking yield + ether appreciation in USD = worth the loss of liquidity + inherent risks associated with staking&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Liquid staking protocols bring down the illiquidity factor (but bring their own extra risks too) but in the end staking should converge to a sweet spot where the market determined the staking yield and it&#39;s all priced correctly. On the other side of the equation, the burn is dependent mainly on the demand for blockspace, which is independant of the staking yield. If there&#39;s too much burn, then ETH will appreciate and the same amount of USD revenue will burn less ETH, and vice versa.

Luckily for us, crypto was a bit more measured. I know the jump back to 2450 seems scary but it's actually more bullish than if we ripped back above 2800 before daily close. I'd be worried if we do that these next hours.\n\nLast thing is the IWM (small caps). It's tracked our sentiment as closely as QQQ tracks our movement. IWM is often the canary for stocks. Topped on Nov 8 just like us. Dropped into a correction long before the indices. And it had a banner day today. So why am I less worried about its rip? Because it's been in the corrective phase for three months, a common time period for equities to correct. And it spooled out an impressive green engulfing daily candle on massive volume. That's bottom signal territory. It does have farther to fall, though, if we get something crazy hawkish out of the Fed on Wednesday and traders wanna punish.\n\nCrypto:\n\nWe are turning back upward on daily momentum, using the Stoch RSI. There aren't many false positives [when BTC breaks back above 20 and it's just above at 21](https://www.tradingview.com/x/p1sRTpvv/) as I type this. That suggests a chance at relief. It's also crazy oversold on the daily RSI.\n\nBut the weekly has plenty more downside. And even after today's action on great volume... it's still just a doji / spinning top on the daily -- a decision candle. That decision can be made down. A close above $36.6k or better $36,825 to escape the weekend highs would be a little better.\n\nAnd ultimately, friends, you can't ignore something as giant as this. [The monthly chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BkPQRQz7/) isn't something you speculate on or fuck with. I think we'll have bounces and rallies. I think we'll have heartbreaking drops. Rips and dips. But overall, barring a miracle before January 31 it looks like winter is here. I do think it's a shorter one we're looking at. The stock market, if it really plummets, tends to take about four months to bottom out. We could come out of this in late Q2/Q3 quite strongly.\n\nVolatility:\n\n[VIX on the daily is in position to get crushed.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/b2RPXtae/) If we can get it below 24, it should end the correction. It doesn't respond as well to geometric analysis though. They closed the gap in the 30s today, but there is still that wild COVID gap up at 45. It's looking better but it CAN mathematically go back up in a scary rip.\n\nAnother one that doesn't respond well to geometric TA is [BTC shorts.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6akk7fWP/) They're high, but not as high as they've been. There's plenty more room to the downside if whales want to exit on our liquidatious asses. Yet it's also pretty toppy on the momentum so it looks stable in the very near-term.\n\nI don't have any answers. It certainly feels like a bounce is due on Wednesday, as certainty regardless of the nature tends to have green markets. Remember, markets find news to justify their movement; they don't react to it, even when it seems like it. That also means if the Street wants more blood, they can also do THAT regardless of Fed rate decisions. Head on a swivel.\n\nOn a longer scale, the downtrend is still very intact and very strong, especially with that weekly and monthly chart. As soon as momentum flips there, we'll follow it.\n\nCheers, all!\n\nedit: aaaaaaaand we're back. for a potential sneak preview of tomorrow, watch as the S&P futures deal with the pivot point at 4388. keeping in mind, futures volume is fake and bullshitty and you should never trade *solely* off of it.\n\nedit 2: please stop golding me. very kind, but it makes me uncomfortable.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Okay okay, there&#39;s a lot to look at so expect a scuntload of edits.</p>\n\n<p>Stocks:</p>\n\n<p>What an unholy deluge of red the morning was.</p>\n\n<p>Just using the SPY as proxy for QQQ and DIA since they had similar movements.

While the bear sucked, it got me to invest far more than I ever would have without it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-24 07:00:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hu0x24y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sbexwx","parent_id":"t1_hu0vegd","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stablecoin","body":">That happened to me.\n\nI read that and briefly thought you had a brain tumor discovered after getting hit by a car!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>That happened to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I read that and briefly thought you had a brain tumor discovered after getting hit by a car!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-24 07:08:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hu0y6yl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sbexwx","parent_id":"t1_hu0x24y","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/TheHighFlyer","body":"Life is just what you make out of it.
