If anything they have a strong hatred towards it. If you log onto Twitter, check any news story on crypto and the top comments are nothing but &quot;crypto is a scam.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>A friend of mine who&#39;s pretty shrewd, owns a couple million-dollar businesses and had his share of early crypto gains, told me, &quot;I had a 60 year old client ask me how to buy Bitcoin this year.

Market collapsed about two months later and here we are. </p>\n\n<p>People are just not getting interested in it beyond a &quot;get rich&quot; investment. They really aren&#39;t interested in the complexity and the usages; to them its either a way to make money, or just another complicated pain in the ass thing to worry about in an overly complicated world. </p>\n\n<p>I think it won&#39;t be long before we see it settle back into a niche market, as much as our fanbase here doesn&#39;t want to hear that.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-25 10:22:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hu4xtd8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sc6ozb","parent_id":"t1_hu4vfld","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/believeinapathy","body":"Could have said the same about the internet in 1996 when only 30 million used it and had barely anything to do on it for a normal joe and you had to use DOS.

There simply isn&#39;t enough scale or privacy on public infra like ethereum to make web3 better than web2 for sharing content with one another, and having social hubs like these to congregate in are simply too valuable to quit outright.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately zero knowledge proofs solves both privacy and scale. We&#39;ll switch when we can have the best of all worlds--keep our data private/share only what we would like, but still store that data on public/decentralized infrastructure that is not controlled by any single big corporation. </p>\n\n<p>*edit to add--Admittedly there&#39;s also still an issue of how the UX will work for social media in web3. Even when fees are <em>virtually</em> nothing I&#39;m not sure <em>everyone</em> will be willing to pay vs accept an ad model for &quot;free&quot; use of a platform (although I think a lot of crypto natives might). ZKProofs can&#39;t address that part for the masses, but I have fairly high confidence that problem can be figured out too.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-25 20:20:17","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-01-25 20:32:05","id":"hu75yw1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sc6ozb","parent_id":"t1_hu72auc","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/newtosh","body":"There are good decentralized social media platforms out there, we just choose to ignore them because *no blockchain*.
