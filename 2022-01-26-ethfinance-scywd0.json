It could make it awkward in market contracts and create a perverse incentive for market makers to \"rent\" NFTs to stakers to keep them active while preserving their value. (2) client development - if a new client is developed, there has to be some method by which developers can issue a new NFT that's permissionless enough that anyone can develop a new client, but also not *so permissionless* that someone can fork a client without changing the code, call it a new client, and generate a bunch of new NFTs to sell.\n\nIn any case, I believe this is a really productive topic for discussion, and I'm enjoying talking about it with you.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Are people staking right now because they hate Ethereum?

If one day all of the Nimbus clients go down but also this Prysm client that was reporting/signing as Nimbus, that would be embarrassing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the blockchain and even on Reddit, I and many others are pseudonymous. If validators required KYC, then this point would be more valid in my eyes.</p>\n\n<p>If I do something dishonest on the blockchain, is anybody really ever going to know?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes if a solution is left wanting for a long enough time it&#39;s ok to start thinking about hacks.

It could make it awkward in market contracts and create a perverse incentive for market makers to &quot;rent&quot; NFTs to stakers to keep them active while preserving their value. (2) client development - if a new client is developed, there has to be some method by which developers can issue a new NFT that&#39;s permissionless enough that anyone can develop a new client, but also not <em>so permissionless</em> that someone can fork a client without changing the code, call it a new client, and generate a bunch of new NFTs to sell.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I believe this is a really productive topic for discussion, and I&#39;m enjoying talking about it with you.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-27 08:52:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hugjht3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_scywd0","parent_id":"t1_hug6z8g","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"> If I found an activity I could do that greatly benefits me while marginally harming the network, I would do it in a second, sorry everyone.\n\nIs the disparity between the clients actually that great?

In other words, the issue is that harsh financial incentives are tied to a low probability future event which makes people get complacent, and there's no great way to shift that model towards lesser financial incentives tied to high-probability imminent events.\n\nYou can see a similar issue in criminal justice theory - paradoxically, the best way to disincentivize crime is not to increase the penalties but to increase the chances someone will get caught.
