They need to hear from you that you value client diversity! \n\n/u/interweaver was kind enough to write out a message that you can just copy, paste, and modify in a few places. I have pasted it below, please reach out to customer service today! I would guess that a single large staking service enacting change in their staking policies could fix the issue both through moving their ETH but also by the example they would set to other staking services.\n\n\n**Dear <staking services provider>,**\n\nI am currently staking <X> Ether with your service. I love that you have made this process of obtaining passive income from Ether easy for me.\n\nHowever, I am concerned that you may be using the Ethereum consensus client Prysm for running your validators and consensus nodes. Prysm is currently a supermajority client, with roughly 2/3 of the total Beacon Chain validators running it. This is very problematic for several reasons, and as a customer of yours, if you are using Prysm I would like to ask you to please switch to a minority client such as Teku, Nimbus, or Lighthouse, or at the very least an even distribution of the available clients. Ideally, no single client would have more than 33% of the total stake. If you are using Prysm, I will not be staking further Ether with you until you resolve this issue, and may leave your service when staked Ether can be moved.\n\nTo be clear, if you are using a majority Ethereum consensus client like Prysm, it puts my funds, and the stability of the Beacon Chain, and of Ethereum as a whole, at risk. If problems were to emerge with that client's implementation, at best the inactivity leak from a majority of all validators experiencing the same downtime would lead to a loss of staking rewards for me and all of your staking clients. Worse, it could lead to mass slashing and heavy loss of our funds. And worst of all, it could lead to major consensus failures and chain splits on Ethereum, which would be bad if it were to happen now, and catastrophic to the entire crypto ecosystem (the source of all of your profits as a staking service provider and crypto exchange) if it were to happen after the Merge.\n\nFor more information, please see this page: https://upgrading-ethereum.info/altair/part2/incentives/diversity\n\nAs your staking customer, if you are using Prysm I strongly urge you to switch to a minority client for your staking services, and will not be staking further Ether with you until you can confirm to me that you are not using Prysm.\nThank you very much,\n<Your name>","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For anyone staking ETH on Coinbase or other large hosting service, it&#39;s important that you reach out to customer service about the fact that Prysm continues to dominate the beacon chain with approximately 68% of all validators running their software.
