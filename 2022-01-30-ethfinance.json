The proof of funds also includes information concerning the origin of your crypto-assets which have been used for fiat withdrawals on Bitpanda.\n\nEven though this may sound complicated, all you actually have to do is prove how you acquired the funds that you used not only for your recent deposit or withdrawal, but also the sum of your previous transactions, i.e. all previous transactions up to the stated amount.\n\nFor example, we can accept the following documents to prove the origin of cryptocurrency funds:\n\n* Cryptocurrencies purchased on other brokers and other exchanges\n   * Screenshots of purchase and withdrawal confirmation displaying your account ID and all transaction details\n   * Confirmation emails which provide proof of purchase or withdrawal Receipts which provide proof of purchase (e.g. using an OTC)\n   * Trading profits which have been made on other brokers or exchanges\n   * Screenshots of the transaction history displaying profits Transaction history displaying withdrawals to Bitpanda\n   * Screenshots of the exchange account displaying your account details\n   * Name of the exchange\n* Income from services (e.g. affiliate income or other services)\n   * Detailed description of the service\n   * Receipts for services which have been paid for in cryptocurrencies\n   * Names, addresses, contact details and information about the companies involved, as well as their legal form and VAT ID number\n   * Cryptocurrency addresses of the sender and the recipient Transaction IDs (hash)\n   * The amount sent, displayed in both cryptocurrency and fiat Date of the transaction\n   * Bank statements displaying both receipts and transactions\n   * A screenshot of your account displaying that you are an affiliate\n   * Screenshots of your wallets, which show their current income\n   * Screenshots of your transaction history and withdrawal history\n   * Explanations of the origin of the cryptocurrencies used for the payment transactions\n* Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and token sales\n   * If you purchased coins through a token sale, please submit a copy of the contract confirming payment made in cryptocurrency\n   * In the case of an ICO, the full name of the ICO and the associated project\u2019s website must be visible. We also need to know the exact amount invested in the cryptocurrency and the equivalent value in fiat at the time of the investment\n   * In addition, we need the transaction history that documents the purchase and withdrawal of the token (wallet addresses and transaction ID)\n   * Bank statement, if a fiat currency was used for investing\n   * Confirmation emails, which display the purchase\n* Mining\n   * Receipts for the purchase of mining hardware, on which the address of the buyer (the name that you have registered on Bitpanda) and seller are displayed.
