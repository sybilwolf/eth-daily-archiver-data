I did listen to it some days ago, but haven't found the time to write down my thoughts, so I might miss things etc. but please feel free to correct or fill in the blanks. \n\nFirst of all Michael Saylor is crazy, but tbh he's not as crazy as I thought. Still I think he is the kind of person that made me skip podcasts until 2020, because he **loves** talking and he also loves hearing himself explain the world. These are the people that killed podcasts for me in the beginning. There were like 5 questions in total and he kept on talking for 2 hours. \n\nBut as I said, he is not as crazy as I thought since I believe his thesis is at least \"ok\". Bitcoin as a hedge for inflation is obviously nothing new, but his thoughts are clear and based on experience (from Argentina), not just some some hearsay which I think makes everything less crazy. I also think his thesis re: \"(investment) adoption\" makes sense. One big fund/ nation state buys and kicks off big fund \"fomo\" is a realistic scenario imo. So I wouldn't be unhappy if that played out like that in 2022. I don't think we have disconnected yet from BTC, so if we want to move up again (in the short term) we should be okay with BTC investments from high profile institutions. \n\nThere are still some things which I think were strange/ unexpected/ wrong. \n\n\\- His \"derivatives\" thesis: in the context of L2 discussions (to move BTC faster) he basically says that there are so many L2s and derivatives already - and basically makes Binance a bitcoin scalability solution. Now that might be true, but it obviously is completely centralized and MS said during his Argentina rumble that this is of course a problem (he couldn't move funds out of the country because of a centralized entity not allowing him). That was really odd. \n\nOn top I think there is a huge problem here: If e.g. trading bitcoin miner stock (\"derivative\") is like investing in Bitcoin (which again might be okay) then BTC has a problem down the road. Because if much of the BTC investments are made via derivatives and Binance (or whatever centralized exchange there is) then of course the security of BTC at one point is a problem, even if BTC trades at 10x of what it trades today - no on-chain trades = no security budget. I don't know if he's not aware (he talked about BTC being there in 10k years), but I guess he is, he's just not discussing it. \n\n\\- The Manhattan metaphor: Ok, cool, BTC is Manhattan, I can work with that. Uniquely positioned, can be defended etc. Now I don't know about US history, was there a different port / city before New York that was the center of the \"new world\" in the beginning but later \"replaced\" with NY? If we look at history, that is def the case. So many empires that had their capital, but at one point the empire fell and so did the capital (or at least it lost influence). \n\nOn top he never really answered the question by Ledger about the value added by the business that is on top of New York. He avoided that answer / couldn't really answer it. He just said \"BTC is the rock\", which is kind of true, but not true as well. It's a rock like it is gold. And of course it is great that NY is safe because the foundation is strong. But the value of NY is not purely based on that, but because of the network built on top of that rock. (And as know liberosist already stated that they agree that BTC is actually one of two networks that could be the foundation for everything in crypto). \n\n\\- His longterm thesis/ thinking: This is connected to the Manhattan metaphor. He basically says \"BTC hasn't changed for 10 years, ETH keeps changing every year and the clock restarts with every fork\". He also says \"BTC is here to stay 10k years\". Now that basically means we are at 0,1% of the lifetime of BTC, 10 years is nothing. Or in other words this 10 year advantage is \"nothing\" in the grand scheme of things\". Or in other words: even though ETH could be fully developed in the next 10 years, then start the 10 year clock and then take BTCs place. Sounds like a long time, 20 years - but is nothing if we think about a 10.000 year period. \n\nNow I guess Saylor would argue that especially in these 20 years BTC will build the network effects to position itself as the only store of value and that is an okay. But it's still not as strong as he makes it since he positions BTC as something that has no competition. \n\nI think he thinks a flippening is impossible. I would love to hear his thesis if the flippening happened and what that would do to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Saylor is crazy, but not that crazy. Good thesis, I would think this could play out like he states and BTC is still a good investment imo. Still very one-sided arguments downplaying any threats / competition.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some thoughts on the Michael Saylor appearance on UpOnly. I did listen to it some days ago, but haven&#39;t found the time to write down my thoughts, so I might miss things etc. but please feel free to correct or fill in the blanks. </p>\n\n<p>First of all Michael Saylor is crazy, but tbh he&#39;s not as crazy as I thought. Still I think he is the kind of person that made me skip podcasts until 2020, because he <strong>loves</strong> talking and he also loves hearing himself explain the world. These are the people that killed podcasts for me in the beginning. There were like 5 questions in total and he kept on talking for 2 hours. </p>\n\n<p>But as I said, he is not as crazy as I thought since I believe his thesis is at least &quot;ok&quot;. Bitcoin as a hedge for inflation is obviously nothing new, but his thoughts are clear and based on experience (from Argentina), not just some some hearsay which I think makes everything less crazy. I also think his thesis re: &quot;(investment) adoption&quot; makes sense. One big fund/ nation state buys and kicks off big fund &quot;fomo&quot; is a realistic scenario imo. So I wouldn&#39;t be unhappy if that played out like that in 2022. I don&#39;t think we have disconnected yet from BTC, so if we want to move up again (in the short term) we should be okay with BTC investments from high profile institutions. </p>\n\n<p>There are still some things which I think were strange/ unexpected/ wrong. </p>\n\n<p>- His &quot;derivatives&quot; thesis: in the context of L2 discussions (to move BTC faster) he basically says that there are so many L2s and derivatives already - and basically makes Binance a bitcoin scalability solution. Now that might be true, but it obviously is completely centralized and MS said during his Argentina rumble that this is of course a problem (he couldn&#39;t move funds out of the country because of a centralized entity not allowing him). That was really odd. </p>\n\n<p>On top I think there is a huge problem here: If e.g. trading bitcoin miner stock (&quot;derivative&quot;) is like investing in Bitcoin (which again might be okay) then BTC has a problem down the road. Because if much of the BTC investments are made via derivatives and Binance (or whatever centralized exchange there is) then of course the security of BTC at one point is a problem, even if BTC trades at 10x of what it trades today - no on-chain trades = no security budget. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s not aware (he talked about BTC being there in 10k years), but I guess he is, he&#39;s just not discussing it. </p>\n\n<p>- The Manhattan metaphor: Ok, cool, BTC is Manhattan, I can work with that. Uniquely positioned, can be defended etc. Now I don&#39;t know about US history, was there a different port / city before New York that was the center of the &quot;new world&quot; in the beginning but later &quot;replaced&quot; with NY? If we look at history, that is def the case. So many empires that had their capital, but at one point the empire fell and so did the capital (or at least it lost influence). </p>\n\n<p>On top he never really answered the question by Ledger about the value added by the business that is on top of New York. He avoided that answer / couldn&#39;t really answer it. He just said &quot;BTC is the rock&quot;, which is kind of true, but not true as well. It&#39;s a rock like it is gold. And of course it is great that NY is safe because the foundation is strong. But the value of NY is not purely based on that, but because of the network built on top of that rock. (And as know liberosist already stated that they agree that BTC is actually one of two networks that could be the foundation for everything in crypto). </p>\n\n<p>- His longterm thesis/ thinking: This is connected to the Manhattan metaphor. He basically says &quot;BTC hasn&#39;t changed for 10 years, ETH keeps changing every year and the clock restarts with every fork&quot;. He also says &quot;BTC is here to stay 10k years&quot;. Now that basically means we are at 0,1% of the lifetime of BTC, 10 years is nothing. Or in other words this 10 year advantage is &quot;nothing&quot; in the grand scheme of things&quot;. Or in other words: even though ETH could be fully developed in the next 10 years, then start the 10 year clock and then take BTCs place. Sounds like a long time, 20 years - but is nothing if we think about a 10.000 year period. </p>\n\n<p>Now I guess Saylor would argue that especially in these 20 years BTC will build the network effects to position itself as the only store of value and that is an okay. But it&#39;s still not as strong as he makes it since he positions BTC as something that has no competition. </p>\n\n<p>I think he thinks a flippening is impossible. I would love to hear his thesis if the flippening happened and what that would do to. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr: Saylor is crazy, but not that crazy. Good thesis, I would think this could play out like he states and BTC is still a good investment imo. Still very one-sided arguments downplaying any threats / competition.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-31 00:05:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"huywxkh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sgtyj0","parent_id":"t3_sgtyj0","score":40,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-31 02:33:14","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-07 07:33:49","id":"huz7x9k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sgtyj0","parent_id":"t1_huywxkh","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"Yes, very valid take, both from an investment point of view, but also regarding MS personally.

The meat industry is not sustainable yet people continue to create a market for it. There's a whole lot of hypocrisy already with people saying they love animals but through the power of cognitive dissonance they eat meat anyway.  And now they don't want to \"destroy the planet\"\n\nWhatever though.  I'm a hypocrite too, i just try to be aware of it and I'm not going to stand around and take moral high ground.  I think that's what is bothering me is that this whole \"don't want to destroy the planet\" is really just an empty platitude for many people and is more just virtue signaling \"hey look at me I'm so cool and relevant and i care about the environment, never mind i eat meat with every meal, drive a hummer, and don't know how to recycle to save my life\"\n\nThe other thing is then saying that crypo has no value.  It's ok to eat meat, for example, because it has value. There's a sensory fulfillment-- the whole experience feels good.  So it's ok to destroy the planet because it's food and \"necessary\". Crypto on the other hand has no value to them so it doesn't need to use all this power.  They don't care or get what we're trying to build here is more than a bunch of shitty pieces of randomized digital art.

The meat industry is not sustainable yet people continue to create a market for it. There&#39;s a whole lot of hypocrisy already with people saying they love animals but through the power of cognitive dissonance they eat meat anyway.  And now they don&#39;t want to &quot;destroy the planet&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Whatever though.  I&#39;m a hypocrite too, i just try to be aware of it and I&#39;m not going to stand around and take moral high ground.  I think that&#39;s what is bothering me is that this whole &quot;don&#39;t want to destroy the planet&quot; is really just an empty platitude for many people and is more just virtue signaling &quot;hey look at me I&#39;m so cool and relevant and i care about the environment, never mind i eat meat with every meal, drive a hummer, and don&#39;t know how to recycle to save my life&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The other thing is then saying that crypo has no value.  It&#39;s ok to eat meat, for example, because it has value. There&#39;s a sensory fulfillment-- the whole experience feels good.  So it&#39;s ok to destroy the planet because it&#39;s food and &quot;necessary&quot;. Crypto on the other hand has no value to them so it doesn&#39;t need to use all this power.

Besides the apparent multiple mentions of a random DOT OHM fork it seemed mostly factual/not a shill per se, but it's definitely taking an incredibly rosy view of the project. OHM is effectively in the final stages of transitioning from a pure Ponzi to a \"hedge fund\" model, but this video (and other current holders/buyers) like to describe that as \"having used high APY to attract capital and attention\". Sure, it attracted capital and attention, at massive cost to those who bought at the 10x+ treasury backing value and at massive benefit to those who got in at the beginning and sold near that top.\n\nThe current iteration of OHM is pretty much making the entire \"APY\" concept redundant by using gOHM, since gOHM is just as fungible and continues to \"appreciate\" OHM at whatever arbitrary APY. That means the supply of OHM will continue to go to ~infinity, but this is irrelevant except for any poor souls who happen to miss this fact and fail to stake. So now gOHM represents a constant percentage of OHM's treasury. The video does correctly point out that OHM has significant revenues, but those are pretty much all from semi-safe stablecoin yield plays (and various less-safe LPs). That makes gOHM a yield-bearing asset in some sense (although note that there's literally no mechanism for returning treasury value to gOHM holders so long as OHM's price stays above $1). A yield bearing asset can reasonably trade at some price somewhat above its direct cash backing, which is the basis for (real world, not OHM) bond valuations. However there's not really anything OHM's doing that's particularly special for their income generation, so you could just as easily take your capital and do your own LP strategies without using OHM at all. As mentioned in the video, they might be able to continue to pump their yields beyond what the average person could by having an \"integrated NFT marketplace\" or just taking on more and more risk by buying up token supply of new projects at lower-than-market prices (acting as a VC in some sense). This is just a form of regulatory arbitrage however, completely abandoning the whole \"reserve asset\" fiction to act as a VC fund that non-certified investors can buy into.\n\nAll of this is to say, yes the treasury means there's some real value, yes they can continue to increasing backing by yield on the treasury assets, but make no mistake, that treasury was gathered through heavily obfuscated theft.

Here's why:\n\n1. Its FDV is $4.7 billion. This is kind of high-ish, but not really super high - there are many projects out there with much higher FDV. It'll take 2 years to get to FDV.\n2. It has a reasonable chance of competing, at some level, with OpenSea. The platform has a few unique features that people like, it's cheaper to use for NFT traders than OpenSea, and it shares 100% of fee revenue with LOOKS stakers. It seems a cut above other recent attempts at creating \"decentralised OpenSea\" alternatives.\n3. The current APY on staking LOOKS is excellent - both in the native token and in ETH (which is where this gets really interesting - see point 6).\n4. If you stake and forget now, you will likely double or triple your LOOKS over 2022 alone.\n5. Staked LOOKS auto-compound which is convenient and saves gas fees.\n6. The fact that stakers also earn ETH is incredible for what it does to the APY and the longer term value prop. Let's say you're bullish ETH, and only neutral LOOKS. If you buy some LOOKS with stable coins and stake your LOOKS for long enough (at this point it may only take 3 months) - then you will earn that $ investment back in the ETH rewards alone. But we said that we're bullish on ETH, so perhaps by then ETH has doubled as well. That's quite the deal when it doesn't even take into account the LOOKS rewards.\n7. The involvement of ETH means that even if/when the LOOKS token goes down in value, its APY can remain very high - or go higher in $$ terms - because you're earning ETH with it.\n8. If the platform succeeds and gets serious market share, then it would remain very lucrative on the ETH rewards even once the LOOKS rewards run out (which will take 2 years, so there is quite some runway left there too).\n9. With all of the above, I see there being almost no risk of losing your initial investment. (I bought with stablecoins rather than ETH as I don't want to put any ETH in. But when spending stables to purchase, the APY paid in LOOKS + ETH - when I am bullish ETH - is too good to pass up).\n\nRisks:\n\n1. There is currently a lot of wash trading. This is because wash trading is currently profitable with the LOOKS trading rewards and NFT whales are loving it. This will change at some point (possibly in 10 days) and it'll be interesting to see how much organic volume the platform can keep and generate after that.\n2. The team is anon, but seems very engaged / responsive / professional / proficient.\n3. It's on mainnet so gas costs are not tiny.\n4. On Feb 10, the LOOKS rewards halve. They halve again 90 days after that. People are waiting to see whether the lower rewards reduce wash trading and also cause a sell-off on LOOKS at that time, as the ETH trading fee rewards may come down as wash trading comes down.\n\nDYOR!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In the spirit of this fantastic place, I&#39;d like to say a few words about $LOOKS - not trying to shill the project - DYOR, etc. Disclaimer: I have a small bag.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s currently a super low-risk buy.

But when spending stables to purchase, the APY paid in LOOKS + ETH - when I am bullish ETH - is too good to pass up).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Risks:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is currently a lot of wash trading. This is because wash trading is currently profitable with the LOOKS trading rewards and NFT whales are loving it. This will change at some point (possibly in 10 days) and it&#39;ll be interesting to see how much organic volume the platform can keep and generate after that.</li>\n<li>The team is anon, but seems very engaged / responsive / professional / proficient.</li>\n<li>It&#39;s on mainnet so gas costs are not tiny.</li>\n<li>On Feb 10, the LOOKS rewards halve. They halve again 90 days after that. People are waiting to see whether the lower rewards reduce wash trading and also cause a sell-off on LOOKS at that time, as the ETH trading fee rewards may come down as wash trading comes down.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>DYOR!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-31 15:14:03","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-01-31 15:18:04","id":"hv25wpx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sgtyj0","parent_id":"t3_sgtyj0","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sm3gh34d","body":"Kudos on a solid write-up.
