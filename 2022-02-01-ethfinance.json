It&#39;s just a waiting game with a little bit of trend frontrunning to make extra profit and remain entertained while this unfolds.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-01 13:41:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hv6trr2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_shnot0","parent_id":"t1_hv6pmlx","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stablecoin","body":"Only a matter of when, not if.
