Note, the post-market on FB's miss did close back below at 452.65.

Back above the 21 Day EMA in a hanging man test, but not yet above the 370 range of its breakdown candle. Post market closed 360.18 way *below* the 362 breakdown candle bottom and almost eclipsing yesterday's stab low. Cause for caution, but not concern, as it digests the Meta news.\n* IWM (201.34) - canary zero. Not just running out of steam, but failing to break out above the 205 zone where both the 21D EMA and breakdown candle top are. And the failure was a big engulfing red candle day with a post-market close on Meta news (Meta... data? haha) even below prior daily tops. Not a good place to roll over again if it does.\n* DIA (356.03) - Canary alpha. We never talk Dow, and she's just such a bright light of hope today so I had to. Easily the strongest index heading into 2022, she's back above both the 21D *and* the 50D MAs, undoing the nasty winter drop entirely. Post market was steady at just 355.91. Major diapers! For as rough as small caps look and as uncertain as SPY/QQQ seem today at close, the market WILL NOT CRASH while the Dow Jones is still up. So if it also rolls over, then sure, we can shore up. But this is a nice bulwark.\n* BTC closed the daily and began its rollover on the Stoch RSI way too prematurely, as it needs 40.8k to break the downtrend. The game continues until the Stoch crosses below 20, so there's still time. Not great, though, as BTC got hard rejected on average volume at the exact halfway point of the Jan 21 bear flag pole  and the 21D EMA. It did close below the highs of the prior EIGHT days of candles so the next level at $36.7k is pretty key. And it absolutely CANNOT go back below $35k, or we get another leg down likely to the $29k region.\n* ETH is doing so well on the ratio... which is unfortunately when grandpa tends to shit his pants and ruin our fun. ETH also had an engulfing red daily yesterday, closing below the prior 2690 open. But it was nowhere in the same league as BTC's weakness. We're also starting to prematurely roll over on the Stoch; we needed $3000 minimum or $3400 to break the downtrend. I wouldn't worry yet as we can hold above it a lot better on ratio strength. The first sign would be a few closes below 2595, then 2540, then 2485.\n\nCheers!\n\nedit: Amazon earnings post-market today! They've been in a scary zone of uncertainty so buckle up.

That market is salivating for rETH collateral.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rocket Pool will probably never onboard investors or institutions oflarge enough size to kickstart hundreds of thousands of minipools.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can you explain why you think this is the case? Some of them don&#39;t want to just get &quot;exposure to staked ETH&quot;, some of them need to stake on behalf of their clients for multiple years without requiring high liquidity. Running nodes provide a better return than holding rETH by itself without compounding risks in DeFi.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll like to see what you mean by &quot;rETH liquidity&quot; too - I do think it&#39;ll be challenging to create a deep enough pool for rETH for purposes of liquidation/unstaking/staking. As the protocol grows, the best choice (deposit pool size) can be expanded. More ways to expand rETH/ETH liquidity are being explored too -&gt; IL-free provision via Bancor amongst other options.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-02 01:06:05","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-02-02 01:11:03","id":"hv96l1d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sih4qe","parent_id":"t1_hv93jeo","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/JustMyTwoSatoshis","body":"There will also be one or more clone projects soon enough that pull away some users from rocketpool.\n\nI love the project, but all these reasons are why I hold ETH and not ETH tokens.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There will also be one or more clone projects soon enough that pull away some users from rocketpool.</p>\n\n<p>I love the project, but all these reasons are why I hold ETH and not ETH tokens.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-02 08:48:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hvao265","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sih4qe","parent_id":"t1_hv93jeo","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/mellowmango1","body":"Lido and stakewise are definitely working on trustless decentralized staking pools for anyone to join.

I would argue this - I am a photographer and I take a black and white photo of Niagra Falls. If I then sell that photo for $20 to you, you have ownership of that photo. It doesn't imply that you now own Niagra Falls... the same way you buying Jack Dorsey's tweet screenshot doesn't imply you own anything other than that jpeg.\n* So this may come back to bite me as a \"Bob, you are an idiot moment\", but can't one argue that each copy of a jpeg is unique as well? My understanding is jpegs degrade with each copy. Each jpeg has unique 'virtual' brushstokes if you will. So admittedly my painting versus printing off a copy was kinda weak, but maybe to tweak that you hire a professional painter to copy it. The 99% are unable to tell with the naked eye. Is that not a similar thing? What if we invent a computer that can 100% replicate a painting down the brush stroke?\n   * Maybe a counterfit Pokemon card would of been a better example... Is a 1st edition Charizard from 'the factory' more meaningful than a convincing knock off? Of course, because part of the value is knowing it is real. In terms of the game setting it functions the same way, but there is human value tied to it being a first edition.\n* The third party web server is a fair critique. although for my purposes my intent was to discuss 'legit' NFTs if you will.
