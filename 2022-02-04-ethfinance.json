This absolutely is the number one issue. As a relatively new protocol its always going to be hard to get going, but this should change with organic growth over time. Liquidity is required for the big boys and it\u2019s also required for dApp integrations. Poor liquidity leads to bad UX and so deters dApps. Argent wallet have stated this (also a bit of blurred lines as Lido were a launch partner). There\u2019s also a 2,000 ETH limit in the deposit pool. This makes it difficult for large treasuries and individuals to allocate. If you had 10k ETH you would need multiple transactions and to wait for the deposit pool to be depleted each time. This is a barrier to entry. But the hope is that with organic growth it will get to the required thresholds; once there is enough liquidity we will see the integrations. rETH, like stETH, will become a desired form of collateral for DeFi degens. Why, if you\u2019re willing to accept the smart contract risk, would you not use an ETH derivative that appreciates against ETH over time for all your needs? Also worth noting that Curve have said they would prefer to integrate a rebalancing token.\n\nNode Operator bottleneck. Right now this is not an issue and in fact the reverse is true. Many NO are waiting for higher commissions to spin up more minipoools, but the comission is dependent on deposits to the deposit pool. So there\u2019s plenty of people currently on the sidelines. Long term however, this flips and definitely becomes and issue. Once a lot of capital gets locked up, where is the new capital coming from? If rETH becomes popular then it will start maxing out the deposit pool and be dependent on NO\u2019s to increase supply. But two things to bear in mind. Firstly staking APR is going to double after the merge. This is going to lead to a staking boom. DeFi degens chasing yield will be incentivised to stake as it will give a good ROI. This will bring an influx of NO. Secondly, after withdrawals are enabled, I envisage a lot of solo stakers making the transition over. People have already alluded to this, but in a post merge world where MEV and tips dominate, as a solo staked the odds are against you. Not only can you run twice as many validators, but RocketPool will have a smoothing pool, which means a more standardised APR (as opposed to a lottery in proposing a high fee block).\n\nSmart contract risk. Despite all the audits, it\u2019s still a new protocol and so some people would rather wait until it\u2019s battle tested. This may be 3 months, it may be 12. But once it\u2019s proven to be reliable, this will attract more NOs and more rETH buyers.\n\nCEX listings. I\u2019m not sure why the would. It would get confusing. Rather, they may change their approach at the backend, and it may actually be CEXs spinning up minipools. Why? APR. APR will dominate and if an exchange does nothing then their proposition becomes less attractive. If they start farming RPL rewards too, the APR increases. More people use their service. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what the status quo is, they will need to remain competitive.\n\nSome more things to consider;\n\nL2 adoption. Currently buying rETH is generally expensive. But with greater L2 adoption from retail, it will become a quick and easy way to start staking. We may even see people move from exchanges once they enable direct withdrawals (APY - exchanges won\u2019t be able to react as quickly initially and *hopefully* people understand better the merits of decentralisation and client diversity).\n\nDevs and leadership. I\u2019ve only recently joined Rocket Pools Discord and I\u2019m very impressed by the discussions going on. It\u2019s a good sign when you feel like the dumbest person in the room. They have a lot of things planned to help grow Rocket Pool, including just basic marketing. Everybody loves a meme.\n\nUnbonded minipools and DVT. At some point in the future it will be possibly to own any amount of RPL and start a minipool with others. This will be huge for adoption and you get more NO\u2019s again.\n\nI mean there\u2019s plenty more, but the one thing needed at the moment is time.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As always it\u2019s complicated.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly to address some of the comments:</p>\n\n<p>Liquidity.

Also worth noting that Curve have said they would prefer to integrate a rebalancing token.</p>\n\n<p>Node Operator bottleneck. Right now this is not an issue and in fact the reverse is true. Many NO are waiting for higher commissions to spin up more minipoools, but the comission is dependent on deposits to the deposit pool. So there\u2019s plenty of people currently on the sidelines. Long term however, this flips and definitely becomes and issue. Once a lot of capital gets locked up, where is the new capital coming from? If rETH becomes popular then it will start maxing out the deposit pool and be dependent on NO\u2019s to increase supply. But two things to bear in mind. Firstly staking APR is going to double after the merge. This is going to lead to a staking boom. DeFi degens chasing yield will be incentivised to stake as it will give a good ROI. This will bring an influx of NO. Secondly, after withdrawals are enabled, I envisage a lot of solo stakers making the transition over. People have already alluded to this, but in a post merge world where MEV and tips dominate, as a solo staked the odds are against you. Not only can you run twice as many validators, but RocketPool will have a smoothing pool, which means a more standardised APR (as opposed to a lottery in proposing a high fee block).</p>\n\n<p>Smart contract risk. Despite all the audits, it\u2019s still a new protocol and so some people would rather wait until it\u2019s battle tested. This may be 3 months, it may be 12. But once it\u2019s proven to be reliable, this will attract more NOs and more rETH buyers.</p>\n\n<p>CEX listings. I\u2019m not sure why the would. It would get confusing. Rather, they may change their approach at the backend, and it may actually be CEXs spinning up minipools. Why? APR. APR will dominate and if an exchange does nothing then their proposition becomes less attractive. If they start farming RPL rewards too, the APR increases. More people use their service. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what the status quo is, they will need to remain competitive.</p>\n\n<p>Some more things to consider;</p>\n\n<p>L2 adoption. Currently buying rETH is generally expensive. But with greater L2 adoption from retail, it will become a quick and easy way to start staking. We may even see people move from exchanges once they enable direct withdrawals (APY - exchanges won\u2019t be able to react as quickly initially and <em>hopefully</em> people understand better the merits of decentralisation and client diversity).</p>\n\n<p>Devs and leadership. I\u2019ve only recently joined Rocket Pools Discord and I\u2019m very impressed by the discussions going on. It\u2019s a good sign when you feel like the dumbest person in the room. They have a lot of things planned to help grow Rocket Pool, including just basic marketing. Everybody loves a meme.</p>\n\n<p>Unbonded minipools and DVT. At some point in the future it will be possibly to own any amount of RPL and start a minipool with others. This will be huge for adoption and you get more NO\u2019s again.</p>\n\n<p>I mean there\u2019s plenty more, but the one thing needed at the moment is time.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-04 00:45:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hvjfiz1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sk5vmt","parent_id":"t1_hvj3zh6","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/monkeyhold99","body":"It's because most people who wanted to stake have already staked their ETH through centralized services or Lido.

They\u2019ve basically stripped them of their privacy for no other reason but to drive clicks to their site.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If they had investigated and found out that they were criminals or had a history of fraud, or had reason to suspect suspicious or illicit behavior then there\u2019s possibly an argument. But they found nothing. And they exposed them anyway. I don\u2019t think it should be hard to see why that\u2019s fucked up</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-04

Which might not be worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, getting aEth loan on Alchemix is only good </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>if you really need money now</p></li>\n<li><p>if you think ETH will not go up</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You could also take the loan in Alchemix using USDC (or dai I am not sure), so your loan is indexed in dollars. This is better to avoid trapping yourself, you only expose yourself to lost of gains against ETH (you won&#39;t make money during this time span if ETH goes up, but you also won&#39;t lock eth for very long time period)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-04 16:30:01","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-02-04 16:33:14","id":"hvmx4dt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sk5vmt","parent_id":"t1_hvmiavd","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"borrow against your ETH using alchemix to fund your bank account?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>borrow against your ETH using alchemix to fund your bank account?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-04 14:44:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hvmi6wm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sk5vmt","parent_id":"t1_hvmhr40","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/pocketwailord","body":"Went the 20% route with a private lender and waited a week with the money in my bank account before they gave the approval.
