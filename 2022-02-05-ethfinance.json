Look at [this recent transaction](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x26684e164470b940663f1e3145c1d2d3bf099f3c7a0a56d2d655233242bbc095):\n\n* The max fee is 2.4250 wei\n* The priority fee (validator tip) is 2.4249 wei\n* The base fee is 37 wei. Yes: wei, not gwei. So 0.000000037 gwei.\n\nThe base fee is negligible and the priority fee is effectively the only fee. This means that we're essentially back to pre-1559 gas auction wars since the priority fee is all that matters. The priority fee is meant to be used as an auction mechanism to solve transaction priority during spikes, and the **base fee is meant to capture all the value long term**.\n\nIn other words: if you go to [watchtheburn.com](https://watchtheburn.com/) and look at the graph on the top right you should see mostly orange and a bit of yellow. During an NFT drop you should see a lot of yellow as people compete to get into the first blocks, and if the spike stops quickly yellow drops too, or if the spike continues for too long (i.e. strong price action) then orange should catch up soon-ish to capture all value, making yellow small again.\n\nThis is not what's happening on Polygon because if that were the case, the base fee (orange) would rise to ~2 gwei, making the tip (yellow) < 0.5 gwei.\n\nSo why is this happening? Well, if you look at block data you'll see full blocks followed by empty blocks:\n\n* [24591010](https://polygonscan.com/block/24591010) - Full - Base fee 41 wei\n* [24591011](https://polygonscan.com/block/24591011) - Empty - Base fee 46 wei (rose because prev. block was full)\n* [24591012](https://polygonscan.com/block/24591012) - Full - Base fee 41 wei (dropped because prev. block was empty)\n* [24591013](https://polygonscan.com/block/24591013) - Empty - Base fee 46 wei (rose because prev. block was full)\n\nThis is abnormal. 1559 aims for blocks to be 50% full, so this must be some sort of validator bug where blocks take too long to process and therefore one block is full and the next block is empty because the validator was too busy processing the previous... maybe? I'm not really sure how the validation software works in Polygon.\n\nHow long has this been going on? Well if you look at block [24579987](https://polygonscan.com/block/24579987) from 8 hours ago, it's 47% relative to the gas target which is pretty normal. But the base fee is still very low (14 wei).\n\nIf you keep going to previous blocks it seems like most of them are below the gas target which explains the low gas fee. If blocks never fill, the protocol can't increase the fee. Maybe this means that there's just not enough demand for Polygon blockspace most of the time, and that blocks only get filled during spikes? Maybe this means that the 1559 model doesn't work for high-throughput chains?\n\nI'm not an expert so I can't really explain, but the Economics 101 reason for a low price is high supply and low demand, and that seems to be what's happening. But if 1559 can't reliably price the network then it's no use: its whole point is to make gas more predictable and avoid gas wars.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So Polygon&#39;s EIP-1559 implementation doesn&#39;t seem to be going so well.

Also LUSD lost its peg pretty significantly a couple of weeks ago during all that bear nonsense.\n\nAll that said, the biggest pro for liquity is that after you pay the initial borrowing fee (0.5\u066a right now), there is no interest incurred by your loan.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Have used liquity, compound and aave.
