They need to hear from you that you value client diversity! There are rumors that some of the large staking services are planning on shifting to minority clients as a result of comments they have been receiving.

I have pasted it below, please reach out to customer service today!\n\nDear <staking services provider>,\n\nI am currently staking <X> Ether with your service. I love that you have made this process of obtaining passive income from Ether easy for me.\n\nHowever, I am concerned that you may be using the Ethereum consensus client Prysm for running your validators and consensus nodes. Prysm is currently a supermajority client, with roughly 2/3 of the total Beacon Chain validators running it. This is very problematic for several reasons, and as a customer of yours, if you are using Prysm I would like to ask you to please switch to a minority client such as Teku, Nimbus, or Lighthouse, or at the very least an even distribution of the available clients. Ideally, no single client would have more than 33% of the total stake. If you are using Prysm, I will not be staking further Ether with you until you resolve this issue.\n\nTo be clear, if you are using a majority Ethereum consensus client like Prysm, it puts my funds, and the stability of the Beacon Chain, and of Ethereum as a whole, at risk. If problems were to emerge with that client's implementation, at best the inactivity leak from a majority of all validators experiencing the same downtime would lead to a loss of staking rewards for me and all of your staking clients. Worse, it could lead to mass slashing and heavy loss of our funds. And worst of all, it could lead to major consensus failures and chain splits on Ethereum, which would be bad if it were to happen now, and catastrophic to the entire crypto ecosystem (the source of all of your profits as a staking service provider and crypto exchange) if it were to happen after the Merge.\n\nAs your staking customer, if you are using Prysm I strongly urge you to switch to a minority client for your staking services, and will not be staking further Ether with you until you can confirm to me that you are not using Prysm.\n\nThank you very much,\n<Your name>","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For anyone staking ETH on Coinbase or other large hosting service, it&#39;s important that you reach out to customer service about the fact that\u00a0Prysm continues to\u00a0dominate the beacon chain.

Because at this point, basically you have cancelled (yes I hate using that word, but it&#39;s true) someone for their views. </p>\n\n<p>And you could argue that &quot;oh but his views were discriminatory&quot;. But, that opens the door for an entire Pandora&#39;s box of extra-judicial punishments down the line. Someone supports Trump and therefore is a racist by proxy? Remove him from his web3 role! Someone supports AOC and therefore hates the libertarian culture of web3? Remove him from his web3 role!</p>\n\n<p>The witch-hunts would be endless. I think this is why any &quot;punishment&quot; needs to be measured, to send the right message to the lgbtq+ people that they are valued and wanted in web3, but also to not start a slippery slope of people getting fired for their (distasteful) opinions and importing the culture wars from the old world to web3</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-06 14:39:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hvvbhoc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_slpdz0","parent_id":"t1_hvv7dwp","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Yep.

He's doing too much harm. If he does get allowed to stay in his position, ENS is going to lose a lot of incredibly diverse and interesting and thoughtful and vulnerable people, who are currently very optimistic about web3 and the capacity of these types of organization to self-organize around fixing problems like this.\n\nAlso, I totally realized I was making the mistake of false equivalency when thinking about him. I was like, \"yes he said hateful things, but exiting him from his role would be exclusionary towards people with his religious background, so we need to find some middle ground.\"\n\nNo. Someone's intolerance is not equivalent to another person's tolerance. Hate is hate, and religion is absolutely not an excuse. You have to ask, is a person doing harm with their words and actions? If they are, it doesn't matter the how and why, that is not acceptable, *most especially* in a position of power in a place that hopes to be open and safe for everyone. And it was made really painfully clear that his words were doing a whole lot of harm. \n\nFor me, a privileged guy in basically every advantaged class, those words were just ugly and uncomfortable to read, but that was it. But more than one person speaking in that Space described how they had literally lost trans or gay/bi friends and relatives to suicide because of how often they were told that they don't exist or are evil, in exactly the same way Brantly was repeatedly doing. People spoke about how their families were broken by that kind of religious intolerance. And to be clear, words are just as powerful as actual violence. They are potent. Hate speech is given its own category because of how much harm it can do. He is doing harm.\n\nHe really has no road to reconciliation and keeping his current post at ENS - several people said that if he had been willing to do the work, if he had owned up to his previous tweet being super harmful and that he no longer identified with it, and was willing to figure out how to change and be more accepting, there might've been a path to him staying on without his presence hurting many people. But as it was, he has basically ignored all those chances he was given to apologize and figure out how to move forward, and has instead complained of being victimized for his beliefs. For his own hateful beliefs! Bro, you're not the victim here. You're getting called out for victimizing others. To be clear, this is not canceling someone for their beliefs. It's calling out the literal harm they are doing with their hate speech to a large number of vulnerable people in our community, and taking steps to limit further harm from being done.\n\nSo yeah, from a web3/crypto perspective, it will be extremely interesting to see how this plays out. Either the DAO votes to exit him from his leadership positions (I didn't hear much of a call to kick him out of the ENS organization entirely, just to get him out of his position of power), or I think ENS is going to find itself heading in a pretty bad direction pretty fast. The early signs seem promising, but we'll just have to see.\n\nSide note: the amount of diversity web3 is attracting is freaking beautiful. If we can pull this off so that the space continues to be as open and welcoming as it has been so far, it's going to be a historically important achievement for diversity and opportunity. Of course it won't fix everything, but it will level a lot of playing fields that have been super uneven so far.  There were multiple callouts about how web3 has enabled many of these people (especially sex workers) to make a living in places where tradfi and web2 was just outright excluding and cutting them off. 'Direct resourcing' was spoken of, where if you want to make a difference, just sending Eth straight to someone you've seen doing important work is a great way to help. \n\nIt's just incredibly exciting to hear about how this technology is really, really helping improve the world, at the level of individuals! Hearing the actual voices of some of these incredible people really drove it home to me, just sitting and listening as hard as I could for a few hours.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wow.</p>\n\n<p>Listened through most of that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1gqGvlBodLpxB\">ENS Twitter Spaces</a> this evening.</p>\n\n<p>There were some incredibly powerful and brave and thought-provoking voices in there.</p>\n\n<p>Main takeaway: there is absolutely no way Brantly stays on with ENS in his leadership positions.

None of that has any bearing on whether governance votes could boot him out.

In fact, I\u2019d argue that because his messages would stay on chain forever, more people would see those messages and push for a vote to boot him out. More people might rush to defend him too.
