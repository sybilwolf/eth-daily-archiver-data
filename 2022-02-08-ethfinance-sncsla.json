It's got a lot of good information in there.\n\nSome things I learned:\n\n1) When the Frax stablecoin expands because it's above the peg the stablecoins go into the Curve+Convex pool and are used for farming. Alchemix is in the works of adopting this same AMO model using their transmuter pool funds. It's less money in the transmuter but it deepens the alUSD liquidity on Curve using protocol funds and the farmed CRV is sold and used like the transmuter boost is now so there will still be some yield.\n\n2) Filling in a blank a bit I'm pretty sure he's saying that tokens like Frax which will be valid collateral for an alUSD loan will use Convex farms as their yield source (not just Yearn). It's not clear to me whether this means the user deposits frax3CRV or just deposits Frax. If you have a choice of using Convex for yield (which I do a lot right now) and using Alchemix for yield and getting CDP functionality for leveraged yield + the AMO/transmuter boost, the choice should be clear to take the higher yield and extra functionality. The downside to using alUSD right now is the DAI yield is so much less than yield I can get elsewhere in the ecosystem that I *have* to leverage it to make it competitive. This is true even with the current transmuter boost. Being able to deposit my highest yield base asset as a starting point will be a game changer.\n\n3) Bribe competition is heating up a lot in Convex. The multiplier of bribe efficiency used to be >5:1, it's falling to 2:1 recently. You can see this in the yield you get for voting with your CVX which is ludicrously high already and apparently could still double if the CRV+CVX price hangs out here.\n\n4) Scoopy thinks alUSD could supplant mUSD as a meta-stable coin with basket exposure to a bunch of underlying. I see what he's getting at but I'm not convinced. I personally find mUSD boring but if alUSD just like absorbs that use case as well, I can't complain.\n\n5) The Alchemix DAO is getting about 900 TOKE per day from their tALCX pool. That's an impressive alternative to bonding.\n\n6) Alchemix is deploying to Fantom as it's first alternative to L1. Still waiting for Yearn to deploy to Arbitrum to follow there.\n\n7) They are doing something with their L2 alAssets that I don't understand yet. alAssets between L2's will be fungible. alAssets on L1 have a more protected status. I can't complain about the design goal, but I don't understand the mechanism they are using just from this talk.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Leo just pointed me at <a href=\"https://koji.capital/listen/scoopy-trooples/#\">this</a> podcast with Scoopy from Alchemix.

Needed 43920; closed 43868. Obviously the current pump is well past that but it must hold.\n   * It's above 20 and 50 Day MAs, heading for the $46k range where it'll test the underside of the might 20 Week MA.\n   * The weekly Stoch RSI is firmly upward moving and in fact the faster average has crossed back above 20. Should the slower average join it above 20, well... There has been only a single fake out in the past eight years -- in January 2019 -- wherein buying off the upward cross and selling on the subsequent downward cross resulted in one losing money. That is, it's highly probable that we'd get an opportunity to profit or break even before even an out-of-the-blue sudden downturn.\n   * Monthly is still very bearish and matches the dead cat bounces of 2018. A -32% March led to a +32% April led to -30% May/June. Or perhaps we match July when BTC rode the 21 Month EMA as it is now.  June 2018 was -14%, July was +21%, and then Aug 2018-Jan 2019 was -57%...\n* ETH is a similar rhyming song with different chords\n   * Above our 50 Week at 3050, unlike BTC. Yet below our 50 Day MA at 3230, also unlike BTC.\n   * And about a candle behind on the abovementioned monthly metrics.\n* Stocks - inside trading day.\n   * Bulls couldn't close SPY above 451 and bears couldn't close it below 446. These are your breakout numbers to watch.\n   * All major indices SPY, DIA, QQQ, and IWM are rolling over on the daily Stoch RSI. The only one to confirm rollover is the QQQ so far. For completeness, the number to watch there is 352.\n   * IWM is still in a bear market.  - It can't seem to close above 200 (2010 on the full fat Russell 2000) to save its damn life so that would be bullish if it could.
