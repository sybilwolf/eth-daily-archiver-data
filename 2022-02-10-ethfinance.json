You have to look for online only lenders that do high volume and pass a percentage of their profit to you as lender credit that covers closing costs and then some. I have purchased and refinanced multiple times and have always ended up profiting on every closing and still get the best rate and better rate compared to what big banks offer. Yes, I said \"PROFITING\" on closing costs and never paid closing costs\n\n>and then come to find out the loan's interest is all front loaded so when you think you get a low rate your actually paying like 70% interest then the rest towards your principle.\n\nAre you serious? This really shows you did no homework. Say you are buying a 500K home, with 100K down-payment and get a 400K loan for 30 years. What do you think you are going to pay the first month? 30 day interest for the full 400K and then a little bit of principal (say $400). For 2nd month? Another 30 day interest for the the 396.6K plus may be $405 in principal. This is how it works. How else can you borrow money? If you take a 15 year loan at 2% or 3% rate, then you might pay more principal than interest from the very first month. Sorry for being harsh, but again, you did not do your homework on how things work and had unreal expectations\n\n>Again it may be slightly better than renting but it just came as a real shock to how the system is stacked against you.\n\nThis totally varies from person to person. Depending on where you live, if you need more space/yard, how good the real-estate market goes up in your state/city. In general, homeowners come out ahead. But again, that's very generic assumption. Just varies based on what you are getting into. Real estate lets you leverage. On my above 500K example, if the home goes up to 700K in 5 years, then you made 200K on your 100K investment. You probably would have paid 50K in interests and say 25K in maintenance, prop tax, etc. You are still 125K ahead (200K minus 75K). So your 100K turned into 225K. That's 125% returns in 5 years.  And I don't  do 20% down-payment. Only 5%. So 25K down-payment investment turned into 150K. 6x in 5 years. So think about how much you are able to leverage in real-estate. Its not rocket science! Again, not all 500K houses will be 700K in 5 years. So you have to be in right place. Even if it goes up only to say 550K, you are probably down 25K overall (50K appreciation minus 50K in interest, prop tax, minus 25K in maintenance). Its like paying 25K rent for 5 years. That is still good. Granted, you got your 5% down payment and monthly principal payment locked and there is opportunity cost, but thats the gamble.

Some are easier to do than others, and almost all of the tokenization of real world assets that I can think of will require some levels of trust beyond purely digital tokens/assets, but that\u2019s still better than the prior system where physical goods have problems like being less liquid and useful in their current form than in a highly composable and feature rich digital ecosystem.\n\n>\tOr even for digital goods, blockchain has not solved the problem of where to hold the data.\n\nThere\u2019s still lots of problems with blockchains, but a lot in the past has been solved and there are reasonable solutions to most of the big current problems now like scalability, oracle solutions, etc\n\nFor where to store larger data files in a decentralized way, solutions like IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave are good places to start.\n\n>\tIn regards to privacy, how can a decentralized open ledger be private? Blockchain can not really be transparent and enable privacy at the same time. If there are solutions being worked on to address this, then please shill them.\n\nThis is where the layered nature of blockchains and composability come into play. Some aspects of what\u2019s on chain will be private, but that\u2019s a choice at the app layer by the deployer/creator of the contract. Privacy is good in some contexts but there are trade offs with getting that feature, which is why Ethereum itself is not inherently private at the base layer. This was a conscious decision and speaks to the minimalistic and permissionless nature of Ethereum (if you want to build or use private apps or transfers, you can.
