COVID protocol is to have everyone take a free rapid test on the way in to registration, so fairly thorough. Masks are recommended but compliance is probably around 5%. Anyway, the structure of the conference generally has things ramping up over time. Everything today was done at the Art Hotel, with more venues opening up next week. The Art Hotel has one stage, with a seating capacity of maybe 100 people. Popular talks filled most seats with another couple dozen standing in the back (and plenty of people already out networking and building). Organizers report over 2000 people having checked in already (they expected more like 500 at this point), with a total of 15k expected. Got a little crowded for my tastes, but it is cool to walk around and overhear conversations about bridges, tokenomics, and gas fees.\n\nWith just the one stage open now, there was a steady stream of 20 minute talks from 10 AM to 6 PM. Not even an official lunch break. These should all be on youtube or twitch as well. Some notable talks include:\n\n* [CJ Hetherington of Atlantis World](https://youtu.be/lB-QGODjWnM) showed off their 2D metaverse platform. I don't know how I feel about the metaverse concept in general, but what I liked about Atlantis World was the integration of composable tools and dapps. You can walk your character over to the metamask building, where an NPC will walk you through setting up your metamask wallet. Then walk over to locations representing your favorite dapps to use them. Maybe you can say the walking is a waste of time, but the visual metaphors are kind of compelling for making defi approachable. They're also committed to not making a walled garden.\n* [Renat Khasanshyn](https://youtu.be/zGx4v3eG3p0) gave a talk on the state of decentralized insurance (e.g. covering smart contract hacks and depegging stablecoins). I felt like it was an informative talk about an area that doesn't get a lot of attention. General impression is that insurance is still relatively small and niche; Renat suggested that institutions and conservative investors may be waiting for more insurance tools to scale up before they'd feel comfortable entering the space, but then will contribute to defi growth. Bit of a chicken and egg problem. If you're trying to find sub-sectors in crypto that haven't taken off yet and haven't thought about insurance, maybe that's a possible area for some research.\n* [Matt West](https://youtu.be/rn-PHSqDAK0) is a crypto dev running for congress in Oregon's 6th congressional district. He gave a talk (competent enough public speaker), mostly just a fundraising pitch, but emphasizing the need for some real crypto advocates in US congress. And yeah, we've definitely seen a decent amount of hostility from congress over the years, would be nice to have an advocate. Matt suggested that he actually has a decent shot at this, as he is running as a democrat in a democrat-leaning area, there is no incumbent, and initial data is suggesting he has one serious primary competitor. Thinks $2 million in funding would be enough to run a campaign and win it. He's asking for donations from the crypto community; I won't endorse him any more than I've done here but he has a website in case you want to google it and support him.\n* [Marc Mercuri of ConsenSys](https://youtu.be/60QSEjVw7SQ) went over a few new tools they're releasing in the coming weeks. First, integration between truffle suite and VS Code. I only have limited experience with VS Code myself, but I know it has a large fanbase, and the integration seems quite good. Second, the ConsenSys Ethereum Connector, which integrates into workflow tools like Microsoft Logic Apps. The sample use case he explained was setting it up so any time you upload a picture from your phone to a certain folder in your Adobe cloud, it automatically uploads it to IPFS, mints it as an NFT, and sends you a text with the tx hash. Could be useful.\n* [Eric Mack](https://youtu.be/DYI8eNhZknM) gave a talk on how web3 can revitalize journalism. He admitted that this is a long term vision, and it's only been recently that we can even talk about what it means without people thinking you're crazy. But in general he discussed some ideas for how Web3 could fix the misaligned incentive structures in traditional media, help enable citizen journalism, and lead to DAOs purchasing struggling local news outlets to revolutionize them and keep them alive.\n* [Alex Salnikov, co-founder and CPO at Rarible](https://youtu.be/NJ75t6lf7rM), got interviewed on stage about the current and future state of NFT marketplaces. Given the recent negativity around NFT PFPs on social media, it was nice hearing from someone who has a real appreciation for them. Most noteworthy line was \"community is the only scarce thing in the metaverse.\" That is, he believes most PFP collections become valuable because ownership entails some degree of membership in the community surrounding them. He thinks in the future we will see some shifting from traders who buy PFP NFTs as investments to consumers who buy a PFP NFT that aligns with their identity and is within their price range to just own indefinitely. Also thinks 2022 will be a big year for financialization of NFTs (integration into defi, think NFTX but more). Doesn't think NFTs will become big on L2 until ZK rollups are established because of the long withdrawal time from optimistic rollups. He's confused as to why music NFTs haven't taken off yet but thinks it may be because the way we consume music is fundamentally different from the way we consume images, and musicians/marketplaces haven't figured it out yet.\n* [Omer Goldberg of Chaos Labs](https://youtu.be/V3kzJZx4jlE) talked about how to model risk for cross-chain bridges. Provided a list of criteria: latency, security, complexity, overhead, and reusability. Also discussed how the underlying architectures (external validators, light clients, and liquidity networks) can affect these criteria. I didn't find it groundbreaking, but good info to know especially given recent events.\n* [Beau Shinkle of Threshold](https://youtu.be/3nmKU0_YCuU) talked about the difficulties in trying to build a fully trustless bridge from Bitcoin to Ethereum, tBTC. So while the na\u00efve solution is to force the bridge operators to lock up more ETH than the BTC value as collateral (so if they steal the BTC the tBTC users get the ETH), it's hard it incentivize people to lock up that much. So maybe you make some assumptions that x% of your operators are honest and won't steal from the protocol on principle, even if there's a small profit to be had. This lets you relax your collateral requirements under a sort of probabilistic security model. Beau was very clear that this has its own downsides, but laid out the tradeoffs of either side.\n\nOkay, don't expect me to write up this much every day. From here on, going to continue to be a steady stream of talks. I need to find some ways to strike up conversations with people or something, because I didn't really talk to anyone today but it would be nice to meet folks and I think I should probably force myself to find a buidling team within the next few days. Ugh, I wasn't even good at this before the pandemic, and now my social skills are even more obliterated.

And midterm election years are also weak, seeing intrayear drawdowns averaging -16% or so, which is right around where markets are.

I love that you have made this process of obtaining passive income from Ether easy for me.\n\nHowever, I am concerned that you may be using the Ethereum consensus client Prysm for running your validators and consensus nodes. Prysm is currently a supermajority client, with roughly 2/3 of the total Beacon Chain validators running it. This is very problematic for several reasons, and as a customer of yours, if you are using Prysm I would like to ask you to please switch to a minority client such as Teku, Nimbus, or Lighthouse, or at the very least an even distribution of the available clients. Ideally, no single client would have more than 33% of the total stake. If you are using Prysm, I will not be staking further Ether with you until you resolve this issue.\n\nTo be clear, if you are using a majority Ethereum consensus client like Prysm, it puts my funds, and the stability of the Beacon Chain, and of Ethereum as a whole, at risk. If problems were to emerge with that client's implementation, at best the inactivity leak from a majority of all validators experiencing the same downtime would lead to a loss of staking rewards for me and all of your staking clients. Worse, it could lead to mass slashing and heavy loss of our funds. And worst of all, it could lead to major consensus failures and chain splits on Ethereum, which would be bad if it were to happen now, and catastrophic to the entire crypto ecosystem (the source of all of your profits as a staking service provider and crypto exchange) if it were to happen after the Merge.\n\nAs your staking customer, if you are using Prysm I strongly urge you to switch to a minority client for your staking services, and will not be staking further Ether with you until you can confirm to me that you are not using exclusively Prysm.\n\nThank you very much, <Your name>","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hello Ethfinance!</p>\n\n<p>If you are staking any amount of ETH with a service such as coinbase and have reached out to see which client they are using then please consider a followup message!
