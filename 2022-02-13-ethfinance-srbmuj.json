I mostly blame the super bowl, as it meant that official programming ended around 2pm, and while there are some super bowl parties hosted by various teams, the ones on the schedule are all sold out and I don't know if I'd be interested in the first place. But then there was also a ETHDenver hike at Red Rocks this morning, which is more up my alley. I helped drive some people out there and back, but took the chance to do a long run because I have trail races this summer and can't afford to slack on my training. So I did miss 5 talks this morning. If anyone attended the art stage talks between 10:20-12:00 MST or saw them online, I would love to hear some summaries! I've got some other things to catch up on tonight.\n\nOf the talks I was around for:\n\n* [Maggie Love of SheFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxc9vBOkgFc) gave a long \"Blockchain 101\" talk. I didn't expect I'd learn much from it, so I intended to skip it and see the following talk (on the technical arcitecture of bonding curves, which never happened), but I guess the schedule got changed without warning and Maggie was only halfway through when I arrived. It seemed like a fine intro to blockchain talk, though I probably could have given it (maybe not as well) (and so could most of you, I assume). My biggest complaint is that her slide on PoS said that Ethereum is transitioning from PoW to PoS and that PoS enables 100k TPS. Which is not true, and will only further the erroneous narrative that the merge will solve scaling problems. Otherwise, fine talk.\n* [Zooko, founder of Zcash](https://youtu.be/t62isi58XcQ), was interviewed on stage about a number of things. He's quite a character, told a lot of good stories about the history of cryptography, regulation, and the creation of Zcash. Would be a fun video to watch rather than read a summary about. He's concerned not just about privacy from the standard 1984-style dystopias, but also privacy from behavior modification tactics that use your personal data to influence your spending habits or political views. He talked about Halo, an upgrade to Zcash coming in March that removes the need for a trusted setup and uses recursive proofs. He's also not worried about quantum computers breaking crypto, which I also believe except maybe in the context of a protocol like Bitcoin that actively resists change.\n* And that's it. Short day of talks, made shorter by the hike/run.\n\nTomorrow, though, more venues open up! This means nice full schedules, but also means I can no long sit in one place and attend everything. Going to have to pick and choose what seems most interesting.\n\nOn the side of my own personal experience here, I did actually talk to people today! I didn't implement the superphiz \"help me find a team\" pin on my shirt (yet) since I figured I'd only be at the venue for an hour, but I did post to the #find-a-team channel on the ETHDenver discord and at least made a few introductions with people I'll talk with in more depth tomorrow. While standing by a nice warm fire I was also approached by a couple different people who just walked up and said hi (you can do that? what sorcery is this??). Common conversation topics are what you do for work (especially if in crypto), what you're building for the hackathon here, and just generally chatting about cool crypto projects. One of them asked me what my best crypto investments have been (which I guess is fine, but I don't generally talk crypto investments with family+friends so it caught me off guard) and I said \"it feels like a risk to buy anything else when I could hold ETH instead\", he asked more about the risky stuff, and I talked about the stupid returns I got on ConstitutionDAO $PEOPLE.
