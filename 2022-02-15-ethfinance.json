Your examples demonstrate perfectly how an element of decentralizion in supply chains is often optimal, which pretty much agrees with my point that diversity = resilience.\n\nBut it is worth noting the counter-point that even your examples assume **an optimal amount of measured decentralization**, not decentralization per se.

The atmosphere of having stuff scattered around between a number of different local venues is cozy, but we're really bursting at the seams at popular events. We could really use one or two auditoriums with seating for 200-400. Maybe the sports castle will be bigger, but it's only opening up tomorrow, more than halfway through the whole thing.\n\nToday's talks:\n\n* [Hilmar Orth, founder of Gelato](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/vqUJ/how-to-automate-your-smart-contracts-using-gelato?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), introduced Gelato, which is a multi-chain (EVM) tool for automating smart contract calls. I had seen a similar idea in a presentation about Chainlink keepers, and I'm not quite sure what the main differences are between them. Both of them can be set up to call a smart contract function either on a timer or when some condition (checked by another function) is met. One of the main demonstrated examples was automatically claiming and reinvesting smart contract dividends, but only once there's enough to justify the gas fees. I play Cryptoraiders a bit, which recently introduced bonding via Olympus Pro, where yield is a much more manual process than sitting on an incentivized LP. Something like Gelato could definitely automate that process.\n* [Ari Rodriguez of Gelato](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/vqUJ/how-to-automate-your-smart-contracts-using-gelato?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) then went on to talk about G-UNI, a product they've built on top of Gelato. G-UNI takes a Uniswap V3 LP NFT and creates a public pool of ERC20 tokens from it. As long as the tokens all trace back to a LP NFT with the same price range, they are actually fungible. Gelato handles some automation to make it work smoothly. The end result is that you get the capital efficiency of Uniswap V3 with the usability of Uniswap V2. This includes liquidity incentives like LP renting or protocol owned liquidity. Apparently 28.5% of Uniswap V3 TVL on Optimism is in G-UNI pools, which is cool.\n* [Allison Duettmann of the Foresight Institute](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/vyFF/desciethdenver-crypto-economic-approaches-to-existential-risks?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) gave a DeSci talk on existential risks (the kind of things that could wipe out humanity). Looked at both how cryptoeconomic approaches could reduce these risks, but also the possibility for crypto to be its own source of risk. The Foresight Institute just released a [book](https://foresightinstitute.substack.com/) (digital, free online) that covers these topics and includes interviews with some of the most prominent researchers working to address the risks. I thought I was kind of informed in this area before, but there were way too many times when Allison said \"raise your hand if you've heard of fjlaskhfid\" and I had no idea what that was and apparently very few other people in the room did either. We kind of need to catch up as a community here.\n* [There was a StarkNet 101 talk](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/wruJ/starknet-101-what-is-it-how-it-works-why-it-will-blow-your-mind?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) that I was excited for. But I gave up my seat between sessions to get lunch, and when I returned (10 minutes after the session started) there was no room to stand in the venue, let alone sit down. I had done the [cairo intro homework they recommended](https://github.com/l-henri/starknet-cairo-101), but it wasn't worth it to stand in the entryway where I could barely hear or see. So I guess I'm a little relieved that /u/llamachef said they knew almost everything in the session already, because at least that means I maybe didn't miss out on crucial new info.\n* So instead of the StarkNet talk I went back to some more DeSci, this time [a series of talks from projects in the space](https://opscientia.notion.site/DeSci-EthDenver-c74fc532cccc4979b9cf7977b4ee17ea). It was fine. I took a bit of a post-lunch nap through part of it. I don't know why I'm sometimes bouncing off the DeSci stuff even though I am theoretically pretty interested in it. Maybe it's just too early, lots of ideas that aren't even proofs of concept that seem like they'll fight a large uphill battle to get more than 10 users.\n* [Kevin Neilson of Moonbeam and Stephen Shelton of PureStake](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTg2/enabling-cross-chain-assets-on-moonbeam-with-xcm?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about the movement of assets on Polkadot's parachains--specifically the EVM-compatible Moonbeam--using XCM. It's been a long time since I read up on Polkadot, so this was a nice little update. However, XCM seems very specific to Polkadot and the architecture of its relay chain. I don't think the lessons learned here can really be applied to general cross-chain bridges, and have little, if any, applicability to Ethereum L2s.\n* [Blockdaemon hosted a social event](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/v4yl/nodes-validators-and-staking-for-eth?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), which was mistakenly labeled as a talk about ETH staking in the schedule. I showed up expecting talks but got free dinner instead, so I'm not complaining too much. Anyway, Blockdaemon runs services where they'll host blockchain nodes, PoS validators, or RPCs for (generally institutional) clients. I asked one of their devs what they're doing about beacon chain client diversity, and the response I got was that they're trying to maintain equal proportions, which is great. I didn't need to start preaching to them.\n\nHad some good conversations with other attendees today! Though now I'm actually leaning away from doing a hackathon project. I'm more interested in attending talks and talking to a wide variety of people, just generally being an information sponge. Too big an opportunity cost in committing my time to coding when I could instead be infosponging. I'm pretty content continuing to do what I've been doing. I'll admit the days are starting to blur a bit; not much differentiates one day of talks from another. That's not a bad thing, but maybe there is a slight lack of overarching/guiding structure to the conference.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver Day 5</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ss3fis/daily_general_discussion_february_14_2022/hwzwf1g/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Before I get into it, my day 4 post yesterday got smacked by AutoModerator.

It provides a list of the top 100 subreddits a user has posted in and their most commonly used 100 words, excluding articles (the/a) and prepositions (in/on/etc.) I think. There are also graphs of their comments and submissions by date. You can use this information to identify users who bolster their reputation in karma farming subs like 'freekarma4you' as well as commonly upvoted subs like 'aww', 'pics', or any popular sports teams. There is obviously nothing wrong with someone posting on sites like that in general, but if an account only posted replies like \"cute bunny\" or \"go ManU!\" for years and then suddenly start spouting exclusively kremilin talking points then you might have reason for suspicion! \n\n\n* https://redditmetis.com/ - Is another site that analyzes a user, similar to reddit-user-analyser but in addition to displaying where and when they post and get karma it also will actually use their posts to extract information they have stated about themselves such as their employment, nationality etc. This shouldn't be taken as reliable as not only can it make mistakes but it also has no way of knowing if a user has lied. Some information has a # link next to it which leads you to the comment from which the information was extracted, this lets you consider context and judge it's veracity for yourself. Another great feature of redditmetis is the activity heatmap, showing when in the day a user posts. If they claim to be from Canada but they only post in working hours Moscow time then that may raise a red flag...\n\n\n* ~~https://www.redditinvestigator.com/~~ [currently OFFLINE] - Similar to the first two however much slower to generate the analysis. I'd suggest giving it a try, although I use it much less than the others. The one unique feature is that it extracts the website links used in submissions to show you if the user frequently links to certain sites. In the context of this conflict look for sites like RT (Russia Today) and Sputniknews being shared a lot.\n\n\n* https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/ - This site lets you search all comments a user has made on a certain sub, within a certain timeframe and/or including keywords. If you wanted to find all the posts made by account X in the sub Y that included the term Z you could do so. \n\n\n* https://redditcommentsearch.com/ - Does similar to the above but with less search options. No fields to limit date range for example, but otherwise perfectly useful. Sometimes simplicity is good.\n\n\n* https://www.unddit.com/ - Allows you to view deleted comments from discussions, assuming that the comments wasn't removed too quickly. You'll often see users arguing in what appears to be bad faith, spreading disinformation, then when someone disproves their bullshit or calls them out the bad-faith user may delete their comments, so when they try something similar again no-one can see that they shouldn't be trusted. This site provides you with a counter to these reputation management techniques, allowing you to view and share evidence of previous manipulation attempts that the user may think they have scrubbed from the record.\n\n\n* https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps - You can use this site to compare subreddit userbase similarities, as a kind of meta analysis of what you're doing by just checking profiles and useful if you see a subreddit that you don't recognize or start to see a pattern with lots of accounts posting in a certain sub.\n\n\nI hope that this lot is helpful, we're entering a period where I'm expecting disinfo here to really ramp-up, hopefully by working together we can counter it to a certain extent. Please, please copy and paste this comment wherever you like, especially when you see threads with suspicious accounts. Don't call them out directly as this may get you banned in some subs, and don't reply to them even to argue as the primary role maybe just to derail discussion and therefore crack a consensus that is forming. Instead just post this in reply to the person they are interacting with, or just wherever you like really.\n\nThank you so much for your time, I appreciate that this isn't directly on topic for this sub, and I really appreciate you taking the threat of misinformation and manipulation seriously enough to read through this lot.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Apologies for hijacking your comment here, just wanted to share some tools and resources that users discussing this topic should really be familiar with.

Instead of incentivizing trading (aka wash trading), they are incentivizing listing more NFTs on their platform, with 45% of the total token supply going to \"NFT staking\" rewards (really listing rewards), and it will be dispersed linearly over the next 720 days.\n\nI really like that approach, personally. I mean think about it. After all of the wash trading rewards are done on LooksRare, what will be left? Unless it just magically picks up more steam, nothing most likely. On the other hand, if the rewards are for listing on the platform, when the rewards run out, you will have potentially very high quality listings overall.\n\nBut really the most important metric that leads to high quality listings is number of unique users, which I'm sure everyone knows is a metric LR is not doing great in. That's why I also really like that X2Y2 is capping whale airdrops, and weighting the rest of the airdrops towards smaller users (aka the majority of users on OS). This gives users of all sizes a reason to go list their NFTs on X2Y2, and if everyone else is there too, may as well stay for the lower fees.\n\nFor those worried about the team taking a large chunk of the WETH rewards early on while also increasing their X2Y2 stack: first of all there is no mechanism that guarantees WETH rewards like LooksRare did. 100% of sales will have to be organic on X2Y2. However, it is also the case that the team doesn't get their first token unlock for 180 days, and the majority of the X2Y2 staking rewards will have been given out by then, so really it's a pretty modest compensation for them, at least comparatively to LR.\n\nSo is X2Y2 the most perfectest replacement for OpenSea and guaranteed to 1000x while bringing OS's valuation to $0? No, definitely not. While I think the tokenomics are a great setup for a successful long term vampire attack, my main concern is that it only works if you can reach the majority of OpenSea users and educate them about why it is better, and considering I hadn't heard about this until an hour before launch, I'm not too sure they have the ability to do that. It looks like the team might be from China so that may be part of the difficulty in marketing effectively.\n\nHowever, there is still a chance it could happen organically, and I think that chance is a lot higher than the chance of LooksRare happening organically, especially with the nice 'bulk import listings from OS' feature.

Large miners can get wholesale deals with power companies to pay half what a residential miner will pay. Larger still miners can use their own power with super cheap operating cost/opportunity cost power. The biggest miners such as Bitmain can produce the best ASICs themselves, or in Ethereum's case, can procure GPUs from higher up the distribution chain than you or I, allowing them to get bulk discounts or simply get orders in when store shelves are empty.\n\nThe economies of scale in crypto mining is the epitome of the rich getting richer. Hobbyist miners simply cannot compete in any meaningful way unless they just happen to live in a place with cheap power.\n\nProof of Stake on the other hand, now (thanks to RocketPool) gives everyone access to the same yield in a trustless manner, regardless of the size of your holdings. RocketPool offers around 4.5% while the solo staking rate is around 5%. This 0.5% difference in my experience is actually less than the running costs for bandwidth alone of running a single node (not including hardware!).

Large miners can get wholesale deals with power companies to pay half what a residential miner will pay. Larger still miners can use their own power with super cheap operating cost/opportunity cost power. The biggest miners such as Bitmain can produce the best ASICs themselves, or in Ethereum&#39;s case, can procure GPUs from higher up the distribution chain than you or I, allowing them to get bulk discounts or simply get orders in when store shelves are empty.</p>\n\n<p>The economies of scale in crypto mining is the epitome of the rich getting richer. Hobbyist miners simply cannot compete in any meaningful way unless they just happen to live in a place with cheap power.</p>\n\n<p>Proof of Stake on the other hand, now (thanks to RocketPool) gives everyone access to the same yield in a trustless manner, regardless of the size of your holdings. RocketPool offers around 4.5% while the solo staking rate is around 5%. This 0.5% difference in my experience is actually less than the running costs for bandwidth alone of running a single node (not including hardware!).
