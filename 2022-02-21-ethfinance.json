You can also look at the [ETHDenver Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver/). If you scroll down you can see \"EthereumDenver suggests these streamers\" with links to multiple numbered channels (e.g. [ethereumdenver6](https://www.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver6)). Each channel contains the recordings for a specific stage, as blocks for each whole day. Each of the schedule links I provide should say which stage it's on, and by looking at the event's time of day you may be able to track it down. Ideally they all end up findable on youtube, but this is a backup option if you're desperate.\n\nIn CO right now it's still actually Sunday for a bit, only been a few hours since I made the [day 10 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/swuaoz/daily_general_discussion_february_20_2022/hxsdl7x/). It's still relevant, no real updates since then. Happy to discuss it here or there.

This is a simple way to reduce your debt / short collateral. Let's say you've made a right guess that November was a cycle top, but you were only 70% sure. You could have swapped your debt to eth around Christmas (when eth was already in a downtrend, but there was a short windows with a bounce over 4k) and just went on vacation (keeping your exposure to the market, but not worrying about liquidating your entire position). But you were smart and you set up some notifications for prices (according to your models ofc). Then the January dumperino started, your notifications were all over the place and you were a bit drunk partying with models in Dubai. You didn't quite catch the bottom, but you reswapped your eth debt to stables @ 2200 per eth. So, even though ratio hasn't changed (it was frozen since December), you reduced your USD-denominated debt by 45% (4k -> 2.2k). You can try and do these bets on the way up too - eg swapping collateral from eth to matic at the start of December and reswapping it on 9th (sell the news) was a good idea. On the way down you can swap/reswap debt to sth different than your collateral if you think sth gonna drop faster than it.\nOf course, calculating liquidation price becomes tricky the more complicated setup you have, but it's possible (I've written tools for this in the past).
