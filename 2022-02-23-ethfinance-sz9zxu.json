All the data points to institutional investors leaning more heavily into Ethereum as time goes on. The trend literally couldn't be any more pronounced.\n\n> Just a few days ago the Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually non-compliant seucurities. And Ethereum is one the two cryptocurrencies that the SEC is first focusing on.\n\nSo what? You think the SEC is gonna ban Ethereum trading in the US, or something? Fat chance imo.\n\n> the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more.\n\nThe Ethereum leadership team didn't try any of that shit. Do you remember when the Ethereum Foundation launched their own official DeFi dapps? Do you remember the official Ethereum Foundation line of NFTs? Remember when the Ethereum Foundation officially advertised Ethereum as a store of value? I sure don't.\n\nThe core objective of the protocol is to provide a neutral computing platform to allow other people to launch whatever the hell they want. That objective hasn't changed, and Ethereum is executing on it spectacularly.\n\n> What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface\n\nAnd that \"extremely large attack surface\" has resulted in exactly how many protocol-level hacks so far? Zero. Less than Bitcoin which has had one protocol-level hack, the 2010 counterfeit bitcoin bug.\n\nEthereum's \"extremely large attack surface\" has resulted in *less* protocol-breaking bugs than Bitcoin.\n\n>  and huge scaling problems?\n\nPot calls kettle black. Even on its base layer, not accounting for any BTC/ETH Layer 2s, Ethereum does more TPS than Bitcoin.\n\n> Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation distribution rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum's inflation distribution rate and maximum supply adapt based on on-chain conditions, and will not be forced to change like Bitcoin's when its issuance runs dry. Bitcoin with a hard cap *and* a long term sustainable PoW security budget is a fairy tale that Bitcoiners tell each other before going to sleep.\n\n> Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Do you even remember the DAO contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him and he can do whatever he wants.\n\nThe \"entire community\" needed to come together and agree on something to get it done, yet Vitalik \"has full control\" over the project.\n\nI \"have full control\" over the entire world, as long as the entire world agrees with what I'm saying and agrees to come together and work on what I want them to.\n\n> Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules.\n\nThose miners were threatening to concentrate hashpower under a single actor as a \"show of force\" to show that they could attack the chain if they wanted to, that's the literal definition of a 51% attack. If they said they simply weren't going to follow us, we would have told them to screw off, the network difficulty would have dropped, and the Ethereum chain would have continued on without them.\n\nIronic as fuck that BashCo is handing out ban warnings to people for \"lying\" in the comments, while his post here has more lies in it than the rest of the thread combined. But I guess that's the /r/bitcoin moderation team in a nutshell, it's been that way ever since they banned discussion of Bitcoin XT in 2015.\n\n> The fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations.\n\nYeah and mining does too.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...if you don't like it, don't stake or mine. Amazing how simple that is.\n\n> Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.\n\nClassic PoS fud, ignoring the economies of scale in PoW mining that favor large datacenter owners and ASIC fab labs. With Ethereum, you can buy a fraction of an rETH on Arbitrum for a few hundred dollars and voila, you're earning staking revenue at a competitive rate. Now imagine what it takes to mine Bitcoin at competitive efficiency.\n\nAlso, I wonder what miners do with the bitcoins they mine? Do they perhaps... dump them on the open market?

Ethereum's current execution layer was never \"expected\" to scale without being updated. Major updates to the chain (namely off-chain execution and sharding) were always part of the roadmap, the updates to enable scaling were always \"expected\".\n\nIt's just as accurate to say that Bitcoin already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new off-chain data structure from scratch (Lightning Network), and I have no expectation that that new data structure will be any more successful at scaling than the current one.\n\nAnd Ethereum is not creating a whole new blockchain, that's also a lie. Ethereum is not starting from scratch, that's a complete fabrication and the exact opposite of the truth, don't know what more to say. The existing chain will continue to run indefinitely as the backbone, as its consensus model gets switched out and its capacity is augmented by additional features such as shards and Layer 2s.\n\nAlso, you've gotta love how BashCo directly contradicts himself within the same thread:\n\n> Just a few days ago the Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually non-compliant seucurities.

Doesn't really matter what the SEC says or doesn't say.\n\nSo according to BashCo, Ethereum is simultaneously under major scrutiny by the SEC, yet also not under scrutiny at all by the SEC. It simultaneously matters what the SEC says about Ethereum, yet it doesn't matter what the SEC says about Ethereum.\n\nI have a simple reply to BashCo, something he's been saying in that thread to people who challenge him, and one of his favorite replies to people before he bans them from his pet subreddit: **\"Stop lying.\"**\n\nI honestly hope I don't have the displeasure of reading a reply from BashCo, but if he does reply to me, I'll preemptively take another copypasta of his and repurpose it as my response to him: **\"You're free to argue with me.

All the data points to institutional investors leaning more heavily into Ethereum as time goes on. The trend literally couldn&#39;t be any more pronounced.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just a few days ago the Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually non-compliant seucurities. And Ethereum is one the two cryptocurrencies that the SEC is first focusing on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what? You think the SEC is gonna ban Ethereum trading in the US, or something? Fat chance imo.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They&#39;ve literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ethereum leadership team didn&#39;t try any of that shit. Do you remember when the Ethereum Foundation launched their own official DeFi dapps? Do you remember the official Ethereum Foundation line of NFTs? Remember when the Ethereum Foundation officially advertised Ethereum as a store of value? I sure don&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>The core objective of the protocol is to provide a neutral computing platform to allow other people to launch whatever the hell they want. That objective hasn&#39;t changed, and Ethereum is executing on it spectacularly.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that &quot;extremely large attack surface&quot; has resulted in exactly how many protocol-level hacks so far? Zero. Less than Bitcoin which has had one protocol-level hack, the 2010 counterfeit bitcoin bug.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum&#39;s &quot;extremely large attack surface&quot; has resulted in <em>less</em> protocol-breaking bugs than Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>and huge scaling problems?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pot calls kettle black. Even on its base layer, not accounting for any BTC/ETH Layer 2s, Ethereum does more TPS than Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin&#39;s inflation distribution rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum&#39;s inflation distribution rate and maximum supply adapt based on on-chain conditions, and will not be forced to change like Bitcoin&#39;s when its issuance runs dry. Bitcoin with a hard cap <em>and</em> a long term sustainable PoW security budget is a fairy tale that Bitcoiners tell each other before going to sleep.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Do you even remember the DAO contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik&#39;s buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him and he can do whatever he wants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The &quot;entire community&quot; needed to come together and agree on something to get it done, yet Vitalik &quot;has full control&quot; over the project.</p>\n\n<p>I &quot;have full control&quot; over the entire world, as long as the entire world agrees with what I&#39;m saying and agrees to come together and work on what I want them to.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not long ago ETH miners said they weren&#39;t going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those miners were threatening to concentrate hashpower under a single actor as a &quot;show of force&quot; to show that they could attack the chain if they wanted to, that&#39;s the literal definition of a 51% attack. If they said they simply weren&#39;t going to follow us, we would have told them to screw off, the network difficulty would have dropped, and the Ethereum chain would have continued on without them.</p>\n\n<p>Ironic as fuck that BashCo is handing out ban warnings to people for &quot;lying&quot; in the comments, while his post here has more lies in it than the rest of the thread combined. But I guess that&#39;s the <a href=\"/r/bitcoin\">/r/bitcoin</a> moderation team in a nutshell, it&#39;s been that way ever since they banned discussion of Bitcoin XT in 2015.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah and mining does too.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>...if you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t stake or mine. Amazing how simple that is.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Classic PoS fud, ignoring the economies of scale in PoW mining that favor large datacenter owners and ASIC fab labs. With Ethereum, you can buy a fraction of an rETH on Arbitrum for a few hundred dollars and voila, you&#39;re earning staking revenue at a competitive rate. Now imagine what it takes to mine Bitcoin at competitive efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I wonder what miners do with the bitcoins they mine? Do they perhaps... dump them on the open market? And at a much greater speed than stakers, because PoW issuance is a whole order of magnitude larger than PoS issuance?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Literally all just lies.
