Thanks legends!\n\n**Data sharding** was always on the roadmap. It was meant to accelerate rollups by providing data availability. Data availability shows us how we got from one state to another and allows anyone to reconstruct the latest state of the world. With data sharding the goal was to provide 1.3 MB/s capacity (10x current max capacity and 200x current typical capacity.)\n\n**Data availability sampling** lets each node download only a small chunk of data. Using a technique called **erasure coding**, just 50% of the data is sufficient to reconstruct the whole data. Another technique called **KZG commitments** is used to prove that the erasure coding is valid. You can think of KZG commitments as the zero-knowledge proofs of data availability.\n\nThe old design of data sharding had different committees for each shard. The new design is enabled by something called \u201c**Proposer-builder separation**\u201d, or PBS; where proposers are validators and builders are a separate dedicated role that only needs one honest builder. The added complexity of PBS necessitates Ethereum moving to [a two-slot system](https://i.imgur.com/UGRw5Km.png) (where beacon blocks and intermediate blocks alternate in the chain.) Each slot is 8 seconds, making the full block time 16 seconds. ([More on two slot PBS](https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980))\n\nThe danger with PBS is that an efficient builder can permanently censor some transactions at some economic cost. The solution is something called crLists; which allow proposers to force builders to include transactions by specifying a list of transactions that the builder must include. crLists allow us to be more comfortable with the PBS design.\n\ncrLists are still an evolving design space but [this is an illustration of a \u201chybrid PBS\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/KbtMdLK.png) where the proposer creates the crLists. Whenever the proposer has a slot they create a list of all transactions that they see in the mempool that are eligible to be included. They add another summary that only includes some basic facts about these transactions. The builder includes a hash of the crList and summary to confirm that they have seen it when they make a block bid. The proposer can accept this bid and then when the builder publishes their block they have to prove that they either included all of the transactions from the crLIst, or that the block is full.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, if we encode all our data in a KZG commitment then we can have efficient data availability. The reason why we do not just encode all the data we want to be available in a single KZG commitment is that we would need a super-node builder to build and reconstruct in the case of failure, which is not great. So instead, we encode many shard blobs in different KZG commitments for maximum resilience. This **2d KZG scheme** means all samples can be verified directly against commitments; No fraud proofs required! If 75%+1 samples are available, then all data is available and reconstructable without needing super-nodes.\n\nPulling all of this together; we have one block that\u2019s together the beacon block as well as all the shard proposal, and the committee has no other role than confirming that this is available all together. This is **Danksharding**. [A single committee, builder, committing to multiple data shards](https://i.imgur.com/5rbPEoq.png).\n\nWith Danksharding, execution and data availability are confirmed in the same block, making Ethereum a unified settlement and data availability layer!\n\nPreviously we needed shard committees because each shard blob could be unavailable individually. With Danksharding it\u2019s the builders responsibility that the execution block is valid and all shard blobs are available. Because of Danksharding\u2019s honest majority validation an unavailable block cannot get more than 1/16 attestations. With data availability sampling there is a 1 in a billion chance of an unavailable block passing. Also, 55,000 online validators can guarantee full reconstruction of all data.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n\\- It's a simpler design than data sharding\n\n\\- Makes things very easy for rollups\n\n\\- Synchronous calls between zk rollups and L1 are possible as they confirm in the same block\n\n\\- Full nodes will be able to ensure data availability with only 2.5 kB/s\n\n\\- Increased bribery resistance\n\n\\- The more peers you have, the faster things get","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Finally got around to watching the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9oudTr5BE4\">Danksharding workshop presentation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Just wanted to share my notes here for anyone who hasn&#39;t yet been able to watch it, which also includes some info from threads by <a href=\"/u/liberosist\">u/liberosist</a> and <a href=\"/u/pseudotheos\">u/pseudotheos</a> on the subject.

I've got some assets farming on Badger and Convex right now including CRV. I think CRV is the OG LDR token and is one of the first genuinely confusing things people will come across in Defi. Your first impression of CRV issuance is probably that bribes are bad, issuance is bad, and Curve must therefore be bad. Follow the revenue and incentive flows though and they have made a crazy amount of partnerships and integrations because of their issuance. Also, few people actually understand Curve v2 pools. Everyone still thinks of Curve as a place only for like-kind assets even though the Tricrypto pool has been out for a long time now. I like the Curve v2 model of liquidity management better than Univ3. I expect Alchemix v2 to add various 3crv assets as collateral to their vaults sometime this year which will be a glorious leg up for all of Defi. Overall, there are big changes afoot and DAOs will either adapt to these new models of liquidity sourcing or die a slow price death of inflation perhaps accelerated by a bear market. Adapt or die.

I&#39;ve got some assets farming on Badger and Convex right now including CRV. I think CRV is the OG LDR token and is one of the first genuinely confusing things people will come across in Defi. Your first impression of CRV issuance is probably that bribes are bad, issuance is bad, and Curve must therefore be bad. Follow the revenue and incentive flows though and they have made a crazy amount of partnerships and integrations because of their issuance. Also, few people actually understand Curve v2 pools. Everyone still thinks of Curve as a place only for like-kind assets even though the Tricrypto pool has been out for a long time now. I like the Curve v2 model of liquidity management better than Univ3.

If they were a prime example they would be speaking up against the police brutality that has been occurring in Canada, but that brutality is mainly against whites, so it doesn\u2019t suit the narrative that police brutality may actually be a problem independent of race.</p>\n\n<p>The money printer - this goes back to my view on the Fed and how it is a private bank with private investors and how it\u2019s creation was unconstitutional and done behind closed doors. In one year we printed more money into circulation than the last 300 years combined. And for what? Is not the damage from that, the disruption in the supply chain/ the amount of small business closings/ the increase in domestic violence/drug abuse/ suicides/ mental health issues outweigh what we now know to be a disease which over 99.5% of people under 60 with less than 3 comorbidities will survive?</p>\n\n<p>Now Ukraine and Russia - this to me just seems to be the next event that is timed perfectly so as to keep people in a state of fear panic alert stress. Why does there have to be a threat of world war imminent? Previous world wars have been shown to have powerful interest brokering and profiting from both sides so why would we believe this time to be any different?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-24 19:06:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hybzpoh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_t03int","parent_id":"t1_hybaeb9","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"Thank you for writing this up.
