This means ZK-rollups post data on the layer one blockchain itself while Validiums post validity proofs on-chain, but the data remain on a separate network. This enables Validium to achieve considerably higher throughput than ZKRU or ORs. By sending data off-chain rather than on-chain, it reduces the cost of each transaction and increases the transactions per second (TPS).  \nBy keeping data off-chain, Validiums also offer privacy benefits as users\u2019 transaction and balance information is stored with the validium operator instead of publicly on the blockchain. However, because transaction data is not published on-chain, users are forced to trust an operator to make the data available when needed. This key difference makes Validiums more akin to a highly performant, custodial PoA system where Validium operators could freeze, but not steal, users' funds.  \nThe trade-off for storing data off-chain is that it requires trust in the third party who could prevent users from accessing their balances. Starkware aims to solve this with a Data Availability Committee (DAC), a committee of 8 independent members that have their own copy of the transactions made.
