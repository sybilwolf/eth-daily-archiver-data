There was big buying at the current bottom and all markets are back at their resistance downtrend lines with positive daily momentum. BTC's actually above its downtrend line again by a bit.

Every test has been passed.\n\nBut there's reason for caution as always.\n\nBear cases where I'd urge caution a while longer.\n\n* BTC - monthly momentum is still severely bearish but it *does* have the potential to turn up. And keep an open mind as you're unlikely to spy a bottom on a monthly chart. Obviously they're great for long-term investors to feel more confidence, but we can absolutely bottom with a bearish monthly chart. However, BTC has stung down below the 20 Month MA twice this year and in its history has never gone forward without another drop down to the 50 Week MA. Past doesn't equal future, but it's a guard rail.\n* SPY, QQQ, DIA, IWM... when the market wakes up tomorrow, they will have printed their first monthly momentum lines below bearish levels since realistically Feb 2019. Yes, they dipped there in April 2020 but we all know how and why it was short-lived. Bearish prints don't mean a drop necessarily -- they're trailing indicators -- but it does make for serious headwind.\n* Volatility\n   * VIX? Still above 30 even after the past 72 trading hours of miraculous rescues\n   * VXN (Nasdaq)? Even worse above 32\n   * RVX (Russell)? Even worse above 34\n   * There is a lot of fear still in the markets to be tempered. And it will be tempered; volatility doesn't last long. The question is what has to happen first, a slow recovery or a face-ripping meltdown?\n   * Recall there is *still* a gap way up at 45 on the VIX from the Covid crash. It *can* go ripping sky high if it needs to for a shake out. We'd likely get an early warning sign in the form of a daily close or two above 32 for the VIX, which it has yet to do.\n* Seasonality: March is the worst-performing month for growth stocks and tech, which we tend to but don't always follow.\n   * When BTC is above its 20 Week average, ETH actually enjoys March quite a bit. But BTC is below currently and ETH didn't like that in 2018\n   * Additionally, it's a midterm election year for the U.S. and Q1 of a midterm year is historically rough, sometimes bleeding into Q2. A strong recovery tends to succeed Q1 however.\n* Fed rate hikes: We're all tired of hearing about it and come March 16 we'll get to hear it a little less. The Fed will raise rates at least 25 bps. It could raise them 50 bps. Or higher, though that's unlikely. Generally, though, the market is extremely poor at pricing in rate hikes and so while everyone expects 25 bps, the Fed tends to go higher. There could be volatility leading up to the 16th and backlash in the early days after the announcement before it digests and turns around.\n\nOverall, I just want folks to be careful as even when crypto bucks a trend, it can only do so for so long. We are closer to risk-off than risk-on. We are closer to markets rolling over than not. If we make it through March unscathed with some strong, supportive weekly closes to undo the monthly bearishness, we could be in for an exciting next three quarters .\n\nPersonally? I'm sitting in spot, ready to get a confirmation upward in a few weeks but also prepared for a ridiculous dump in the first half of March.\n\nThere's so much more to discuss so feel free to bring up any topics or sectors in replies!\n\nCheers!\n\nedit: i forgot someone wanted to talk the dollar DXY.
