I wanted to give some more visibility to his post so we can try and get some more traction on this. \n\nThe HodlerCon Event has a number of moving parts and has been the work of a small number of dedicated individuals to help make our event fun, memorable and convenient to book. As discussed in the post we have some needs/wants as we get closer to the dates of the event.\nWe are planning on trying to attempt to \"breakoff\" into a few different \"sub-committees of need\" now that general planning is humming along nicely and wrapping up.\n\nSome of the needs/wants we are looking at are within the following topics:\n\nMarketing & Social Networking Committee\n\nNFT & Poap Planning & Builders Committee run by -@woh in HodlerCon Discord\n\nCorporate Sponsorship Planning Committee run by myself\n\nWe also have an Event Planning Committee run by /u/doubtstarsarefire \n(Part 2, stupid discord char limit)\nSome details surrounding these committees of the needs:\n\nMSNC - The biggest need is for someone to take up the torch of managing the twitter account and other social media that we have for Hodlcon. (@HodlerCon, help us out with a follow on Twitter!)\n\nNFTPoapPBC - The biggest need we have is for those who know the creation process and have ideas on how to raise additional funding through these methods and to help create ideas on how we can make Hodlercon even more memorable through NFTS and Poaps that we want to distribute during the event.\n\nCSPC - We are in talks already with some corporate sponsors and swag opportunities and have garnered a lot of interest in making more official sponsorship plans. We are thinking about adding some rewards and tiers of corporate sponsorship to some of the planned events and so we want some people who want to help network and build out some relationships to see if others might want to get involved.\n\nEPC - DoubtStars has already made amazing progress here and has done soooo much fantastic work but if you're interested in helping out how you can I'm sure she wouldn't turn it down!\n\nPlease if you have time or knowledge surrounding these topics or just want to get involved please reach out to myself via DMs or hit us up in the Discord! (*discord is best for coordination)\n\nWe want to make this trip memorable and fun but it takes coordination and help. Any help you can give would be so awesome, there is some whispers and murmurs about a Hodlercon volunteer Poap as well.\n\nLastly, please don't feel too overwhelmed by these items, even if you don't know anything about them and just have an hour a week to spare we'd love for your help! Honestly if we had a lot of people volunteer collectively we could make really short work of all of this, so please show how much you care about this community and what we stand for by signing up for something if you are able.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey Everyone,</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday we had a post in the daily from <a href=\"/u/Childsp\">/u/Childsp</a> asking for volunteers for some sub-committees that we are creating for the HodlerCon event.
