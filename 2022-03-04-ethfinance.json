And said if you can bring me a solution, I&#39;d be really open to try.</p>\n\n<p>Clever guy, asking me to do the work. But he seemed very motivated, so I&#39;d like to &quot;give him a solution&quot;. Not as easy as it looks - especially on the onboarding customers side. </p>\n\n<p>What does the community think is a simple way to pay dor a coffee nowadays? L2 is a must. Easy onramp and swaps to stablecoin for customers, easy offramp from stables to bank for owner.</p>\n\n<p>Argent ? Was my first thought. No seeds, safe, integrated swaps etc. </p>\n\n<p>Then a QR code on the bar? Scan and pay. How does the owner know immediately that he received the right amount? He needs to have his screen open too?</p>\n\n<p>Then, what are offramp fees from zksync to bank? Or does he go via a CEX? Are there any which accept from L2 yet? If fees are higher than the bank POS terminals (what, 2.5 % or something?) Than he has no financial incentive to change.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, can he give his crypto customers an NFT for promo&#39;s etc? Can they be seen in argent? </p>\n\n<p>Is this a lock-in to an argent ecosystem ?</p>\n\n<p>Tell me what you think! Would be great if we can together develop a one pager to give to any coffeeshop that&#39;s interested!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-03 22:13:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hzaapj2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_t6c4mp","parent_id":"t3_t6c4mp","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"The easiest way is to just use an exchange deposit address.

I was hoping to try out a [never sell method](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-never-sell-plan?s=r) for fun to pay the taxman this year, but not quite going as planned. Writing up my thoughts here both for feedback and just to prompt discussion since it's a cool application of defi.\n\nFirst, are there really still no major lending platforms that accept rETH as collateral? Seems I was overly optimistic about something like MakerDAO adding it as a collateral option so soon. I know they're still waiting for more market cap and time-tested smart contract soundness, and I can't blame them.\n\nSecond, the bear market has highlighted an issue with going through both MakerDAO and Alchemix: overcollateralization is required at each step. If you keep a 200% collateralization ratio in MakerDAO, then with Alchemix only letting you take out 50% of deposited Dai as alUSD, that means you wind up with only 1/4 of your initial deposit as usable capital. And that just won't cut it for my tax bill (may have locked up a bit too much ETH in staking).\n\nTo be clear, I'm definitely able to afford my taxes, the question is just what's the best and most interesting way to do so. In hindsight, I should have immediately cashed out enough ETH to pay taxes when I realized gains and just left that sitting as stables for a few months. I can still cash out now, though obviously at a lower price. But I didn't want to sell then, and I definitely don't want to sell now.\n\nSo what's the plan? I'm thinking for the moment I swap my rETH back to ETH (capital loss at least) and drop it into Liquity via DeFi Saver, sell LUSD to pay Uncle Sam. Maintain Liquity above 160% collateralization, aiming to easily avoid liquidation down to ETH prices around $1500. If ETH price goes up, do some flash loan shenanigans to add Alchemix back into the mix. If rETH becomes accepted collateral somewhere trusted, do some flash loan shenanigans to switch the collateral back over.\n\nIt's a little risky, especially in a bear market. But even if the bottom of the market is still a ways out, the merge may also help out since I have a significant amount locked up in staking. Could direct my earned tips/MEV to bumping up collateral if needed.\n\nThoughts?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s tax time for me (USA).
