Answering your questions in order:\n\n1. You can deposit into the LP with either asset. Curve will balance each after deposit automatically.

APR is received in \"base apy\" and \"rewards apr.\" This is where curve works a little differently than Uniswap, and this can actually get super complicated, so I will sum it up thusly: ignore base apy. All you should care about with Curve LP's is the Rewards APR, i.e. the extra CRV or other tokens the pool rewards you.

There's gonna be countless FUD revolving around this, tons of misunderstanding about how \"The Elites at the Ethereum Foundation generated this setup and can use the secret string to rugpull you at any time\". I mean, regardless of [the actual complex cryptography behind it](https://i.imgur.com/WlIwMiv.png), it's still something called a \"trusted setup\" being integrated in something that's supposed to be trustless. There will be a financial incentive for many to willfully misunderstand it and blow this \"trusted\" bit way out of proportion and imply that it's a weak link in Ethereum's architecture.\n\nAnyway I digress. I hope (expect) such a browser-based tool to be an integral part of the trusted setup ceremony, and the best way you can help (and I mean *you* specifically as in the person reading this comment) will be to participate in it and help minimize the trust assumption: Generate a random value, do the cryptography thingy on the browser-based tool, send it, then delete the random value you generated. Optionally keep the public bit (the *Common Reference String*) to later verify it's been properly included in the overall setup. And that's a bit overkill on the op-sec but still: generate the secret bit on a device that's not connected to the internet, the same way you'd generate a private key for a cold wallet.\n\nThis way, when the trusted setup-related FUD inevitably happens, the very best you can say is \"*I* participated in it and know for a fact that I was honest in deleting the secret bit\". It literally takes a single honest participant to make sure the whole setup is safe and sound and can't be abused in any way. At the very least, if you are such a honest participant, then *you* have 100% guarantee the whole setup is secure.\n\nAnd of course on the long run, not everyone using Ethereum will have participated in it nor will have had a chance to. So the second best thing we as a community will be able to do is point out the (hopefully) thousands of people who all say they participated honestly and then really drive home the point that the **only** way the trusted setup could be corrupt would be if *every single one* of the participants (again, that's *without a single exception*) not only kept the secret bit, but colluded with each other to generate fake commitments. The more people participate, the more absurd this hypothetical becomes and the more ridiculous the person fudding the trusted setup will look.

Factoria seemed the most open source and aligned with my goals. If you know Javascript their skinnerbox is also great. It&#39;s a very powerful tool.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind the generative art part is separate from the mint or anything like that. I used a python script to combine my drawn procreate layers and create metadata from this tutorial, it includes Metadata creation with rarities which is nice if your art has rarity attributes:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/scrappy-squirrels/tutorial-create-generative-nft-art-with-rarities-8ee6ce843133\">https://medium.com/scrappy-squirrels/tutorial-create-generative-nft-art-with-rarities-8ee6ce843133</a></p>\n\n<p>My website is literally just a button with a link to the factoria mint page.

With the sell of a physical piece of art they are considering to include an NFT as the certificate of authenticity. Currently they do this with a piece of paper, a fancy piece of paper but a piece of paper in the end. \n\nI guess the idea would be to include the metadata that typically comes included in the physical piece of paper (author, name of the piece of art, year it was created, picture of the piece...) in the NFT metadata. To be noted that they don't sell the NFT, they sell art in its physical form.

I think the sweet spot could be achieved if they are willing to hire someone to build a custom solution for them. Deploy an OpenZeppelin contract implementing ERC-721 (perhaps also over an L2). And a custom built UI that enables them to introduce the right inputs for the metadata of each piece of art (applying some checks and safeguarding for possible user mistakes like double minting). But, of course, this could be more expensive.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I presume they would mint the token and then include it with the sale, correct?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Correct. With the sell of a physical piece of art they are considering to include an NFT as the certificate of authenticity. Currently they do this with a piece of paper, a fancy piece of paper but a piece of paper in the end. </p>\n\n<p>I guess the idea would be to include the metadata that typically comes included in the physical piece of paper (author, name of the piece of art, year it was created, picture of the piece...) in the NFT metadata. To be noted that they don&#39;t sell the NFT, they sell art in its physical form. The NFT would just come with the art piece as a tamper-proof and unforgeable proof of authenticity.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For kind of a one stop shop they could try Rarible, which is a decentralized NFT marketplace that let&#39;s users mint individual tokens or tokens as part of a collection. Then transfering to customers can all be done via the Rarible UI. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Very interesting, this could fit the bill from what you describe. Will look more into it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think Superrare also does mints but I don&#39;t know much about them at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Will look into them too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m unaware of any platform that abstracts away even using MM or paying gas. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible but you&#39;d have to code it yourself I imagine. Factoria.app has a &quot;skinnerbox&quot; Javascript implementation that can let people do some pretty cool stuff but you need to know javascript.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would like to give them an honest review of the space, perhaps it&#39;s still a bit early days and not exactly ready for mainstream adoption. I think the sweet spot could be achieved if they are willing to hire someone to build a custom solution for them. Deploy an OpenZeppelin contract implementing ERC-721 (perhaps also over an L2). And a custom built UI that enables them to introduce the right inputs for the metadata of each piece of art (applying some checks and safeguarding for possible user mistakes like double minting). But, of course, this could be more expensive.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-07 04:25:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hzp2act","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_t72xkr","parent_id":"t1_hzn7gai","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/illram","body":"Yeah I agree with your last point.
