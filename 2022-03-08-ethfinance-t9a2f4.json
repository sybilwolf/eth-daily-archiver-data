Maker is pretty crazy as well describing it as a decentralized central bank is more mindblowing than just saying you can borrow money permissonlessly.</p>\n\n<p>I think for someone who isn&#39;t in to finance the best things to sell them on are pool together(no loss lotteries) because people love seeing they can win a lottery while getting yield and not having to pay for a ticket(if they actually win one they are hooked on crypto for life guaranteed). If not that then some stablecoin yield (especially something where it is constant accruing interest or daily interest) people who don&#39;t know anything about finance completely change their mind when they see a safe stable USD amount going up every single day at a noticeable rate. It hits very different than the 1 cent they get every month from their savings account.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-08 14:10:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hzw8u01","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_t9a2f4","parent_id":"t1_hzvp1eo","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TenFootMouse","body":"Smart contracts explained correctly should flip any non believer.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Smart contracts explained correctly should flip any non believer.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-08 15:31:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hzwjyc2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_t9a2f4","parent_id":"t1_hzw8u01","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Upside_Down-Bot","body":"\u201e\u02d9\u0279\u01dd\u028c\u01dd\u0131l\u01ddq uou \u028eu\u0250 d\u0131l\u025f plno\u0265s \u028el\u0287\u0254\u01dd\u0279\u0279o\u0254 p\u01ddu\u0131\u0250ldx\u01dd s\u0287\u0254\u0250\u0279\u0287uo\u0254 \u0287\u0279\u0250\u026fS\u201e","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u201e\u02d9\u0279\u01dd\u028c\u01dd\u0131l\u01ddq uou \u028eu\u0250 d\u0131l\u025f plno\u0265s \u028el\u0287\u0254\u01dd\u0279\u0279o\u0254 p\u01ddu\u0131\u0250ldx\u01dd s\u0287\u0254\u0250\u0279\u0287uo\u0254 \u0287\u0279\u0250\u026fS\u201e</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-08 15:32:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hzwjzd9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_t9a2f4","parent_id":"t1_hzwjyc2","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/asdafari","body":"Maker vaults were the game changer for me.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Maker vaults were the game changer for me.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-08 12:10:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hzvr1hi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_t9a2f4","parent_id":"t1_hzvp1eo","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Mountainminer","body":"Thanks!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-08 13:01:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hzvz2tc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_t9a2f4","parent_id":"t1_hzvr1hi","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Eddie_Eddie","body":"I'm also working on something related - a campaign to draw attention to the most social/economic impactful projects. \n\nBeyond specific projects, some of which have been named here, Ethereum and web3 are about driving power back to the users.

The best thing we as a community can do is encourage those services to at least diversify their clients, which is what's happening.\n\nAfter that my best bet for what should be pushed toward to (hopefully significantly) decrease the share of centralized staking:\n\n* Social side: Make people understand the harm for the network (and thus their stake's value) if they prioritize the convenience of centralized staking services. This currently amounts to spreading the RocketPool gospel.\n\n* Economics side: Make big money understand decentralized solutions *should* outperform centralized ones and are the safer bets. It takes just one big Coinbase fuckup (or government-mandated fuckup) for slashing penalties to scale super harshly and lose a bunch of people's money \u2013 much harder to do when the fuckup needs to be coordinated against thousands of independant Rocket Pool node operators who don't know each other.\n\n* Technological side: Abstraction abstraction abstraction. Combine any of the followings together:\n\n  * More decentralized staking stuff. Rocket Pool is the first but not the last. Hopefully Lido decentralizes like they promise. Then more solutions will pop up and then throw some more abstractions on top of them to spread out the individual and network risk.\n\n  * Lower the tech skills/knowlege required to stake. Already something rocket pool does super well, and will continue to get better with simpler GUIs. \n\n  * Better scaling (duh), better light clients, better UX (smart wallets), etc. Make the one-click convenience of participating in staking via rETH as easy if not easier as Coinbase or Kraken. I'd personally love some UI that abstracts away rETH entirely and just shows an increasing ETH balance. Super easy to do under the hood so the user doesn't even have to know about rETH.\n\n  * Lower the economic cost of participating in staking directly.

Permissionless access to full staking with the same APR as a full validator but on small amounts would be the holy grail IMO.\n\nWe're still early\u2122 and all the pieces have yet to come together the way I'm trying to portray, but individually they're all work in progress or high up on various roadmaps.
