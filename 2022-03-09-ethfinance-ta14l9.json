The node operators stake at least 15 POKT per node and earn .0089 POKT for every relay they are randomly selected to provide, which incentivises running lots of nodes.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like the more demand for data POKT network gets from dapps, the more POKT is bought and staked and the more lucrative running a node becomes, causing more 15 POKT stakes for new nodes. With more data relays for which nodes are paid, comes higher issuance: the token is inflationary but has a burning mechanism in which the network&#39;s customers - those requesting data from POKT nodes - is burned.</p>\n\n<p>Given peoples&#39; growing knowledge of infura&#39;s centralization and how little I see this network talked about, it seems like a good buy on the face of it.

I think you hit the head on the nail about China. Unlike when the US overtook the UK, the Chinese are not in a better place than us. Their debt to GDP ratio is higher, their reliance on global markets is higher, to heir currency is weaker, their institutions are weaker, the heir military is far weaker, and we are still not competing on most high end products. \n\nI think a change in the world order is happening but not the US passing the mantle to China. It seems more like a lot of countries are headed for default and in the wake of that a new Bretton Woods type agreement will occur. I think to he biggest loss for the US is that we will lose a lot of our sanctioning power. I think this will happen by an agreement to price international transactions based on a currency backed by a basket of commodities Whatever new institutions form will govern what goes in the basket.  This benefits the illiberal players seeking change (China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, etc) and benefits resource rich developing nations like Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria, Indonesia, etc. \n\nfrom there I see the world fragmenting into different blocs, a western one, a Russian one, a Chinese one, an Indian one, ASEAN, the middle east, and Africa. Each of these blocs is going to either go Blockchain or fully manages government central currency. I for see the west, Africa and the middle east going Blockchain and everyone else going centralized. ASEAN is a wild card.

I think you hit the head on the nail about China. Unlike when the US overtook the UK, the Chinese are not in a better place than us. Their debt to GDP ratio is higher, their reliance on global markets is higher, to heir currency is weaker, their institutions are weaker, the heir military is far weaker, and we are still not competing on most high end products. </p>\n\n<p>I think a change in the world order is happening but not the US passing the mantle to China. It seems more like a lot of countries are headed for default and in the wake of that a new Bretton Woods type agreement will occur. I think to he biggest loss for the US is that we will lose a lot of our sanctioning power. I think this will happen by an agreement to price international transactions based on a currency backed by a basket of commodities Whatever new institutions form will govern what goes in the basket.  This benefits the illiberal players seeking change (China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, etc) and benefits resource rich developing nations like Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria, Indonesia, etc. </p>\n\n<p>from there I see the world fragmenting into different blocs, a western one, a Russian one, a Chinese one, an Indian one, ASEAN, the middle east, and Africa.

Have had it continuously for the last hour despite changing all recommended settings etc (I&#39;m trying to withdraw liquidity from a pool into ETH in one single transaction - one of the most useful Zapper features - usually works flawlessly): </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Try reloading the page or logging out then reconnecting your wallet. Reach out to us if this persists. You can also try increasing the slippage.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I can sign the approval transaction but when I hit &quot;Confirm&quot; that comes up. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any other dApp that lets you do the same thing?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: It suddenly worked for one pool for no apparent reason after many tries. But then gave the same error when trying to do the same thing on a second pool..</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: I figured it out. It worked miraculously because my Ledger had gone to sleep while I was waiting and then Zapper gave me an error message saying &quot;Some hardware wallets don&#39;t support signed approvals, you will need to do an approval confirmation transaction&quot;. Then I had a different button saying &quot;approve&quot; instead of &quot;sign transaction&quot; and when I hit that, Metamask popped up properly and it worked perfectly with the Ledger (after I woke it up). So appears to be some issue with the Ledger not supporting the approvals..</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-09 12:04:57","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-03-09 12:45:00","id":"i00ivzo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ta14l9","parent_id":"t3_ta14l9","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Tomr750","body":"what is the likely impact of the fed money printer stopping today?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>what is the likely impact of the fed money printer stopping today?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-09 19:11:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i027jwy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ta14l9","parent_id":"t3_ta14l9","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/behind245","body":"Did they get PC Load Letter?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Did they get PC Load Letter?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-09 20:05:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i02e6as","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ta14l9","parent_id":"t1_i027jwy","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/maotsetunginmyass","body":"The fuck does that mean?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The fuck does that mean?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-09 21:16:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i02lvr9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ta14l9","parent_id":"t1_i02e6as","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Sir, this is a Chachkies.

Someone who&#39;s priced out of Ethereum&#39;s L1 and goes to an EVM sidechain is a net loss for Ethereum (at least in terms of opportunity costs) but if they go to an L2 then Ethereum gets that fee revenue, albeit more indirectly. </p>\n\n<p>And L1 is not gonna go out of usage any time soon, it&#39;s still the most secure layer to move big money and settle high value stuff and (currently) has the deepest liquidity, so if L1 fees go down there&#39;s gonna more reasons to use L1 over L2 for the people priorizing security.
