It&#39;s just a flesh wound, we all know the market is wrong, it will all bounce and we&#39;ll have a glorious bull just a few months later...despite continuous lower highs and lower lows over several quarters, and despite capital clearly leaving the system from its q4 &#39;17 heydays.</p>\n\n<p>Of course Ethereum isn&#39;t a shitcoin, IMO it has the higher risk adjusted reward in all of crypto, the merge and the resulting supply shock is unprecedented, and the crypto industry has far more persistent use cases than it could have imagined in &#39;17. And yet, it&#39;s also true we had nearly 18 months of bull run after bull in crypto, and nearly 15 years of a never ending bullrun in equities. No matter the fundamentals, I think any asset class has a chance of getting rinsed in the coming months</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-10 15:24:55","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-03-10 16:50:56","id":"i06799r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tarzxd","parent_id":"t1_i04r07p","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/NeedlerOP","body":"Eh, bears are wrong 19 times and right once \n\nWho's to say this isn't the start of Crypto winter^(TM)   ^(:/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Eh, bears are wrong 19 times and right once </p>\n\n<p>Who&#39;s to say this isn&#39;t the start of Crypto winter<sup>TM</sup>   <sup>:/</sup></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-10 10:35:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i04zyrv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tarzxd","parent_id":"t1_i04r07p","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"Oh so very true!

Well, as it turned out, that was the right call. Fewer may recall all of the people on the way down from the 2017/2018 top who kept buying (that was me too), and those who ultimately capitulated at the bottom between December 2018 and March 2020 (thankfully, that wasn't me).\n\nIt's likely too early to definitely say that we are in a down-trending bear market. But the data that we do have are 1) we have exhausted the time for a typical 4 year cycle in crypto, 2) we had what could be considered a \"top,\" though not a blow-off one unless you consider we bottomed at $90 and went up 5300% in about a year, and 3) crypto still appears to be a risk asset and the macro environment for risk looks like shit.\n\nThe fact that we didn't see our typical reflexive blow-off top could just mean crypto is now so big that this kind of reflexivity is not possible in the system for assets like ETH and BTC, or alternatively that the covid-dump in March 2020 created an unexpected low of a significant magnitude which led to an earlier sell off because sufficient supply was in the hands of those who could sell that effective double-top at at $4900 and still profit handsomely.\n\nGoing back to posts even fewer people may remember, it was probably around Fall 2018 (can't remember when exactly, but ETH was about $300 to $400), but on ethtrader I said something to the effect of \"if you are still here at this point, you need to be here for the long-haul, because the near-term looks uncertain, but the long-term looks incredible.\" I had then accepted that we were in a prevailing bearish trend. I feel we may be on the cusp of that phase now.\n\nRealistically, I don't see a lot of reason to believe we resume \"up only\" tomorrow and take out new all-time highs on the road to $10K and beyond. Did I hope we'd get there this cycle? Yes, but so far, it hasn't been in the cards. Conversely, it may also mean we don't see the kind of decline we've seen in cycles past either since we didn't have that blowoff top. So maybe we're in this mostly sideways structure, maybe ETH retests its 2017/2018 high, I don't know.\n\nI will say I think the narratives of the eth2 merge happening and bull market turning back on are possibly misplaced. I'm super excited about the merge, and it'll be a turning point in this technology, but beyond an issuance reduction, it will not bring a lot of evident fundamental network improvements for most users. What we really need to get there are L2s which absorb a critical mass of use, bridges which help connect them with each other, and we need the superior UX they can help provide.\n\nSo how am I playing these markets? Well, I hold a lot of ETH. Much more than I did through the last bear market, and I hold quite a few NFTs which are denominated in ETH (stuff I like and I believe is long-term heirloom quality). I haven't sold a single one through multiple NFT market tops. But I also hold a lot of cash, because in this macro environment (not just crypto), I just feel more secure with some cash (and of course to pay taxes). If we see a nice bottom in a prolonged bear, I'll be buying. If we don't, then I have cash runway to make sure I can keep putting ramen on the table for a while.\n\nIn my humble opinion, I don't think now is a time to take excessive risk. Now is a time to make sure you've taken survivable risk and can live to fight another day. Now is the time to make sure you are still here to see the next bull market. I don't want to get into debates on if we're in a \"super cycle,\", or if eth2 will save the day, or if the eventual unlock of ETH on eth2 will lead to a sell-off (though it probably will, it'll be a one-time event). All of these things are possible, and it is also possible that they are all mostly irrelevant in the face of prevailing reflexive market conditions. In a bull market, people want to keep taking risk because the price is going up. In a bear, people want to keep selling, because they are scared that the price is going down. It's really hard to fight a trend once it becomes clear (arguably it hasn't yet), even with fundamentals.\n\nRegardless, I will tell you one thing, which many others here could tell you too: the real fortunes are made in a bear market, when no one else wants to buy, because they don't believe in the tech, because they don't understand it. I kept buying through the last bear, and it changed my life. Regardless of whether we are in a bullish period still or a bearish one, you can use this time to position yourself for the epic arc of cryptocurrency that is still unfolding. Study, learn, engage, invest strategically. Whether you capitulate at a bottom will be your call and no one else's.\n\n\ud83d\udd96","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Many here may remember my bullish fundamentals posts, a lot of them towards the bottom of the last cycle, where I urged folks to take a longer term view on these markets and on this technology.

StarkWare has already stated that they will eventually have a token, and while their is some concerns that some protocols will look to \"double dip\" (have both a token and traditional equity), no one has done this yet for good reason. It would definitely raise red flags for both crypto natives and regulators to structure your organization in that way.

I would also note that while every different token distribution model has its flaws, this definitely isn't a new \"normal\" for crypto companies to operate with this model, and token distribution arguably used to be much worse...\n\nRemember back in 2017, pretty much every coin was selling an ICO to retail + keeping a huge stack on the side for future operations that they would slowly dump on retail. While that huge stack on the side is still there, at least coins are now more fairly distributed to early adopters and/or actual users of the protocol via liquidity incentives (vs being sold at ICO). Yes, at the end of the day, teams do sell their own supply to facilitate operations, and this leads to a lot of problems with poorly designed incentives and coins getting dumped on retail buyers. Still, I do think we've made a lot of progress in making the distribution models more aligned with long term interests of users, holders, and developers alike with innovations like veTokenomics, DAO/protocol owned liquidity and more. \n\nI would just close by noting that there's obviously still a ton of room for improvement in this space and a myriad of complex problems (with some being worse than others ofc), but the biggest problem of all is probably simply low float tokens are frequently grossly overpriced. This happens because retail tends to get way over excited about new tech and notices tokens pumping like crazy, and not pay as much attention to lock-ups and FDV of some of these assets. Most teams are complete upfront about the fact that a ton of supply is yet to hit the market, but retail tends to ignore this dynamic, and ends up getting dumped on as tokens are vested. Before investing in any new token you really need to pay close attention to it's fully diluted value and future issuance schedule.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>investors expect to get value back, is it through shares, earning %s or future tokens?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Almost certainly through % of future tokens. StarkWare has already stated that they will eventually have a token, and while their is some concerns that some protocols will look to &quot;double dip&quot; (have both a token and traditional equity), no one has done this yet for good reason. It would definitely raise red flags for both crypto natives and regulators to structure your organization in that way.

It's probably best if you get the website either from a link from coingecko or from their Discord resources page.\n\nAfter that before doing crypto work I usually check all my Discord news sources. It's rare that you're the first person getting scammed so if there has been some recent announcement I like to check that in case it steers me away from doing something on that platform. If you are new enough to be asking about basic security still, it's not worth aping into something the second it goes live.\n\nIs this your first time doing this thing? What else is in that wallet you're about to sign on? Could you be approving an asset you aren't intending? People can't pull your ETH but they can pull all your USDC for example just by getting you to sign an approve message you shouldn't have. Basic wallet hygiene and trial runs have saved professionals their life savings. I recently read about a guy that was saved from someone that had joined his DAO recently that wanted him to approve an NFT for some other project but actually was trying to get him to approve a major Aave LP token. What saved him was he transferred the NFT to a tiny wallet first as a matter of basic hygiene.\n\nIf you are skeptical of a contract, one thing you can do is check the owner address of the contract on Etherscan. Many contracts have OwnerOnly functions that assist with setting up a contract before they free it (set owner to 0x0...). If you aren't expecting an owner and you see one, it might be worth having a look at the other write function names on the contract. Sometimes hacks are very transparent, they just want you to blindly sign a transaction and don't expect you to look here at all.\n\n> What are best practices (\"the best procedure\" or \"steps to follow\") before signing with your crypto wallet? (for users who don't have hardware)\n\nBest practices include having a hardware wallet. If you have enough to be using Ethereum main net at all, you should have a hardware wallet. It should probably take you at least an hour to be able to recover your private key. In that hour, you should think carefully about whether you are potentially being scammed. Before signing with your wallet, how complex is this transaction? Is the gas fee about what you expect? Something double or triple what you expect indicates the contract is doing something you aren't expecting. You'll calibrate your expectations with time.\n\nBtw JT, this is something I was writing about anyway if you want to collab a piece with Grid.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>What should people be on the lookout for before signing to approve a website like OpenSea, UniSwap, Decentraland, etc. (think in terms of general red flags)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you got to the website from a google search, definitely double check the url.
