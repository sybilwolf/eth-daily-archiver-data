I think /u/darkestchaos gets so much hate these days on Ethfinance on his [top level video posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/tbkg2v/live_why_i_think_ethereum_is_about_to_explode/).   We don't get a lot of front page content, and when he posts, he almost always gets buried in downvotes and negativity.  He's not producing negative opinion pieces or vaguely veiled endorsed bullshit.\n\nWe don't get a lot of Youtubers because frankly, most of them are really trash spam and they get hammered for not being contributors outside of spamming their videos.  \n\nOmar doesn't have to be your cup of tea, but he might be someone else's. Don't piss in the kettle please.\n\nOmar....maybe shares once a month when it is something he knows is suitable for Ethfinance.  He never overposts.\n\nHe's probably the least sponsored Youtuber I've ever seen and he's been in it for the tech more than just about anyone on crypto YouTube.\n\nOmar has been here since Ethtrader and even in Ethfinance....and when he posts, he's getting literal trolls in Ethfinance coming out of the woods I had no idea were here.  I just don't know why he bothers coming here....but he does, because *he's also a member here outside his YT channel*.  \n\nGive him an upvote from time to time....and for the love of all that is good, don't troll the guy (or others when it's not warranted.)  He's a  nice person just expressing his opinion and I've never seen him have a negative tongue to anyone ever in his videos.

Anyway, here\u2019s the two points\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Is a recession really looking unlikely at the moment, and which data suggest that? To me almost everything is pointing towards recession, commodities rocketing and no long term good news available for grain/oil/gas, inflation 40y highs, rates rising (more below), consumer spending ready to snap back to basics as wage growth fails to keep up with inflation and costs. I dare not look at risks of corporate or retail defaults, lots of debt there taken out in relatively good times and at low low rates. </p>\n\n<p>On the FOMC next week, how likely are they to surprise the market with a smaller rate hike or no hike at all, and would it have much of an impact anyway? They\u2019ve been extremely cautious not to surprise the market with hikes both in frequency and scale, I don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t they apply the same caution in the other direction. Seem that a hike between 0.25% and 0.75% is somewhat priced in, would a smaller hike of ~0.1% or no hike be likely or make much of a difference?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-11 04:41:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i08f85a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tbjcm9","parent_id":"t1_i082qxq","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"Recessions you gotta be EXTREMELY careful with how you think.

Safer to hold reth? Arguably yes because there is less assumed smart contract risk. Better from a return standpoint? No way. The convex pool is a nifty money Lego that you can plug in rETH to and is something that you may want to add to your strategy. \n\nYou need to deposit to the curve rETH/wstETH first in curve.fi. Keep in mind that the ideal ratio of reth to wstETH is NOT what curve thinks it is (it\u2019s NOT supposed to be 50/50. Its ideal is 77/23 I believe). So when you go to deposit your reth be aware that the \u2018penalty\u2019 for supplying an asset in excess probably isn\u2019t correct. Curve needs to tweak their UI to solve that. \n\nOnce you have deposited to curve (deposit only. NOT add to gauge) then head over to convex, find the rETH/wsteth pool and deposit the LP token you just received from curve. It\u2019s a multiple step process to get this done, so be aware that when you want to withdraw in the future it\u2019ll be eth gas fee dependent. Use a decent amount of rETH to make it worth it.

Safer to hold reth? Arguably yes because there is less assumed smart contract risk. Better from a return standpoint? No way. The convex pool is a nifty money Lego that you can plug in rETH to and is something that you may want to add to your strategy. </p>\n\n<p>You need to deposit to the curve rETH/wstETH first in curve.fi. Keep in mind that the ideal ratio of reth to wstETH is NOT what curve thinks it is (it\u2019s NOT supposed to be 50/50. Its ideal is 77/23 I believe). So when you go to deposit your reth be aware that the \u2018penalty\u2019 for supplying an asset in excess probably isn\u2019t correct. Curve needs to tweak their UI to solve that. </p>\n\n<p>Once you have deposited to curve (deposit only.

I know there are a bunch of other things people are doing with rETH to earn more on other platforms but i&#39;m way to casual and uninformed for that and I&#39;ve learned from LP&#39;s that i don&#39;t belong in those spaces.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-11 18:06:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i0bje0g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tbjcm9","parent_id":"t3_tbjcm9","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/domotheus","body":"> If I stake ETH for rETH, there is a compounding APR of 4.33%. \n\nIt doesn't currently compound, and with node operator commission consistently at 20% the APR is closer to 4% these days\n\nIt's ETH-denominated yield so a safe 3-5% yield is pretty much what you can expect on the long term after the post-merge APR bump dries up.

First off the problem isn't a matter of scaling, it's a matter of security budget. Ethereum has a sustainable security budget. Bitcoin does not. It's not just a matter of PoW vs PoS either. Even with PoS a 21M hard cap is doomed.\n\nImagine there is a gold vault and the only time the security guards are paid is when someone comes into or leaves the vault. The more gold in the vault, the bigger it is, the larger the perimeter the security guards have to patrol. As the years go by the fees stagnate relative to the value of the gold in the vault. Eventually there isn't enough money in the fees to hire guards to watch the entire perimeter. So naturally, someone eventually manages to sneak into the vault, steal some assets, and leave. It's inevitable because the fees to pay the security guards aren't reliable but the need for security is so when fees are matched with the service quality, there are deviations in the service quality until it falls under the minimum to motivate an attacker.\n\nIf instead, the security fees to the guards included a share of the assets under management, then as the need for security grows, the budget for the guards is guaranteed to grow with it. Even on a slow day when very few people are coming and going the guards can just get paid from the assets in the vault. Over time the vault can grow and shrink and the number of guards can grow and shrink with it but there's never a moment when there's not enough to pay the guards given what is in the vault.\n\nThis is BTC with a 21M hard cap with fee based security vs ETH with perpetual issuance + EIP-1559. The perpetual issuance is the guaranteed security budget. Rather than taking assets in the vault, they mint assets and holders get an inflation tax.\n\nNext, what determines what is the legitimate chain of BTC? Whatever chain is the longest. What sets that? Hashpower. Miners. Now, L0 determines what the miners are running but in no way do BTC holders get a vote on the rules of BTC. If you want a vote you need to go sell your BTC and buy some hashpower. With ETH, ETH holders run validators and if they want to L0 and fork the chain they do get a vote. That makes ETH stakers (a form of holder) a governance entity of the Ethereum chain.\n\nNow I'm not saying miners have nothing to lose by mismanaging BTC. They have large infrastructure which is only valuable so long as BTC is. That makes them guardians with incentive alignment to protect the health of the network. But there is a large class of participants with no systemic governance power other than the buy and sell button on centralized exchanges. Will they be able to fork the network to add in sustainable security? It's not technically impossible. Will they? I doubt it until something like a double spend attack successfully occurs. Then what do you do? Rollback the chain? Again technically possible, not very feasible.\n\nI'm not putting a time window on this. It could be in 70 years and it could go to $1M per Bitcoin before then.
