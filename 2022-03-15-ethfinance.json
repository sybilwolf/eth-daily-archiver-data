An underrated asset in the Ethereum community for sure.\n\n- [CoinCentre](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1668/coin-center-is-educating-policy-makers-about-publ) - Political Lobby group for crypto. With Biden\u2019s executive order starting the discussion around fair crypto legislation in the US, we need lobbyists to finish the job and ensure that the banksters don\u2019t out lobby us and get us over-regulated.\n\n- [The Tor Project](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2805/the-tor-project) - I use Tor browser a lot to maintain privacy. I don\u2019t use it for anything nefarious, I just think it should be a human right for someone to be able to search and learn about something benign like what might be making their back sore without that data getting into the hands of discriminatory insurance companies to things much more serious like activists and journalists in countries where free speech isn\u2019t a human right. Free software has always had a funding problem and I want to promote Gitcoin as a solution to this problem even outside of crypto software.\n\n- [BasinDAO](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4197/basindao-climatenature-restoration-regeneration-c) - *Also known as the \"project developer\" DAO, basin works at the real property level creating and executing climate, nature and carbon projects with an emphasis on \"core benefits\" such as biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate justice.* I\u2019m a bit of an environmentalist at heart and I love to see the Ethereum ecosystem trying to solve some of the world\u2019s biggest problems not related to what we\u2019re solving with Ethereum itself. Plus I feel it is important that we as a community offset all of the years of wasted resources which have gone into securing Ethereum via Proof of Work.\n\n- [ResearchHub](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4698/researchhub-a-github-for-science) \u2013 A GitHub for Science - The research industry definitely needs changing as there is still tons of money made by middlemen and gatekeepers.
