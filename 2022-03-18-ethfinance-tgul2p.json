Most people have no experience taking a flash loan, would have trouble calculating how large a flash loan to take while accounting for loan fees and slippage on the alETH->ETH trade, and they aren't going to write a contract themselves to do so.\n\nThe unfortunate answer at the time was that it wasn't possible because:\n\n1) Smart contract calls were disabled and were necessary for the flash loan functionality.\n\n2) The collateralization ratio for alETH was 400%, not 200% so while the concept was sound it wasn't going to double your interest.\n\nWith the launch of Alchemix v2, both of those are no longer an issue. My plan for awhile has been to petition Furucombo and Defisaver (paging /u/nikola_j) to create combos/recipe books for Alchemix. I'm going to track down their feature request system, write something up for them, and share it here. I'd appreciate some upvotes on those features requests so they can get prioritized. However this isn't the focus of this post.\n\nRather, I've been thinking about *The Double Logris* a bit more deeply (since it's now possible) and that's led me to another thought. Forgive me for nerding out on tax law here in the US for a moment. Loan forgiveness income and short term capital gains are taxed as income. This means they pile on top of your salary when determining the tax percent you owe. For my family this is 35-37%. Now with *The Double Logris* strategy some of this income is offset by capital losses (assuming ETH price rises). However, capital losses don't offset loan forgiveness income by default. They have to be matched with capital gains, which *The Double Logris* doesn't provide. Therefore, optimizing *The Double Logris* requires you have capital gains elsewhere in your portfolio that you harvest at the end of each year to match the capital losses you calculate for the IRS. Generally, the most reliable capital gains I know of are things like Yearn vaults and cTokens. If you hold these for a year you can harvest the profit as long term capital gains at ~15% instead of 35% and match the taxes owed with the capital losses from *The Double Logris* for maximum effect. Further consideration of this phenomenon though has led to an evolution of *The Double Logris*.\n\nI'd like to inspire the creation of a **Logris Vault** system built on top of Alchemix that automates *The Double Logris* for everyone in a tax efficient manner. To the user this is as simple as depositing the token corresponding to the Alchemix vault and for which liquidity can be flash loaned on that chain to receive an lvToken LP that just appreciates in value like cTokens do while using maximum Alchemix leverage as the yield strategy. This turns all the loan forgiveness income + capital losses from *The Double Logris* into pure capital gains which is simpler, a more familiar Defi primitive, more compatible with all the tax tools you guys are familiar with, and can be pooled for gas efficiency on refreshing/maxing out the leverage.\n\nUnder the hood here is what it does:\n\n1) Take deposit and calculate share of pool owed to depositer.\n\n2) Calculate maximum deposit including any outstanding debt forgiveness and flash loan (max out the system).\n\n3) Flash loan for maximum effect given the pools LTV.\n\n4) Deposit the lump sum.\n\n5) Borrow maximum on Alchemix.\n\n6) Trade for underlying.\n\n7) Repay flash loan.\n\nIf this sounds like a Yearn vault to you, it's very similar. It potentially could be a Yearn vault strategy but there's a bit of a snake eating it's tail if it's done inside of Yearn since the first thing the deposits on Alchemix do is end up inside of Yearn. But I'm willing to entertain the idea of writing this as a Yearn strategy if I can find someone competent there to render an opinion. Alternatively I'm interested in partnering with the AlchemixDAO to build this out as an application of Alchemix within their platform.\n\nMight be a fun thing to get involved in /u/revraS8 if you are serious about taking the time to learn Solidity and want a project to build a resume.\n\nTo the US user this is a difference of about 20% taxes owed to the US government. Further, I'm currently visiting Puerto Rico where I could use Act 60 to turn this into 0% taxes owed. On a mid six-figure residual income the difference between 35% taxes and 0% is an enormous difference in quality of life.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The most common question I&#39;ve been asked regarding my <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-double-logris\">Double Logris</a> post is how to do it.

This turns all the loan forgiveness income + capital losses from <em>The Double Logris</em> into pure capital gains which is simpler, a more familiar Defi primitive, more compatible with all the tax tools you guys are familiar with, and can be pooled for gas efficiency on refreshing/maxing out the leverage.</p>\n\n<p>Under the hood here is what it does:</p>\n\n<p>1) Take deposit and calculate share of pool owed to depositer.</p>\n\n<p>2) Calculate maximum deposit including any outstanding debt forgiveness and flash loan (max out the system).</p>\n\n<p>3) Flash loan for maximum effect given the pools LTV.</p>\n\n<p>4) Deposit the lump sum.</p>\n\n<p>5) Borrow maximum on Alchemix.</p>\n\n<p>6) Trade for underlying.</p>\n\n<p>7) Repay flash loan.</p>\n\n<p>If this sounds like a Yearn vault to you, it&#39;s very similar. It potentially could be a Yearn vault strategy but there&#39;s a bit of a snake eating it&#39;s tail if it&#39;s done inside of Yearn since the first thing the deposits on Alchemix do is end up inside of Yearn. But I&#39;m willing to entertain the idea of writing this as a Yearn strategy if I can find someone competent there to render an opinion. Alternatively I&#39;m interested in partnering with the AlchemixDAO to build this out as an application of Alchemix within their platform.</p>\n\n<p>Might be a fun thing to get involved in <a href=\"/u/revraS8\">/u/revraS8</a> if you are serious about taking the time to learn Solidity and want a project to build a resume.</p>\n\n<p>To the US user this is a difference of about 20% taxes owed to the US government. Further, I&#39;m currently visiting Puerto Rico where I could use Act 60 to turn this into 0% taxes owed. On a mid six-figure residual income the difference between 35% taxes and 0% is an enormous difference in quality of life.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-18 04:32:37","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-03-18 04:53:34","id":"i152i74","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tgul2p","parent_id":"t3_tgul2p","score":65,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nikola_j","body":"Quick reply on behalf of DFS team - we like to see some stability and longevity in general from protocols before we consider integrations and Alchemix has certainly proved itself by now.

But while this might be enough to SIM-swap someone, the thieves take this a step further to try to figure out how much is in the account before SIM-swapping someone.</p>\n\n<p>DREW:  I don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re gonna believe me whenever I tell you this, but there was an exploit in Coinbase for about one month where you could check the balance of any valid password and username.  You could \u2013 no matter what.  You didn\u2019t need to have any sort of access except username and password.  So, you didn\u2019t need to SIM them to see their balance.  So, people just ran millions upon millions of combos, combo list through Coinbase, and just found the millionaires of Coinbase.  There\u2019s obviously millions of those.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-18 14:09:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i17c4p8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tgul2p","parent_id":"t3_tgul2p","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/llamachef","body":"I heartily encourage everyone to listen to this and every episode of Darknet Diaries, they're excellent","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I heartily encourage everyone to listen to this and every episode of Darknet Diaries, they&#39;re excellent</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-18 21:21:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i18tz4y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tgul2p","parent_id":"t1_i17c4p8","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/nested_dreams","body":"Ray showed up looking for a fight today.
