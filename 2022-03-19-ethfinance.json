While unnecessary complexity should be avoided when simpler alternatives are available, a smart contract platform aiming to be the settlement layer of the internet would obviously have an incredible level of complexity, especially for a \"living\" project like Ethereum which evolves as the industry, the tech and even the theoretical frontier evolves.
