It allows for \u201csmart contracts\u201d to be programmed to automatically execute a task when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nDevelopers around the world have discovered ethereum\u2019s smart contracts can perform a range of tasks, including much of what the existing banking system spends billions of dollars facilitating every year: determining whom to lend to.\n\nThe phenomenon has not been lost on traditional financial institutions, who are scrambling to work out how to use aspects of the technology to defend their dominant position in the financial system.\n\nMinister for the Digital Economy Jane Hume told the Blockchain Australia event on Monday that so-called \u2018decentralised finance\u2019 is \u201cone of the most exciting frontiers I have seen\u201d, encouraging entrepreneurs to use ethereum and similar technologies to challenge incumbent banks.\n\n\u201cCrypto assets are a powerful way to develop consumer owned networks,\u201d she said. \u201cThey provide a level playing field and don\u2019t change the rules.\u201d\n\nMr Lubin told a conference hosted by industry body Blockchain Australia that ethereum was not being met with the same levels of official enthusiasm in other countries.\n\n\u201cPoliticians and regulators may not like the tools of our ecosystem because they don\u2019t understand them, or they have their own agendas,\u201d he said ahead of an appearance at The Australian Financial Review Cryptocurrency Summit on April 6.\n\n\u201cBut they are going to have to come to terms that this is all happening, it is really powerful, and it is now on the main stage.\u201d\n\nOne of the largest criticisms of blockchain technology is its enormous use of energy. To secure and maintain blockchains, thousands of computers work together to confirm and verify the location of all tokens at any time.\n\nMr Lubin said that in June or July, ethereum will be upgraded to massively reduce its energy usage and increase transaction speed. This will occur when it shifts from a \u2018proof of work\u2019 system to one involving \u2018proof of stake\u2019.\n\n\nEthereum tokens are used to power the decentralised network.

It was one of the first banks in the world to move to offer crypto in its banking app, which Ms Gilder said was a response to customer demand, after it looked at account data and noticed 900,000 customers had transferred money into crypto exchanges over a two-year period.\n\n\u201cOur customers are already there; it is already mainstream based on our stats,\u201d she said.\n\nNow the crypto pilot is set to be extended. \u201cWe have noticed engagement in the app is up for people who are part of the pilot,\u201d Ms Gilder said.\n\n\u201cOverwhelmingly the feedback has been positive. The biggest complaint we have had is from customers who haven\u2019t been let into the pilot yet ... We are looking to scale and add additional features this calendar year.\u201d\n\nHowever, banks are disadvantaged compared to crypto start-ups because they must operate within regulatory constraints.\n\n\u201cThe regulatory framework that exists today makes it very difficult,\u201d said Andrew Gee, an executive director at Macquarie Bank.\n\n\u201cWhile there is a huge amount of interest about the potential for the technology, as a regulated institution, we have to approach things very cautiously.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Macquarie is investing to learn and \u201cwhat we are doing today won\u2019t be the same as what we are doing in 12 months time, or even 6 months time, but we have to work in lockstep with what the regulatory framework allows us to do,\u201d Mr Gee said.\n\nOther investment banks are investing heavily in blockchain to create new networks. JP Morgan has been a leader, creating Quorum on ethereum in 2018 to tokenise assets; in 2020, it built Onyx, a blockchain platform to exchange value and digital asserts.\n\nVisa said it had surveyed Australians and found 27 per cent owned or had owned crypto assets, with 82 per cent saying they wanted to buy them from a major financial institution.

But that's not the half of it. The crypto boom has generated vast new fortunes at a clip we've never seen before --- the closest comparison is probably the discovery of oil in the Middle East --- and has turned its\u00a0[biggest winners](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-01-09/binance-ceo-cz-s-net-worth-billionaire-holds-world-s-biggest-crypto-fortune)\u00a0into some of the richest people in the world, essentially overnight. Some riches could vanish if the market crashes, but enough has already been cashed out to ensure that crypto's influence will linger for decades.\n\nCrypto's madcap, meme-crazed online culture can make it seem frivolous and shallow. It's not. Cryptocurrencies, even the jokey ones, are part of a robust, well-funded ideological movement that has serious implications for our political and economic future. Bitcoin, which emerged out of the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis, first caught on among libertarians and anti-establishment activists who saw it as the cornerstone of a new, incorruptible monetary system. Since then, other crypto realms have fashioned similarly lofty goals, like building a decentralized, largely unregulated version of Wall Street on the blockchain.\n\nWe are already starting to see a swell of crypto money headed toward the U.S. political system. Crypto entrepreneurs are\u00a0[donating millions of dollars to candidates](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/sam-bankman-fried-biden-donor.html)\u00a0and causes, and lobbying firms have\u00a0[fanned out](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/business/dealbook/crypto-lobbyists.html)\u00a0across the country to win support for pro-crypto legislation. In the coming years, crypto moguls will bankroll the campaigns of crypto-friendly candidates, or run for office themselves. Some will peddle influence in the familiar ways --- forming super PACs, funding think tanks, etc. --- while others will try to escape partisan gridlock altogether. (Crypto millionaires are already\u00a0[buying up land in the South Pacific](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3n38x/cryptocurrency-investors-try-to-turn-private-islands-into-blockchain-utopias)\u00a0to build their own blockchain utopias.)\n\nCrypto is poised to soon become one of a handful of true wedge issues, with politicians all over the world forced to pick a side. Some countries, like El Salvador --- whose crypto-loving president, Nayib Bukele, recently\u00a0[announced\u00a0](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/bitcoin-city-el-salvador-inspired-ancient-greeks-s-reality-check-rcna6944)the development of a \"Bitcoin City\" at the base of a volcano --- will go full crypto. Other governments may decide that crypto is a threat to their sovereignty and crack down, as China did when it\u00a0[outlawed cryptocurrency trading](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/business/china-cryptocurrency-bitcoin.html)\u00a0last year. The divide between the world's pro-crypto and no-crypto zones could end up being at least as big as the divide between the Chinese internet and the American one, and maybe even more consequential.\n\nIn America, we have already seen how crypto can scramble the usual partisan allegiances. Former President Donald J. Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, are united in crypto skepticism, for example, while Senator Ted Cruz, Republican from Texas, is in the same bullish camp as Senator Ron Wyden, the Democrat from Oregon. We have also seen what can happen when the crypto community feels politically threatened, as happened last summer, when crypto groups\u00a0[rallied to oppose a crypto-related provision](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/politics/infrastructure-cryptocurrency.html)\u00a0in President Biden's infrastructure bill.\n\nWhat I'm saying, I guess, is that despite the goofy veneer, crypto is not just another weird internet phenomenon. It's an organized technological movement, armed with powerful tools and hordes of wealthy true believers, whose goal is nothing less than a total economic and political revolution.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><h3>CRYPTO WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE</h3>\n\n<p>Understanding crypto now --- especially if you&#39;re naturally skeptical --- is important for a few reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The first is that crypto wealth and ideology is going to be a transformative force in our society in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve heard about the overnight\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/technology/hes-a-dogecoin-millionaire-and-hes-not-selling.html\">Dogecoin millionaires</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html\">Lamborghini-driving Bitcoin bros</a>.

Some riches could vanish if the market crashes, but enough has already been cashed out to ensure that crypto&#39;s influence will linger for decades.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto&#39;s madcap, meme-crazed online culture can make it seem frivolous and shallow. It&#39;s not. Cryptocurrencies, even the jokey ones, are part of a robust, well-funded ideological movement that has serious implications for our political and economic future. Bitcoin, which emerged out of the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis, first caught on among libertarians and anti-establishment activists who saw it as the cornerstone of a new, incorruptible monetary system. Since then, other crypto realms have fashioned similarly lofty goals, like building a decentralized, largely unregulated version of Wall Street on the blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>We are already starting to see a swell of crypto money headed toward the U.S. political system. Crypto entrepreneurs are\u00a0<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/sam-bankman-fried-biden-donor.html\">donating millions of dollars to candidates</a>\u00a0and causes, and lobbying firms have\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/business/dealbook/crypto-lobbyists.html\">fanned out</a>\u00a0across the country to win support for pro-crypto legislation. In the coming years, crypto moguls will bankroll the campaigns of crypto-friendly candidates, or run for office themselves. Some will peddle influence in the familiar ways --- forming super PACs, funding think tanks, etc. --- while others will try to escape partisan gridlock altogether. (Crypto millionaires are already\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3n38x/cryptocurrency-investors-try-to-turn-private-islands-into-blockchain-utopias\">buying up land in the South Pacific</a>\u00a0to build their own blockchain utopias.)</p>\n\n<p>Crypto is poised to soon become one of a handful of true wedge issues, with politicians all over the world forced to pick a side. Some countries, like El Salvador --- whose crypto-loving president, Nayib Bukele, recently\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/bitcoin-city-el-salvador-inspired-ancient-greeks-s-reality-check-rcna6944\">announced\u00a0</a>the development of a &quot;Bitcoin City&quot; at the base of a volcano --- will go full crypto. Other governments may decide that crypto is a threat to their sovereignty and crack down, as China did when it\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/business/china-cryptocurrency-bitcoin.html\">outlawed cryptocurrency trading</a>\u00a0last year. The divide between the world&#39;s pro-crypto and no-crypto zones could end up being at least as big as the divide between the Chinese internet and the American one, and maybe even more consequential.</p>\n\n<p>In America, we have already seen how crypto can scramble the usual partisan allegiances. Former President Donald J. Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, are united in crypto skepticism, for example, while Senator Ted Cruz, Republican from Texas, is in the same bullish camp as Senator Ron Wyden, the Democrat from Oregon. We have also seen what can happen when the crypto community feels politically threatened, as happened last summer, when crypto groups\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/politics/infrastructure-cryptocurrency.html\">rallied to oppose a crypto-related provision</a>\u00a0in President Biden&#39;s infrastructure bill.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m saying, I guess, is that despite the goofy veneer, crypto is not just another weird internet phenomenon. It&#39;s an organized technological movement, armed with powerful tools and hordes of wealthy true believers, whose goal is nothing less than a total economic and political revolution.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-21 06:28:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i1j0azf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tj4u7q","parent_id":"t1_i1j09n5","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"### CRYPTO COULD BE DESTRUCTIVE\n\nThe second reason to pay attention to crypto is that understanding it now is the best way to ensure it doesn't become a destructive force later.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the most common knock on social media apps like Facebook and Twitter was that they just wouldn't work as businesses.

But in recent years, it's been more closely associated with cryptocurrencies. These days, \"crypto\" usually refers to the entire universe of technologies that involve blockchains --- the distributed ledger systems that power digital currencies like Bitcoin, but also serve as the base layer of technology for things like NFTs, web3 applications and DeFi trading protocols.\n\nAh yes, blockchains. Can you remind me, without going into too much technical detail, what they are?\n\nAt a very basic level,\u00a0[blockchains](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/business/dealbook/blockchains-guide-information.html)\u00a0are shared databases that store and verify information in a cryptographically secure way.\n\nYou can think of a blockchain like a Google spreadsheet, except that instead of being hosted on Google's servers, blockchains are maintained by a network of computers all over the world. These computers (sometimes called miners or validators) are responsible for storing their own copies of the database, adding and verifying new entries, and securing the database against hackers.\n\nSo blockchains are ... fancy Google spreadsheets?\n\nSort of! But there are at least three important conceptual differences.\n\nFirst, a blockchain is decentralized. It doesn't need a company like Google overseeing it. All of that work is done by the computers on the network, using what's called a consensus mechanism --- basically, a complicated algorithm that allows them to agree on what's in a database without the need for a neutral referee. This makes blockchains more secure than traditional record-keeping systems, proponents believe, since no single person or company can take down the blockchain or alter its contents, and anyone trying to hack or change the records in the ledger would need to break into many computers simultaneously.\n\nThe second major feature of blockchains is that they're typically public and open source, meaning that unlike a Google spreadsheet, anyone can inspect a public blockchain's code or see a record of any transaction. (There are private blockchains, but they're less important than the public ones.)\n\nThird, blockchains are typically append-only and permanent, meaning that unlike with a Google spreadsheet, data that's added to a blockchain typically can't be deleted or changed after the fact.\n\nGot it. So blockchains are public, permanent databases that nobody owns?\n\nYou're getting it!\n\nNow remind me: How are blockchains related to cryptocurrencies?\n\nBlockchains didn't really exist until 2009, when a pseudonymous programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto released the technical documentation for Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin used a blockchain to keep track of transactions. That was notable because, for the first time, it allowed people to send and receive money over the internet without needing to involve a central authority, such as a bank or an app like PayPal or Venmo.\n\nMany blockchains still perform cryptocurrency transactions, and there are now roughly 10,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, according to CoinMarketCap. But many blockchains can be used to store other kinds of information, too --- including NFTs, bits of self-executing code known as smart contracts and full-fledged apps --- without the need for a central authority.\n\nOK, but can we back up a second? Weren't tech people telling us, years ago, that crypto was a new and exciting form of money? And yet, nobody I know pays their rent or buys groceries in Bitcoin. So were those people just ... wrong?\n\nGood question. It's true that today, hardly anyone pays for things in cryptocurrency. In part, that's because most merchants still don't accept crypto payments, and hefty transaction fees can make it impractical to spend small amounts of cryptocurrency on daily living expenses. It's also because the value of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether has historically gone up, making it somewhat risky to use them for offline purchases. (The counterexamples are usually cited with pity, like the\u00a0[guy\u00a0](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-pizza-day-laszlo-hanyecz-spent-3-8-billion-on-pizzas-in-the-summer-of-2010-using-the-novel-crypto-11621714395)who, in 2010, bought two Papa John's pizzas using Bitcoin that was worth about $40 at the time, but would be worth roughly $400 million today.)\n\nIt's also true that the value of cryptocurrencies has grown enormously since the early Bitcoin days, despite them\u00a0not\u00a0being most people's daily spending money.\n\nPart of that growth is speculation --- people buying crypto assets in hopes of selling them for more later on. Part of it is because the blockchains that have emerged since Bitcoin, like Ethereum and Solana, have expanded what can be done with this technology.\n\nAnd some crypto fans believe that the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will eventually stabilize, which could make them more useful as a means of payment.\n\nWhat are the actual uses of crypto, beyond financial speculation?\n\nRight now, many of the successful applications for crypto technology are in finance or finance-adjacent fields. For example, people are using crypto to\u00a0[send cross-border remittances](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/new-study-crypto-emerging-as-favored-form-for-cross-border-remittances/)\u00a0to family members abroad and Wall Street banks\u00a0[using blockchains](https://www.yahoo.com/now/wells-fargo-hsbc-settle-forex-104550015.html)\u00a0to settle foreign transactions.\n\nThe crypto boom has also led to an explosion of experiments outside of financial services. There are\u00a0[crypto social clubs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html),\u00a0[crypto video games](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-25/axie-infinity-how-game-is-turning-pandemic-jobless-into-crypto-nft-traders),\u00a0[crypto restaurants\u00a0](https://ny.eater.com/2022/1/13/22880787/worlds-first-nft-restaurant-flyfish-club-opening-nyc)and even\u00a0[crypto-powered wireless networks](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html).\n\nThese non-financial uses are still fairly limited. But crypto fans often make the case that the technology is still young, and that it took the internet decades to mature into what it is today. Investors are pouring billions of dollars into crypto start-ups because they think that someday, blockchains will be used for all kinds of things: storing medical records, tracking streaming music rights, even hosting new social media platforms. And the crypto ecosystem is\u00a0[attracting tons of developers](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d)\u00a0--- an auspicious sign for any new technology.\n\nI've heard people calling crypto a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme. What do they mean?\n\nSome critics believe that cryptocurrency markets are fundamentally fraudulent, either because early investors get rich at the expense of late investors (a pyramid scheme), or because crypto projects lure in unsuspecting investors with promises of safe returns, then collapse once new money stops coming in (a Ponzi scheme).\n\nThere are certainly plenty of examples of pyramid and Ponzi schemes\u00a0within\u00a0crypto. They include OneCoin, a\u00a0[fraudulent crypto operation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/onecoin-took-in-billions-then-its-leader-vanished-11598520601)\u00a0that stole $4 billion from investors from 2014 to 2019; and Virgil Sigma Fund, a $90 million crypto hedge fund run by a 24-year-old investor who\u00a0[pleaded guilty to securities fraud](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-cryptocurrency-fund-manager-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-11631736989)\u00a0and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.\n\nBut these cases aren't usually what critics are talking about. They're generally arguing that crypto\u00a0itself\u00a0is an exploitative scheme, with no real-world value.\n\nAnd are they right?\n\nWell, let's try to understand the case they're making.\n\nUnlike buying stock in, say, Apple, a purchase that (theoretically, at least) reflects a belief that Apple's underlying business is healthy, buying a cryptocurrency is more like betting on the success of an idea, they say. If people believe in Bitcoin, they buy, and Bitcoin prices go up. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, they sell, and Bitcoin prices go down.\n\nCrypto owners, then, have a rational incentive to convince other people to buy. And if you don't think that cryptocurrency technology is inherently valuable, you might conclude that the entire thing resembles a pyramid scheme, in which you primarily make money by recruiting others to join.\n\nI'm sensing a \"but\" coming on.\n\nBut! Even though there are scams and frauds within crypto, and crypto investors are certainly fond of trying to recruit other people to buy in, many investors will tell you that they are going in with their eyes wide open.\n\nThey believe that crypto technology is inherently valuable, and that the ability to store information and value on a decentralized blockchain will be attractive to all kinds of people and businesses in the future. They would tell you they're betting on crypto the product, not crypto the idea --- which, on some level, isn't all that different from buying Apple stock because you think the next iPhone is going to be popular.\n\nMatt Huang, a prominent investor, spoke for many crypto fans when\u00a0[he said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1397289945321164802): \"Crypto may look like a speculative casino from the outside. But that distracts many from the deeper truth: the casino is a trojan horse with a new financial system hidden inside.\"\n\nYou can argue with that position, or dispute how much this \"new financial system\" is actually worth. But crypto investors clearly believe it's worth\u00a0something.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Let&#39;s start from the beginning: What is crypto?</p>\n\n<p>A decade or two ago, the word was generally used as shorthand for cryptography.

So blockchains are public, permanent databases that nobody owns?</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re getting it!</p>\n\n<p>Now remind me: How are blockchains related to cryptocurrencies?</p>\n\n<p>Blockchains didn&#39;t really exist until 2009, when a pseudonymous programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto released the technical documentation for Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin used a blockchain to keep track of transactions. That was notable because, for the first time, it allowed people to send and receive money over the internet without needing to involve a central authority, such as a bank or an app like PayPal or Venmo.</p>\n\n<p>Many blockchains still perform cryptocurrency transactions, and there are now roughly 10,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, according to CoinMarketCap. But many blockchains can be used to store other kinds of information, too --- including NFTs, bits of self-executing code known as smart contracts and full-fledged apps --- without the need for a central authority.</p>\n\n<p>OK, but can we back up a second? Weren&#39;t tech people telling us, years ago, that crypto was a new and exciting form of money? And yet, nobody I know pays their rent or buys groceries in Bitcoin. So were those people just ... wrong?</p>\n\n<p>Good question. It&#39;s true that today, hardly anyone pays for things in cryptocurrency. In part, that&#39;s because most merchants still don&#39;t accept crypto payments, and hefty transaction fees can make it impractical to spend small amounts of cryptocurrency on daily living expenses. It&#39;s also because the value of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether has historically gone up, making it somewhat risky to use them for offline purchases. (The counterexamples are usually cited with pity, like the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-pizza-day-laszlo-hanyecz-spent-3-8-billion-on-pizzas-in-the-summer-of-2010-using-the-novel-crypto-11621714395\">guy\u00a0</a>who, in 2010, bought two Papa John&#39;s pizzas using Bitcoin that was worth about $40 at the time, but would be worth roughly $400 million today.)</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also true that the value of cryptocurrencies has grown enormously since the early Bitcoin days, despite them\u00a0not\u00a0being most people&#39;s daily spending money.</p>\n\n<p>Part of that growth is speculation --- people buying crypto assets in hopes of selling them for more later on. Part of it is because the blockchains that have emerged since Bitcoin, like Ethereum and Solana, have expanded what can be done with this technology.</p>\n\n<p>And some crypto fans believe that the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will eventually stabilize, which could make them more useful as a means of payment.</p>\n\n<p>What are the actual uses of crypto, beyond financial speculation?</p>\n\n<p>Right now, many of the successful applications for crypto technology are in finance or finance-adjacent fields. For example, people are using crypto to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/new-study-crypto-emerging-as-favored-form-for-cross-border-remittances/\">send cross-border remittances</a>\u00a0to family members abroad and Wall Street banks\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/wells-fargo-hsbc-settle-forex-104550015.html\">using blockchains</a>\u00a0to settle foreign transactions.</p>\n\n<p>The crypto boom has also led to an explosion of experiments outside of financial services. There are\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html\">crypto social clubs</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-25/axie-infinity-how-game-is-turning-pandemic-jobless-into-crypto-nft-traders\">crypto video games</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://ny.eater.com/2022/1/13/22880787/worlds-first-nft-restaurant-flyfish-club-opening-nyc\">crypto restaurants\u00a0</a>and even\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html\">crypto-powered wireless networks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These non-financial uses are still fairly limited. But crypto fans often make the case that the technology is still young, and that it took the internet decades to mature into what it is today. Investors are pouring billions of dollars into crypto start-ups because they think that someday, blockchains will be used for all kinds of things: storing medical records, tracking streaming music rights, even hosting new social media platforms. And the crypto ecosystem is\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d\">attracting tons of developers</a>\u00a0--- an auspicious sign for any new technology.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve heard people calling crypto a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme. What do they mean?</p>\n\n<p>Some critics believe that cryptocurrency markets are fundamentally fraudulent, either because early investors get rich at the expense of late investors (a pyramid scheme), or because crypto projects lure in unsuspecting investors with promises of safe returns, then collapse once new money stops coming in (a Ponzi scheme).</p>\n\n<p>There are certainly plenty of examples of pyramid and Ponzi schemes\u00a0within\u00a0crypto. They include OneCoin, a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/onecoin-took-in-billions-then-its-leader-vanished-11598520601\">fraudulent crypto operation</a>\u00a0that stole $4 billion from investors from 2014 to 2019; and Virgil Sigma Fund, a $90 million crypto hedge fund run by a 24-year-old investor who\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-cryptocurrency-fund-manager-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-11631736989\">pleaded guilty to securities fraud</a>\u00a0and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.</p>\n\n<p>But these cases aren&#39;t usually what critics are talking about. They&#39;re generally arguing that crypto\u00a0itself\u00a0is an exploitative scheme, with no real-world value.</p>\n\n<p>And are they right?</p>\n\n<p>Well, let&#39;s try to understand the case they&#39;re making.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike buying stock in, say, Apple, a purchase that (theoretically, at least) reflects a belief that Apple&#39;s underlying business is healthy, buying a cryptocurrency is more like betting on the success of an idea, they say. If people believe in Bitcoin, they buy, and Bitcoin prices go up. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, they sell, and Bitcoin prices go down.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto owners, then, have a rational incentive to convince other people to buy. And if you don&#39;t think that cryptocurrency technology is inherently valuable, you might conclude that the entire thing resembles a pyramid scheme, in which you primarily make money by recruiting others to join.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sensing a &quot;but&quot; coming on.</p>\n\n<p>But! Even though there are scams and frauds within crypto, and crypto investors are certainly fond of trying to recruit other people to buy in, many investors will tell you that they are going in with their eyes wide open.</p>\n\n<p>They believe that crypto technology is inherently valuable, and that the ability to store information and value on a decentralized blockchain will be attractive to all kinds of people and businesses in the future. They would tell you they&#39;re betting on crypto the product, not crypto the idea --- which, on some level, isn&#39;t all that different from buying Apple stock because you think the next iPhone is going to be popular.</p>\n\n<p>Matt Huang, a prominent investor, spoke for many crypto fans when\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1397289945321164802\">he said on Twitter</a>: &quot;Crypto may look like a speculative casino from the outside. But that distracts many from the deeper truth: the casino is a trojan horse with a new financial system hidden inside.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You can argue with that position, or dispute how much this &quot;new financial system&quot; is actually worth. But crypto investors clearly believe it&#39;s worth\u00a0something.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-21 06:29:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i1j0eyn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tj4u7q","parent_id":"t1_i1j0dad","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"Is crypto regulated?\n\nOnly slightly.

It's true that most crypto activity today takes place on blockchains that require large amounts of energy to store and verify transactions. These networks use a \"proof-of-work\" consensus mechanism --- a process that has been compared to a global guessing game, played by computers all competing to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to add new information to the database and earn a reward in return. Solving these puzzles requires powerful computers, which in turn use lots of energy.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain, for example, uses an estimated 200 terawatt-hours of energy per year, according to Digiconomist, a website that\u00a0[tracks crypto energy usage](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption). That's comparable to the annual energy consumption of Thailand. And Bitcoin's associated carbon emissions have been estimated at roughly 100 megatons per year, which is comparable to the carbon footprint of the Czech Republic.\n\nHoly moly! How do crypto fans justify that kind of environmental impact?\n\nCrypto advocates often\u00a0[quibble with these statistics](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/08/what-bloomberg-gets-wrong-about-bitcoins-climate-footprint/). They also argue that:\n\n- Our existing financial system also uses a lot of energy, between powering millions of bank branches, A.T.M.s that sit idle for most of the day, gold mines and other energy-intensive infrastructure.\n\n- Many crypto-mining computers are already powered by renewable energy sources, or by energy that would otherwise be wasted.\n\n- Most newer blockchains are built using consensus mechanisms that require much less energy than proof-of-work. (Ethereum, for example, is scheduled to switch to a new type of consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake sometime in 2022, which could reduce its energy usage by as much as 99.5 percent.)\n\nAnd are those arguments valid?\n\nPartly. It's true that most newer blockchains are designed in a way that requires considerably less energy than Bitcoin, and that Ethereum's switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism will greatly shrink its environmental footprint, if and when it happens.\n\nBut it's also a bit convenient to steer attention away from Bitcoin, which is still the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Bitcoin's energy needs aren't expected to fall significantly anytime soon. And even if every Bitcoin miner ran entirely on renewable energy --- which, to be clear, isn't the case --- there would still be an environmental cost associated with maintaining the blockchain.\n\nAll told, it's clear that crypto as we know it today has a significant environmental impact, but it's hard to measure exactly how significant. Many frequently cited statistics come from industry groups, and it's hard to find trustworthy, independent data and analysis.\n\nBut few crypto fans would dispute that blockchains consume substantially more energy than a traditional, centralized database would --- just as 100 refrigerators use more energy than one refrigerator. They just argue that crypto's environmental impact will shrink over time, and that the benefits of decentralization are worth the costs.\n\nGot it. And those benefits, again, are ...\n\nSome crypto proponents will tell you that the biggest benefit of decentralization is the ability to create currencies, apps and virtual economies that are resistant to censorship and top-down control. (Imagine a version of Facebook, they'll say, in which Mark Zuckerberg couldn't unilaterally decide to kick people off.)\n\nOthers will say that the biggest perk of decentralization is that it allows artists and creators to control their own economic destinies more directly by giving them a way (in the form of NFTs and other crypto assets) to bypass platform gatekeepers like YouTube and Spotify, and sell unique digital works directly to their fans.\n\nStill others will say that crypto is most useful to people who don't live in countries with stable currencies, or to dissident groups living under authoritarian regimes.\n\nThere are a million other hypothetical benefits of decentralization and crypto, some of which are realistic and some of which probably aren't.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>And what about extremists?

Many frequently cited statistics come from industry groups, and it&#39;s hard to find trustworthy, independent data and analysis.</p>\n\n<p>But few crypto fans would dispute that blockchains consume substantially more energy than a traditional, centralized database would --- just as 100 refrigerators use more energy than one refrigerator. They just argue that crypto&#39;s environmental impact will shrink over time, and that the benefits of decentralization are worth the costs.</p>\n\n<p>Got it. And those benefits, again, are ...</p>\n\n<p>Some crypto proponents will tell you that the biggest benefit of decentralization is the ability to create currencies, apps and virtual economies that are resistant to censorship and top-down control. (Imagine a version of Facebook, they&#39;ll say, in which Mark Zuckerberg couldn&#39;t unilaterally decide to kick people off.)</p>\n\n<p>Others will say that the biggest perk of decentralization is that it allows artists and creators to control their own economic destinies more directly by giving them a way (in the form of NFTs and other crypto assets) to bypass platform gatekeepers like YouTube and Spotify, and sell unique digital works directly to their fans.</p>\n\n<p>Still others will say that crypto is most useful to people who don&#39;t live in countries with stable currencies, or to dissident groups living under authoritarian regimes.</p>\n\n<p>There are a million other hypothetical benefits of decentralization and crypto, some of which are realistic and some of which probably aren&#39;t.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-21 06:30:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i1j0ihj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tj4u7q","parent_id":"t1_i1j0ha3","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"How do you actually use crypto?
