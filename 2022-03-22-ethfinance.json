Almost all of these wrappers are less than 3 years old and the IRS literally have no rules for them. There's conservative tax strategy, and aggressive tax strategy. People in this sub tend to do the former, but there's plenty who do the latter as well, and there's nothing wrong with either. You can also find accountants who will take more aggressive approaches for you.\n\n> any crypto-to-crypto transaction is a taxable event.\n\nYou can easily make the case that it is not a distinct crypto-to-crypto transaction though. It clearly isn't something like a BTC->ETH trade, these wrapper tokens are directly redeemable for the underlying asset, and their price directly correlates. The token is effectively just receipt for the original asset. \n\nLet me ask you this--when you bridge to L2 or another L1, do you treat that as a taxable event? Seems to me that if you are doing so with token wrappers you should there to, as technically they are issuing you a new token that is distinct from the original. In both cases, the token is effectively just receipt for the original asset.

The next punk. The next ape. Over time, the NFT market will continue to dilute itself and funnel money from the greedy right out of this ecosystem (partially into the pockets of artists, which is good, but mostly into cash grabby teams). \n\nThe other piece of the current NFT use case is \u201ccommunity,\u201d which in the current form is either a token gated discord server or in person events, both of which people will get tired of and especially when their PFP starts bleeding vs ETH, which will eventually make people panic further out of the current iteration of NFTs.\n\nImo, the merge will spawn a length NFT bear market (6-12+ months) and the \u201cgood\u201d teams during that time won\u2019t be hit so hard and will continue to grow + really take off down the road.\n\nOverall, I\u2019ve always been majorly excited about NFTs.

We went from 'merge in June' to 'in 1 month we'll decide if merge in June'.\n\nIf the difficulty bomb is pushed back again they will delay it by 3-6 months and the story will be that it's the worst case scenario not a target date for the merge. Surely it will happen before that people will say, they're just pushing it back by 3 months so they don't have to do it again in 1 month in case a catastrophic bug is found. \n\nI would like to remind everyone that this was the story after the last difficulty bomb delay in October/November 2021. Despite a difficulty bomb delay to May/June 2022, everyone called for the merge in Q1 2022, then early Q2 2022, we're pushing it with a potential date in June which is late Q2 2022. June wasn't the plan, if u go back in time and listen to podcasts line Anthony Sassano and others you will hear frequent references to the merge happening in Q1 2022.

And know that if the difficulty bomb is delayed by 3 or 6 months then that will likely be the new target date for the merge, it won't happen before no matter what you hear from podcasters or developers. \n\nMy longstanding gripe with this whole process has been the lack of pressure by the community on the developers. If they deliver they're praised, if they don't and they delay people say they're doing it for safety. I don't see any changes to this dynamic so I fully expect unaccountable people to continue to be unaccountable. In a way it's not the devs fault it's the fault of the enablers.\n\nI guess that this comment will get lot of downvotes like my previous posts during the last delay(s) but I was proven right before so I have no regrets about speaking the truth.

This is a major problem for the entire sector by the way not just the Ethereum community. \n\nI may do a longer post on this 'actually good news mentality' but the most obvious example of this behavior happened when disastrous legislation was passed in USA house& senate. Everyone in crypto paraded around like they won. Yeah we really showed them, our voices were heard! They can't ignore us anymore!
