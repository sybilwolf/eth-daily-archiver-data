I think there are more novel applications of the NFT tech that Gamespot could pursue. For example, a resale market for digitial game liscenses could be pretty lucrative as it would allow for finer grained price discrimanation by game developers. There is well developed microeconomic theory explaining why this is strictly more profitable than being able to offer only a single price accross the board.    \n\nPersonally the idea that I've been most excited about is the possibility of moving the transaction and settlement of all of their floating shares over to this public and verifable DEX, which would be something truly revolutionary.    \n\nCurrently in the world of tradfi there is this problem where settlement of stock trades has become highly centralized around a clearing house that has been allowing a group of well connected insiders to participate in this activity known as naked short selling, where more shares than actually exist for a company are being sold and not actually delivered to the buyers simply marked down as an IOU of sorts. This effectively enables short sellers to arbitrarily artifically inflate the total number of tradable shares in any company. Imagine being able to sell an infinite number of bitcoins even though there is a fixed supply. The risk of course being that you're exposed to the possibility of a short squeeze if people start to catch on and start buying, which is exactly what happened last year and culminated in them just turning off the ability to buy shares to protect these short sellers. Distributed Ledger Technology makes this sort of shenanigan impossible to accomplish and is a very tangible value add the Defi space can offer over the centralized world of tradfi.    \n\nSomething very similar to this can also be accomplished by issuing a dividen as an NFT to all shareholders as that would force naked short sellers to source and supply said NFT to everyone they've sold fake shares to.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In game NFTs are pretty meh, but it is nonetheless an existing addressable market. I think there are more novel applications of the NFT tech that Gamespot could pursue. For example, a resale market for digitial game liscenses could be pretty lucrative as it would allow for finer grained price discrimanation by game developers. There is well developed microeconomic theory explaining why this is strictly more profitable than being able to offer only a single price accross the board.    </p>\n\n<p>Personally the idea that I&#39;ve been most excited about is the possibility of moving the transaction and settlement of all of their floating shares over to this public and verifable DEX, which would be something truly revolutionary.    </p>\n\n<p>Currently in the world of tradfi there is this problem where settlement of stock trades has become highly centralized around a clearing house that has been allowing a group of well connected insiders to participate in this activity known as naked short selling, where more shares than actually exist for a company are being sold and not actually delivered to the buyers simply marked down as an IOU of sorts. This effectively enables short sellers to arbitrarily artifically inflate the total number of tradable shares in any company. Imagine being able to sell an infinite number of bitcoins even though there is a fixed supply. The risk of course being that you&#39;re exposed to the possibility of a short squeeze if people start to catch on and start buying, which is exactly what happened last year and culminated in them just turning off the ability to buy shares to protect these short sellers. Distributed Ledger Technology makes this sort of shenanigan impossible to accomplish and is a very tangible value add the Defi space can offer over the centralized world of tradfi.    </p>\n\n<p>Something very similar to this can also be accomplished by issuing a dividen as an NFT to all shareholders as that would force naked short sellers to source and supply said NFT to everyone they&#39;ve sold fake shares to.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-23 10:58:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i1toy0i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tknb4f","parent_id":"t1_i1th53c","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"\"But but Imx is the real adoption because I only read the title of the paper thingie.\"\n\nStill LRC got crashed pretty hard because people are dumb.

Even if the viewer has e.g. Metamask installed, the NFT code will not be able to access it for sensible security reasons.

Not cool and not decentralized. \n\nSo here's the idea: I bundle an API key with the NFT. In the NFT smart contract I add a function which allows the owner to set their own API key (or indeed, RPC URL). If the owner has set a key, the NFT will use their key, otherwise it will use the default.\n\nNow if Infura shuts down, or I delete the API key, the NFT owner can always replace the key/URL and bring the NFT back to life.
