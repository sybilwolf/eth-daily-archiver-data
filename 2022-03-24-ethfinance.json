I didn&#39;t take notes but they were overwhelmingly positive on crypto as a whole and specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>Gillibrand has a very tight grasp of crypto&#39;s current state of affairs and knows what needs to happen for it to be properly regulated in the United States and allowed to flourish. Lummis is from very pro-crypto Wyoming and they announced they have drafted a bipartisan crypto positive bill that they believe may come to a vote this year after going through their respective committees and receiving input from relevant stakeholders (CFTC, SEC, Fed, PACs, States, Industry, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m super bullish about this potential bill going into law. It may finally give BTC and ETH clarity as commodities which would open up a whole new world of possibilities (ETH spot ETF anyone?) along with the common sense regulation this industry needs to go to the next level.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll link a video of the discussion to this post later if one pops up. I think it is definitely worth watching. Yeeeeeee</p>\n\n<p>Edit: No videos that I\u2019m seeing and this isn\u2019t much of an article, but it does say they are hoping to introduce the bill \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/24/gillibrand-lummis-cryptocurrency-regulation-00020291\">https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/24/gillibrand-lummis-cryptocurrency-regulation-00020291</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-24 15:28:16","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-03-24 16:51:14","id":"i1zokho","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tlz2a6","parent_id":"t3_tlz2a6","score":46,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hipaces","body":"That's great.
