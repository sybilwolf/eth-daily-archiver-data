I think actually the most accurate projection will end up being his total market cap projection (Not just eth or btc). I think really the only mistake he is making is underestimating how much of the market will be eth dominated soon ( a marketcap peak of 10T~ sounds pretty reasonable to me but saying eth will only be 2T~ is the part I think is wrong). But we could both be wrong and his eth projection might play out.I'm personally paying more attention to the total marketcap.
