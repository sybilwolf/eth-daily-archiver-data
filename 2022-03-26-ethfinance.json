For me it was a realization that,\n<code>\npriority_fee_per_gas = min(transaction.max_priority_fee_per_gas,\n            transaction.max_fee_per_gas - block.base_fee_per_gas)\n</code>\nwhich I found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md\">EIP-1559 code</a>. This shows that the calculation <code>maxFeePerGas = baseFeePerGas + maxPriorityFeePerGas</code> does not always hold true as you sometimes read online.</p>\n\n<p>I know at least one other person that found this post helpful, so I thought why not share it here.
