Recommended setup would have a private key protected by a passphrase, so that you're not using any system passwords. In this case, you would disable password logins and use only shared key. Once configured, it certainly should not change behavior (e.g. not let you in). Be careful though because if you perform any package updates, you might accidentally overwrite your custom configuration with default settings.\n\nMy recommendation when running on a testnet is 1) get things set up how you want then, 2) to try to break stuff. For example, change client configuration to see if it behaves as you expect (e.g. change numbers of peers, network ports, etc). See what happens when you randomly cut the power - can you recover?

A pow chain where you need 10b of asics to attack, a DPOS (Or pure POS without slashing)  where you need to buy 10B of the token to attack, and a eth style POS where you need 10B of the token to attack.\nNow that you have enough to attack you start attacking, either doublespends or block reorgs etc. \n\nIn the pow scenario you must fork away from the hash algorithim (For btc its sha256 eth is ethhash etc) you must do this because they can spend a relatively small amount of electricity to attack your chain once they have the asics.Also it takes time to notice attacks and organize a fork during which your chain will be unusable and asic miners will be desperately trying to avoid a fork unless there is no other choice. Note this basically bricks the asics because asics only work for one algorithm (This hurts the attacker and the honest good miners for a staggering amount of money) now you have the same chain but with a new algorithm. This means it can only be mined with cpus or gpus but likely gpus. Because it takes a long time to develop asics (At least a year likely longer) now the attacker buys or rents gpus (they may already have them if they plan this out for the sole purpose of attacking your chain) and they can relentlessly attack your chain because anything you fork to will also be mineable with the same general hardware. This is whats known as a spawn camp attack youll notice the attack is burning likely 10-20 B dollars(the asics will be bricks but afterwards the gpus or cpus have value so they are not sunk costs) which is alot for not much payoff and this is why POW has been secure so far. Not that no one could attack btc or eth (20B is not alot for say the US govt or chinese govt) but its not much of a threat yet to nationstates and they would be burning money for no reason.\n\nNow lets look at DPOS the attacker has begun attacking, censoring or reorging or whatever. Just like with pow you have to first notice an attack is happening and coordinate a fork.This will prove easier because first they can likely see on chain the malicious actors and can surgically target them and once the fork goes through honest stakers will not lose all their money so it will be much less contentious but it will still take a while. Once the fork goes through the attackers have lost nearly all their money and the honest stakers likely took a hit from the market turmoil but they will still have their tokens. Making additional attacks requires you to get another 10B or whatever amount worth of tokens again and attack again each time causing alot of pain for the chain but still burning all the attackers money so much better outcomes than POW and likely quicker resolutions as well.\n\nNow eth style POS Just like with before they start attacking. Only this time something very different occurs. Unlike other designs eth has slashing so in real time punishes malicous attackers by slashing thier stake. It is quadratic slashing as well meaning the harder they attack the chain (think attacking with 10% of the eth staked simultaneously vs 50+%) the more brutal the slashing. This can mean with an extreme attack scenario like I am describing now the attackers would pretty much instantly lose all of their stake, no fork coordination or programming necessary. This alone is a massive difference because it can turn an attack from a multi week massively controversial fork coordination every attack attempt into a absolutely brutal outcome for the attacker with only a moderate hiccup from the chain itself. But its even more asymmetrical than that. Eth has a limitation on the amount of new validators that can be on boarded (and exited) from the beacon chain at a time. This means in an attack scenario like this not only is the attack almost instantly thwarted and the attacker is out billions of dollars but arranging another attack will likely take over a year, if it can even be executed again (there may be too many new honest validators pouring in due to the staking apr surging after so much eth is destroyed that it could be literally impossible for the attacker to have another attempt)\n\nYou'll notice that the gap in attack scenarios is very large for all 3 security types and yet POW BTC and ETH have never really been attacked successfully. This is really what Justin Drake says when he means eth will have \"WW3 level security\". An attack on Eth after the merge wont just be difficult to execute or expensive like it currently is for BTC or ETH, it will be basically impossible even if the likes of the US or Chinese government were willing to set money on fire just to attack us. Even if an irrational actor with near infinite resources were to attack eth it will do little more than be a minor annoyance after the merge.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Basically eth style POS has slashing and this is massive for security.\nlets assume you are an attacker and are attacking three chains with identical economic security.

First they don't really have similar security at all. Economic security is the result (But not the same thing) of transaction fees and issuance. You can think of economic security as the cost to attack the chain and it is a result of consistent (consistent is very important for obvious and not so obvious reasons) payments to your miners or validators and the value of your token (In terms of marketcap) is directly proportional(But again not the same thing just correlated) to your security. Its kind of like the cost to attack a city(Economic security) is going to go up if you consistently pay mercenaries alot to guard it(Issuance and tx fees). More mercenaries will come they will be more loyal and better trained and just the fact that the city is so well guarded will deter an attack. Eventually if you are outbidding everyone consistently for security no one will dare to even think of attacking (US military or post POS ETH)\nAs Eth has a much higher marketcap than these other chains it can have higher security with less inflation.In order for a chain with 500M marketcap to have the same security as one with 1B it has to have double the inflation rate+tx fees. Since you can't really control transaction fees (They are determined by market demand and are highly volatile) this basically forces you to have double the issuance/inflation which is a vicious cycle that devalues your token.\n\nThis next part is key to understanding why ETH will likely dominate the blockchain space.
