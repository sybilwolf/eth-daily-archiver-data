I've been on vacation for the past week, planning to head home and get back in the groove in the next few days. I've had some time to unwind and think about my priorities - mostly to realize that the most pressing issue in our ecosystem right now is STILL client diversity. I hate this. To be honest, I'm a little over the fight, but we've got to keep pushing until we've protected the beacon chain from lazy and negligent actors. Around April 1, I'll start looking for the most up-to-date client diversity data I can find. I **DO** expect to see a healthy shift (I just looked at [pools.invis.cloud](https://pools.invis.cloud) and see some extremely encouraging data!) You may not want to hear this from me, but getting Prysm below 66% simply isn't good enough - we can't stop until no client is above 33%, it's really the only way to maximize the  benefit of multi-client architecture we've spent so much time and energy on. If you haven't read [Dankrad's latest post](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2022/03/24/run-the-majority-client-at-your-own-peril.html) I strongly encourage you to check it out.\n\nOn the heels of the client diversity struggle is the \"Entity size debate\", this is something I've wanted to kick down the road until we had client diversity resolved, but the gist of it is that we cannot allow any entity to exert governance control (or operate) more than 20% of the network. With one entity already exceeding this critical threshold, we have to begin addressing it now. The 20% number seems arbitrary, but I do believe it's well grounded in calculating the number of entities who can collude to break the chain - it should always be MORE than three, which suggests no entity should control more than 20% (Three entities with 22% is 66% of the network). You can see this illustrated very well at https://rated.network.\n\nI'm about to log out and finish my vacation, but I want to leave you with a final thought: This isn't my fight. I have been a loud voice, and I'm **SO** proud to see many others promoting the health of the network, but we need more. This has to be a charge led by the community - that's all of us. We need more people who are willing to make their voice heard, to tweet, message, create more tools and dashboards to bring this information to light. We have had a lot of people pushing the health of the network, but at this critical period (the merge/genesis of the beacon chain) we need all hands on deck. We tend to think of cryptocurrency/Ethereum as controlled by software, but that software only exists as a base layer of people. We are the network.\n\nThis week I've had a lot of time to relax and examine my priorities. I've wondered if my push for network health is worth it. Wondering if I'm wasting my time as a renegade crusader when I could be doing lots of other (more relaxing things) with my time. At the end of it, I believe network health is worth fighting for as long as there are others who are willing to stand with me. We are Layer 0.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all!

That means market makers, despite piling into indices recently, aren&#39;t full clits out risk-on bullish. IWM is struggling to get above the 50 fib pivot at 210. In fact earlier today it was dangling at the perilous 203 low of last week. Closing below that would be signs of a local top. But it recovered to just 206 thankfully.</li>\n<li>The housing market is still in a precarious place. Like small caps, it recovered today to close 419.86 but did test weekly lows at 414 earlier. Not every housing correction leads to a bear market, but every bear market is preceded by a housing correction. Eyes on.</li>\n<li>And the biggest one of all you&#39;re all sick of hearing about... bonds. The yield curve. Bonds are the largest, smartest market on Earth. Trillions. They are not convinced by this rise and the inversion is still looming. The 2-Yr is 0.123% from flipping the 10-Yr. For reference, it was like 0.85% just in January. The inversion has predicted every recession going back 100 years. BUT NOW READ THE NEXT BULLET.</li>\n<li>You don&#39;t read the yield curves like a derivative. An &quot;upcoming inversion&quot; is NOT an upcoming recession. Only the event is a predictor, not the lead up. It can drop, bounce away, disappear, and there will be no recession indicator. It&#39;s like the lottery -- being one number away from a winner is just as mathematically distant as all six or seven numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>QCCC?</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-28 13:38:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i2he4p0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tq1pfn","parent_id":"t3_tq1pfn","score":61,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Sick of seeing the message\n\n#YOU DIED\n\nAlready, huh?\n\nWelcome back! :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sick of seeing the message</p>\n\n<h1>YOU DIED</h1>\n\n<p>Already, huh?</p>\n\n<p>Welcome back! :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-28 14:24:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i2hkurh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tq1pfn","parent_id":"t1_i2he4p0","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"Never ;) Plus every one of them was worth it for -- ELDEN RING SPOILERS -- >!\"GOD SLAIN\"!<.\n\nThanks, friend.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Never ;) Plus every one of them was worth it for -- ELDEN RING SPOILERS -- <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">&quot;GOD SLAIN&quot;</span>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, friend.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-28 14:37:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i2hmiw7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tq1pfn","parent_id":"t1_i2hkurh","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/SabishiiFury","body":"Ahhh, now we're truly back","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ahhh, now we&#39;re truly back</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-28 13:54:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i2hgmxv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tq1pfn","parent_id":"t1_i2he4p0","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Papazio","body":"Are there any notable times that the big boss bond market has been wrong?

Looks like they are heavily subsidizing liquidity bootstrapping so prob a decent yielding farm spot in the immediate term. STG will prob get pumped for Alameda exit liquidity at some point so if you get off the ride in time might be fruitful. It's competing with all the other bridges like hop, the native L2 bridges, and others I'm sure I'm missing. As to what differentiates their technology from others, I will admit I haven't dug much deeper than the tokenomics.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Smells like an Alameda pump and dump.
