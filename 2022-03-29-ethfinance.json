The result is that there has been a lot of community talk on how to spread the word to diversify clients among validators. Included in that are other diversity goals - cloud hosted validators, large staking pools, physical validator locations. \n\nThat is where this type of diversity dashboard site comes in. Looking at ways to continue to spread the word as well as possibly bring in tangible goals to work towards decentralizing these clients. Without a way to track it's hard to give a visualization of the problem and even harder to see if all the effort is working.\n\nNow on to the details... from that post I offered up at least the service of trying to get some coordination going.

This is actually somewhat common practice these days--e.g. the Ribbon Protocol airdrop was claimable before RBN was transferrable (thus, you could claim and own RBN at your address--and even vote with it--but no one could transfer it or create a pool on Uniswap and price it until the DAO voted to unlock it).

For prices under this price the network is deflationary and for prices above is inflationary.</p>\n\n<p>As you correctly argue, the network cannot exist forever in the deflationary regime because then ETH starts becoming infinitely scarce until it disappears. And the only way of exiting the deflationary regime is by at least reaching the price given above. So what happens in the long term is that the burn makes ETH scarcer and scarcer, which results in a supply crunch that pushes the price of ETH upward until it exits the deflationary regime.</p>\n\n<p>You can find a spreadsheet calculating all this in detail in this post I made a few months ago: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum</a></p>\n\n<p>Check out the Monetary Model tab.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-29 09:18:24","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-03-29 12:11:52","id":"i2kxcg1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tqs71b","parent_id":"t1_i2kp1nf","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-29 08:37:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i2kqy14","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tqs71b","parent_id":"t1_i2kp1nf","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Aggravating-Ear6289","body":"even 1 eth is plenty, woth dollars and cents I think all the wealth in the world is like 10 to the 16","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>even 1 eth is plenty, woth dollars and cents I think all the wealth in the world is like 10 to the 16</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-29 09:10:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i2kw4ed","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tqs71b","parent_id":"t1_i2kqy14","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"You're right.\n\nPlus, let's say we have consistent negative issuance.

For the merge the difficulty bomb is the most important. PoW Ethereum will cease to exist, it has a deadline, the death of PoW Ethereum is codified in itself.

When the difficulty bomb kick in, at a minimum you have to push it forward which is by itself an active decision. This prevents staleness at the protocol level and kills the discourse of what is the canonical chain as there is no chain that can place itself as the most &quot;original&quot; one. But the users don&#39;t need to do what the devs want, they are free to implement different changes or even no changes except pushing or removing the difficulty bomb.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the merge, the opinion of the miners is irrelevant, and the utility of the difficulty bomb is a deadline for the devs after which the network will gradually stop working.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Absolutely disagree on this. For the merge the difficulty bomb is the most important. PoW Ethereum will cease to exist, it has a deadline, the death of PoW Ethereum is codified in itself. No one can claim they are PoW Ethereum after the merge. They are in the best case, something else that resembles Ethereum PoW which makes you not much different than the already existing Ethereum Classic.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-29 06:15:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i2k6gcg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tqs71b","parent_id":"t1_i2k4ojk","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"> So when it comes down to it, the difficulty bomb isn't really necessary any more.

For stability's sake it would still be better if the old PoW network would encounter a difficulty bomb immediately after the merge just to make sure that if someone wants to continue it, they have to fork at least one client to diffuse the bomb and agree upon using it. More likely they'll have to fork several ETH1 clients if they want even a semblance of support among services that depend on those clients.

Unfortunately it seems like my Reddit Recap is unobtainable, otherwise I could have shared the hours I spent here... If I recall correctly it was like 400+- hours or 16,5 days. Discovered so many amazing projects and protocols through the Daily via the big brains and degens in here. Illuvium, Rocket Pool, Treasure and Arbitrum (Ecosystem) to name a few. I think people with a certain attitude will end up here eventually, either by being tipped by one of us or by going deep in all things Ethereum!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-29 05:08:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i2jyvyq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tqs71b","parent_id":"t1_i2jgf9x","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Maswasnos","body":"I found it on the sidebar of /r/ethereum when I first started looking into ETH, also /r/ethtrader.
