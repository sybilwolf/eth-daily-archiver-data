This leads to all sorts of perverse incentives: even people who feel rational and clear-headed about it will always still subtly shift the narrative to be something that's believable or enticing to outsiders.  They'll also always be incentivized to defend their own beliefs and the actions of those whom they feel mostly heavily influence others' beliefs.  This includes discouraging competing beliefs, or hiding/rationalizing away inconsistencies.\n\nI didn't take profit motive from that post.

There are some neat ideas and tools in the space (signed ledgers are pretty neat), but as long as it has the \"currency\" part, it'll always be fraught with problems arising from people attempting to maximize profit/value at all costs.  This is especially true because people in the community who *aren't* as profit motivated are still incentivized to support those that are, because they've been convinced that if the profit motive fails, so too does the technology.\n\nYes, there's disinformation from competitors.

Some of the \"FUD\" is actually the fault of people who are guilty of speaking dishonestly in the positive direction, as well.  One good example of this is the \"EIP-1559 will/didn't lower fees\" problem; there were a whole lot of pro-EIP-1559 people spewing all sorts of garbage in favor of it to gather public support.  One of those bits of misinformation was that it would lower fees. People who disagreed were accused of being \"anti-EIP-1559\" and \"BTC maximalists\" and the like; so eventually the meme caught on.  Now that it hasn't lowered fees (and never was going to anyway), some fraction of those people who bring up that it *didn't* lower fees aren't actively trying to spread misinformation; they're simply repeating/questioning the information they were given.\n\n> Go through my posts and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find me admitting to ETH maximalism.

I did, however, take it from your lack of response and your subsequent comment on \"BTC maximalism\".\n\nUnlike others, I can sit here and admit profit motive is a big factor in a lot of people (probably most) and at least a minor factor in every single person. I have said in the past I'm not sure I'd have been as involved, both effort and length of time in the community, if there wasn't some money being made here. I don't hide that.\n\nI also think something the \"currency part ruins blockchain tech\" crowd forget is there has to be some way motivate miners / validators of a network. I don't really see how this can be done in an effectively decentralized manner without the profit motive. It's a 'deal with the devil' that is necessary for existence, if you will.\n\nOf course, I think sometimes you can take actions that lean far more alturistic(?, idk, lack of better word) then profit motivated time to time. Broadly, I've tried to do my best to help people understand the blockchain tech when I had the knowledge to assist. More specifically I've assisted people's understanding of how ETHE works for the sake of spreading knowledge. Yes I owned some, but it's not like I made commission on sales or really gave two shits if Grayscale succeeded. And I know nothing I said was 'pumping the price'. I've also helped be a proponent of EIP-1559. I'm not sure where you sit on it based on above, but I felt it was important to pass (and no, I'm not getting into a debate about that!). I'll stress I was absolutely not one of the \"it will lower fees\" people - often making posts to emphasize it won't, and only slightly so due to being more predictable - but I tried to emphasize the important of forcing transactions to be paid in ETH as well as the burn being a mechanism to prevent miner collusion. I was frustrative the narrative of \"lower fees\" got out...\n\nSo now I wanted to help with this small community project of gathering statistics on client diversity. I don't think it is fair for you to assume just because I didn't engage in that debate to think I'm solely profit motivated. Again, I simple can't get into huge debates **every single time** someone posts a contrarian opinion. I have a focused goal based on a belief I've come to accept for myself. I'm 110% open to ideas and influences in it, but a complete 180 on the project just isn't feasible.\n\n>I mean, as long as you're actively open to the possibility that you're wrong, that's an entirely respectable position to take.\n\nI can and will if that time comes. I've been wrong on a lot of blockchain things and I don't hide that.\n\n>But can you articulate why, or make a case for why the benefits outweigh the obvious downsides?\n\nAgain, I don't really want to get into this debate. It seems clearly your really pushing for it. So I'll dabble in it lightly to say this. I don't pretend it's not a tradeoff. I feel the benefits outweigh the tradeoffs. I think the single client failure state of a frozen blockchain is basically a catastrophic end state in a smart contract based platform due to the social cost. The trust would be gone. In the same way I'd hypothetically argue the redundancies in the modern automobiles brake systems (multiple reservoirs, a manual secondary emergency brake) are more expensive and complex BUT necessary because the failure state is 'unacceptable'.\n\nI'd also throw out an argument that I think makes me and you discussing this pointless - to maintain a permissionless and decentralized blockchain I simply can't argue for single-client use. From an ideological standpoint, I have no 'right' to say others can't create their own clients. Which is probably the inherent flaw of pushing for a single client system, right? How do you pick the winner? How do you say \"Teku, sorry... you can't work on that anymore do something else\"?\n\nKnowing that forcing a single client is against the ethos of blockchain (IMO), the next logical step is to push for the next best thing. A system where Pyrsm (or any client) is a large majority of clients is probably the worst thing you can have in a multi-client system. You have all the problems of a multi-client system you noted (notable, all efforts are not focused) with none of the benefits (if pyrsm at greater then 66% fails the network can still go to a halt.) So the next logical step is if we *have* to have a multiclient chain, it's best to keep it as diversified as possible.\n\nI'll also, also add (light, I said haha) a big part of the project was looking towards diversity factors that would apply to single client issues anyway. Say the multi-client diversity push 'fails' (idk, >80%,90% one client) there are still other diversity factors worth tracking that we were hoping to find. You wouldn't want Coinbase owning >50% of all staked ETH. You wouldn't want 50% of the valdiators located in one country due to potential regulation issues.

Point is, the fundamentals of what Ethereum, decentralization, and freedom [big fking caveat] can be are here. \n\nA few rules for me and anyone who cares to listen: don't divulge too much online, don't state how much you have, and try to be kind. We aren't all geniuses or wordsmiths. \n\nEvery day there are fewer posters reminding you of posterity and humility so keep your head on a swivel. The future of finance because of ETH is probably not likely but if you are here you will most likely be better off than anyone in TradFi (as well as WSB know it alls).\n\nWhen, and certainly not if but when, ETH gets to a minimum $20k there will be a lot of FOMO.

One of the metrics we are trying to work on how best to quantify is staking pool diversity. Not so much the clients they use themselves (as that is already fairly trackable on the whole) but at what levels do they become dangerous in terms of ownership of staked ETH? Especially when you start grouping them together --- what % is dangerous for the top 2 or 3 pools, or all pools? Should Coinbase be lumped in with Rockepool, and if not how do weigh them?
