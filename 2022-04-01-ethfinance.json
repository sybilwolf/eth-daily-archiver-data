Ether will, post-merge, feature an intrinsic yield.\nWhat Saylor \u2014 or any other high yield issuer \u2014 should do is issue debt and purchase ETH. This is a positive carry trade.</p>\n\n<p>There is a significant amount of money managers that would like to allocate to \u201ccrypto\u201d \u2014 by which they mean Bitcoin and or Ether \u2014 but the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism is considered energy wasteful. Crypto is therefore against their ESG mandate. [...] Sentiment will all change when ETH becomes an ESG-friendly, POS blockchain, which ESG funds can then invest in. This opens up ETH to hundreds of billions of USD worth of fiduciaries who due to ETH\u2019s classification, can now safely invest (as in the safety of their job, not their investors\u2019 capital).</p>\n\n<p>If you are a capital allocator who either already holds some of these coins, or has to choose which smart contract layer-1 coin to invest in, wouldn\u2019t you want to buy the cheapest one? While Ether\u2019s market cap is orders of magnitude larger than its competing chains, it is still cheap on a network funderrrmental valuation basis.\nAs the year progresses and the merge comes and goes, I expect ETH to significantly outperform any L1 chain that constructed a narrative that it is \u201cfaster and cheaper\u201d than Ethereum. That narrative worked from 2020 to the end of 2021, but now Ether supports extremely positive price fundamentals from a flow of and return on capital basis.</p>\n\n<p>When the dust settles at year-end, I believe ETH will be trading north of $10,000.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-01 01:41:42","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-01 01:45:41","id":"i2ykvyl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ttiqy2","parent_id":"t3_ttiqy2","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/-lightfoot","body":"Theres absolutely no way this guy isn\u2019t lurking this sub daily.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Theres absolutely no way this guy isn\u2019t lurking this sub daily.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-01 02:09:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i2ymtjv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ttiqy2","parent_id":"t1_i2ykvyl","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/alexiskef","body":"You are not fooling anyone Arthur..

Lets say the merge happens on the 1st of July. By comparing the current supply with the rate of issuance we can calculate an estimated peak supply of 119,244,293 ETH at the time of the merge.\r  \n\r\n\n[ETH supply at merge.](https://i.imgur.com/0R2wGPB.jpg)\n\nSimilarly, we can model the amount of ETH that will be staked at the time of the merge by projecting historical beacon chain data into the future. Since genesis, an average of 20,240 ETH has been staked per day. If we assume this rate stays steady into the future we can calculate an estimated amount of 12,352,492 ETH staked in the beacon chain deposit contract by the 1st of July (10.36% of total supply).\n\n[ETH staked in the deposit contract.](https://i.imgur.com/eNZcrYz.jpg)\n\nWe can also look at historical transaction fees paid on the EVM to forecast what future revenue might look like. Over the last 12 months Ethereum has generated 1,165,512 ETH in revenue. We can divide that by 365 to get an average daily revenue of 3,193 ETH per day.\n\n[ETH historical transaction fees.](https://i.imgur.com/dbbbLNn.jpg)\n\nNow if we use each of these assumptions together we can calculate the total expected staking APR immediately following the merge.\n\nUsing my assumptions I get the following:\n\n* Staking APR with issuance only: 4.73%\n* Staking APR with issuance plus fees: 8.52%\n* Normalised net income to stakers: 8.72%\n\n[ETH staking APR post merge.](https://i.imgur.com/penKSmv.jpg)\n\nBut what happens next?\n\nThe bears argue that as soon as withdrawals unlock there will be race to the exits as genesis stakers seek to sell their ETH to lock in profits. However, even if this did happen, it would only cause the staking APR to rise and incentivise more stakers to join the system.\n\nBut I for one don't think that many pre-merge stakers will be interested in abandoning an 8.5% staking APR. In fact I think it's much more likely that the total amount of ETH staked will continue to climb until a long-term equilibrium is established. \n\n[ETH long term issuance rate.](https://i.imgur.com/m1JoWIA.jpg)\n\nWhere this gets interesting is when we take a look at the [validator queue.](https://eth2-validator-queue.web.app/) This exists for security reasons, but it means that a flood of validators can't come into a system and leave immediately in a proof of stake model.\n\n[Ethereum has a rate limit set for the pace at which validators can join the network.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_MpFO5WYAQKGqq?format=jpg&name=medium) Right now, it takes about 11 days to become activated.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\n* When we merge the APY will shoot up as all transaction fees are routed from miners to stakers\n* A flood of users will rush to stake\n* The staking queue will fill up and will create a bottleneck limiting the speed that the staking APY can drop","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Let\u2019s talk about the ETH staking rate post-merge.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s possible to model what the supply of ETH will be at the time of the merge if we make a few assumptions.

By comparing the current supply with the rate of issuance we can calculate an estimated peak supply of 119,244,293 ETH at the time of the merge.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0R2wGPB.jpg\">ETH supply at merge.</a></p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we can model the amount of ETH that will be staked at the time of the merge by projecting historical beacon chain data into the future. Since genesis, an average of 20,240 ETH has been staked per day. If we assume this rate stays steady into the future we can calculate an estimated amount of 12,352,492 ETH staked in the beacon chain deposit contract by the 1st of July (10.36% of total supply).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eNZcrYz.jpg\">ETH staked in the deposit contract.</a></p>\n\n<p>We can also look at historical transaction fees paid on the EVM to forecast what future revenue might look like. Over the last 12 months Ethereum has generated 1,165,512 ETH in revenue. We can divide that by 365 to get an average daily revenue of 3,193 ETH per day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/dbbbLNn.jpg\">ETH historical transaction fees.</a></p>\n\n<p>Now if we use each of these assumptions together we can calculate the total expected staking APR immediately following the merge.</p>\n\n<p>Using my assumptions I get the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Staking APR with issuance only: 4.73%</li>\n<li>Staking APR with issuance plus fees: 8.52%</li>\n<li>Normalised net income to stakers: 8.72%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/penKSmv.jpg\">ETH staking APR post merge.</a></p>\n\n<p>But what happens next?</p>\n\n<p>The bears argue that as soon as withdrawals unlock there will be race to the exits as genesis stakers seek to sell their ETH to lock in profits. However, even if this did happen, it would only cause the staking APR to rise and incentivise more stakers to join the system.</p>\n\n<p>But I for one don&#39;t think that many pre-merge stakers will be interested in abandoning an 8.5% staking APR. In fact I think it&#39;s much more likely that the total amount of ETH staked will continue to climb until a long-term equilibrium is established. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/m1JoWIA.jpg\">ETH long term issuance rate.</a></p>\n\n<p>Where this gets interesting is when we take a look at the <a href=\"https://eth2-validator-queue.web.app/\">validator queue.</a> This exists for security reasons, but it means that a flood of validators can&#39;t come into a system and leave immediately in a proof of stake model.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_MpFO5WYAQKGqq?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\">Ethereum has a rate limit set for the pace at which validators can join the network.</a> Right now, it takes about 11 days to become activated.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this mean?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When we merge the APY will shoot up as all transaction fees are routed from miners to stakers</li>\n<li>A flood of users will rush to stake</li>\n<li>The staking queue will fill up and will create a bottleneck limiting the speed that the staking APY can drop</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-01 09:37:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i3034dj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ttiqy2","parent_id":"t3_ttiqy2","score":30,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/baggygravy","body":"It does indeed seem like this is where we're heading, I agree with your take in general and the assumption that staking will continue to be more attractive than exiting; it's a fascinating dynamic.
