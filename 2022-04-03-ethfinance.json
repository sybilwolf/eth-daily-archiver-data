This may mean that some people who are currently using infura will need to switch to a local geth, besu, erigon, or nethermind node before the merge, and they might even need to get more ssd space to host this local execution client. At this time we are aware that geth is responsible for 100% of blocks proposed on mainnet, we do look forward to people running besu, erigon, and nethermind, but we acknowledge these clients aren't as hardened as geth. With that said, ALL diversity benefits the network, so you could be part of the brave savior minority if you're running another client and geth faults.\n\nSimplified understanding:\n\n**Execution Clients** (Referred to as \"EL\" clients, Eth1 clients)\n\n* geth - the most well-known client, running since around 2015, currently responsible for ~100% of block proposals.\n* besu - developed by Consensus, I'd suggest it's the second most-developed client, but this is a personal opinion and it may be incorrect. Note that Besu and Teku are both part of Consensus and likely have higher interoperability than some other combinations. Besu also has advanced pruning that isn't yet available in geth, this means you can prune the size of your execution client without going offline.\n* nethermind - Built on .NET, in development since 2018. I don't have much personal experience with it, but that shouldn't discourage you from trying it and telling everyone about it.\n* erigon - forked from geth, erigon was originally known as \"turbo-geth\" and focuses on being a faster, lighter client.\n\nI'd highly suggest [this ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) reference for a better-developed description of these clients. People often ask me why I push so hard for Consensus Layer diversity but not as hard for Execution Layer diversity. I can't give a perfect answer to that, except to say that the consensus layer clients are all hardened to the same level, while the execution layer clients still vary significantly in maturity. I do intend to push EL diversity in the coming weeks/months.\n\n**Consensus Clients** (Referred to as \"CL\" clients, Eth2 clients)\n\n* prysm - formerly a supermajority client and still over-represented on the network\n\n* lighthouse - written in Rust, the second most popular client.

This may mean that some people who are currently using infura will need to switch to a local geth, besu, erigon, or nethermind node before the merge, and they might even need to get more ssd space to host this local execution client. At this time we are aware that geth is responsible for 100% of blocks proposed on mainnet, we do look forward to people running besu, erigon, and nethermind, but we acknowledge these clients aren&#39;t as hardened as geth. With that said, ALL diversity benefits the network, so you could be part of the brave savior minority if you&#39;re running another client and geth faults.</p>\n\n<p>Simplified understanding:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Execution Clients</strong> (Referred to as &quot;EL&quot; clients, Eth1 clients)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>geth - the most well-known client, running since around 2015, currently responsible for ~100% of block proposals.</li>\n<li>besu - developed by Consensus, I&#39;d suggest it&#39;s the second most-developed client, but this is a personal opinion and it may be incorrect. Note that Besu and Teku are both part of Consensus and likely have higher interoperability than some other combinations. Besu also has advanced pruning that isn&#39;t yet available in geth, this means you can prune the size of your execution client without going offline.</li>\n<li>nethermind - Built on .NET, in development since 2018.

When I had made this my goal as a little kid, my family had simply balked at me for ridiculous ideas.\n\nMore so than my capabilities, the simple exposure to certain information & resources made this possible for me, and that there are millions of unrealized, insanely talented people out there in the world. Humanity is missing out on value creation because we can't get resources effectively distributed and this is not a zero-sum game.\n\nI have been discussing with some friends the idea of a way to align incentives and make more available scholarships, resources for such kids and I believe solution can lie in Eth in some way.
