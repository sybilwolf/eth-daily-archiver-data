Change is going to be dynamic, which means that the way we regulate crypto technologies needs to be dynamic too (just as it should be for other financial activities and products).  \n>  \n>We shouldn't be thinking of regulation as a static, rigid thing. Instead, we should be thinking in terms of regulatory code, (like computer code), which we refine and rewrite when we need to. Tailored and proportionate, yes, but also nimble and tech neutral... Shaped by your input and advice... And with the treasury and regulators, (through the Crypto Assets Task Force), working together to create a dynamic regulatory landscape, which works for everyone.  \n>  \n>I am very aware of recent reporting on the temporary regime. This is a new world. The newly regulated and the regulated need to work together, learn from each other, to maintain those high standards while being flexible and working at the pace that the speed of innovation demands.  \n>  \n>We consulted last year on how to regulate the so called stablecoins, which some companies are keen to develop for payment purposes. Today, we are publishing our response. **I can confirm we will be legislating to bring certain stablecoins into our payments framework, creating the conditions for stablecoin issuers and service providers to operate and grow in the UK.** This will also enable consumers to use stablecoin payment services with confidence. The government will introduce this legislation as part of an ambition to deliver a world-leading regulation regime for stablecoins.  \n>  \n>We wanted, in the first instance, to focus on areas of immediate potential and concern in the crypto-sphere (hence, our work on stablecoins). We are now widening the gaze. We think the market has changed sufficiently for us to look at regulating a broader set of crypto activities, including trading of tokens like bitcoin. We will consult on a world-leading regime for the rest of the crypto market too. A regime that will facilitate safe, sustainable, and rapid innovation.  \n>  \n>Looking ahead, the legal landscape will also be crucial. English law, and our world-leading legal services and courts, are already a huge asset. They can play a big part in making the UK an attractive hub for all things digital (and for new technologies more generally).  \n>  \n>I want to thank the law commission for all of the work that they've done on digital assets and smart contracts. **I'm delighted to announce that we are asking them to undertake a new project: to consider the legal status of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.**  \n>  \n>These projects are helping ensure that we remain at the cutting edge of legal innovation. Just as we did with Limited Liability Companies in the 19th century and the legal framework for derivatives and securitization markets in the 1990s. English law can (and should) provide the legal foundation for the use of these borderless technologies.  \n>  \n>All of this activity is happening against a backdrop of exciting and transformative innovation. Around the next evolution of the internet: Web3. No one knows for sure yet, how Web3 is going to look. There's every chance that blockchain is going to be integral to its development, with a more decentralized, open, and user-owned ecosystem. We want this country to be there leading from the front. Seeking out the greatest economic opportunities. The government is already working with digital regulators to understand what issues will need to be considered in order to achieve maximum benefit for the public.  \n>  \n>We will also be engaging with you all closely on changes we want to make to the tax system. On balance, we don't think the tax code will need major surgery to make it work more easily for crypto. **We're going to look at and resolve specific issues, like the treatment of DeFi loans and staking. We'll also be amending the investment manager exemption to remove disincentives to UK fund managers (including disincentives to UK fund managers including crypto assets in their portfolios.)** Above all, we want to position the UK as a pro-innovation jurisdiction which is attractive to inward investment and to firms who don't yet have a settled base.  \n>  \n>The second thing we have going for us is that we are determined to learn quickly. The UK already has a strong track record of facilitating experimentation through the FCA's regulated sandbox, which has supported more than 50 firms using blockchain. **The FCA has announced today that they will be organizing the first of a series of crypto sprints next month (involving scores of industry experts).** These sprints will inform FCA policy thinking in real time. Participants will be tasked with wrangling some of the legal, technical, and regulatory challenges the industry faces. And then coming up with practical solutions, which we (the government) will take forward as quickly as we can.  \n>  \n>We will also deliver the financial market infrastructure sandbox which the chancellor announced last year (and on which we are making very good progress). The sandbox, to be run by the Bank of England and the FCA, will allow firms to experiment and innovate in providing the services that underpin markets. In particular, this will enable them to test new technologies that could transform financial markets by delivering greater efficiency, improve liquidity, enhance transparency, and greater security. We intend to have this up and running next year. If it teaches us that we need to update the relevant legislation, then we will do that too.  \n>  \n>**We will also be establishing a high-level industry group, the Crypto Asset Engagement Group, to help guide us on the next steps in the road ahead.** A direct, open channel of communication chaired at ministerial level with senior representatives from the FCA, the Bank of England, as well as from business. It will meet up to eight times per year and will have a full and proactive agenda. Not just talk... Talk, then determined, concrete action, informing and accelerating work being done elsewhere (including by regulators).  \n>  \n>Our third and final crucial advantage is the leading role the government is going to play. Unlike the EU and the US, the UK has a small number of regulators. Central government sets the overall framework and can take decisive action, so we can move very nimbly. Trust me, we have a determined, unified, single-minded government that is going to prioritize this. **For instance, we'll be undertaking a program of work to explore whether it's possible to apply DLT to the debt issuance process. Could the UK, one day, issue a debt instrument using DLT? I don't yet know the answer, but let's find out.** We will lead by example. We are already effectively using crypto technologies to make government more efficient. We're developing opportunities to use distributed ledger technology for customs and international trade (to ease the import of goods). We will continue to support further opportunities to deploy that technology.  \n>  \n>**Finally, I'm announcing today that the chancellor has asked the royal mint to create a non-fungible token, an NFT, to be issued by the summer.** An emblem of the forward looking approach that we are determined to take. There'll be more details available very soon.\n\n\\-John Glen, Economic Secretary to the Treasury \\[04/04/2022\\]\n\nThanks u/Yeopaa for somehow finding this [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wS54Hy7ujk) with only 65 views.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Our view is that crypto is going to impact many different sectors (including financial services).

On balance, we don&#39;t think the tax code will need major surgery to make it work more easily for crypto. <strong>We&#39;re going to look at and resolve specific issues, like the treatment of DeFi loans and staking. We&#39;ll also be amending the investment manager exemption to remove disincentives to UK fund managers (including disincentives to UK fund managers including crypto assets in their portfolios.)</strong> Above all, we want to position the UK as a pro-innovation jurisdiction which is attractive to inward investment and to firms who don&#39;t yet have a settled base.  </p>\n\n<p>The second thing we have going for us is that we are determined to learn quickly. The UK already has a strong track record of facilitating experimentation through the FCA&#39;s regulated sandbox, which has supported more than 50 firms using blockchain. <strong>The FCA has announced today that they will be organizing the first of a series of crypto sprints next month (involving scores of industry experts).</strong> These sprints will inform FCA policy thinking in real time. Participants will be tasked with wrangling some of the legal, technical, and regulatory challenges the industry faces. And then coming up with practical solutions, which we (the government) will take forward as quickly as we can.  </p>\n\n<p>We will also deliver the financial market infrastructure sandbox which the chancellor announced last year (and on which we are making very good progress). The sandbox, to be run by the Bank of England and the FCA, will allow firms to experiment and innovate in providing the services that underpin markets. In particular, this will enable them to test new technologies that could transform financial markets by delivering greater efficiency, improve liquidity, enhance transparency, and greater security. We intend to have this up and running next year. If it teaches us that we need to update the relevant legislation, then we will do that too.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>We will also be establishing a high-level industry group, the Crypto Asset Engagement Group, to help guide us on the next steps in the road ahead.</strong> A direct, open channel of communication chaired at ministerial level with senior representatives from the FCA, the Bank of England, as well as from business. It will meet up to eight times per year and will have a full and proactive agenda. Not just talk... Talk, then determined, concrete action, informing and accelerating work being done elsewhere (including by regulators).  </p>\n\n<p>Our third and final crucial advantage is the leading role the government is going to play. Unlike the EU and the US, the UK has a small number of regulators. Central government sets the overall framework and can take decisive action, so we can move very nimbly. Trust me, we have a determined, unified, single-minded government that is going to prioritize this. <strong>For instance, we&#39;ll be undertaking a program of work to explore whether it&#39;s possible to apply DLT to the debt issuance process. Could the UK, one day, issue a debt instrument using DLT? I don&#39;t yet know the answer, but let&#39;s find out.</strong> We will lead by example. We are already effectively using crypto technologies to make government more efficient. We&#39;re developing opportunities to use distributed ledger technology for customs and international trade (to ease the import of goods). We will continue to support further opportunities to deploy that technology.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally, I&#39;m announcing today that the chancellor has asked the royal mint to create a non-fungible token, an NFT, to be issued by the summer.</strong> An emblem of the forward looking approach that we are determined to take. There&#39;ll be more details available very soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-John Glen, Economic Secretary to the Treasury [04/04/2022]</p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"/u/Yeopaa\">u/Yeopaa</a> for somehow finding this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wS54Hy7ujk\">livestream</a> with only 65 views.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-04 13:16:41","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-04 16:39:36","id":"i3ebjby","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tvtsa9","parent_id":"t3_tvtsa9","score":59,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Yeopaa","body":"Filtered Youtube by posts from the last 24hrs. \ud83d\ude01","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Filtered Youtube by posts from the last 24hrs. \ud83d\ude01</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-04 13:20:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i3ec4pu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tvtsa9","parent_id":"t1_i3ebjby","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/cptnobvs3","body":"This is huge","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is huge</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-04 14:44:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i3epago","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tvtsa9","parent_id":"t1_i3ebjby","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/KuDeTa","body":"Thanks for posting this!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for posting this!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-04 14:40:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i3eoqwn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tvtsa9","parent_id":"t1_i3ebjby","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/-lightfoot","body":"New clientdiversity.org published\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/tv1fg8/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2022/i3b06px/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3\n\nPrysm now down to 54%!

They clearly have not, and are still sitting under 1% most of the time. A surprising amount of capital has been just dumped there and left to sit regardless of what else is going on in Defi. There is $5B in ETH on Aave mainnet alone earning sub 1% despite common Cefi lending options at 5%, staking APR at 4% (soon to be higher with the merge), various LP options including single-sided LPing with Bancor at 4%. Is Aave really that much less risky than wstETH or rETH? Why accept the lower returns? Is this going to self-correct over time when staking withdrawals are here?\n\nI actually suspect not. I think part of the answer to this mystery at present and increasingly in the future is that other protocols are going to use Aave and Compound as a parking place for idle capital. Bancor for example is launching their \"infinity pools\" that park idle capital in \"strategies\" such as Aave. Balancer is following a similar approach. It seems to be the growing alternative to the compressed liquidity ranges of Uniswap v3 for capital efficiency. What I'm getting at here is there is a large pile of ETH sitting in Aave at irrationally low borrow rates because people putting it there have reasons for putting it there *at any APR*. It seems silly for us to be able to borrow ETH at 1%, sell it for rETH at 4% and profit from the spread but that's where we're at.\n\nSo how do we profit from this market inefficiency? Up until recently the best you could do to capitalize on this inefficiency was deposit some unproductive asset like UNI or MKR to collect the spread yield on staking income vs borrow rates. The problem with that approach was the liquidation risk of whatever else you're using as collateral. If the UNI/ETH price crashes enough you lose your UNI while getting at most 3% here. So you up the collateralization ratio to 200-300% which means the actual yield falls to 1.5% or less. Basically, while it was minorly profitable, unless you were pushing around $100k or more of equity with this approach it just wasn't worth the gas/risk/headache.\n\nRecently though, Aave added wstETH as collateral. This... changes the game. This removes the liquidation risk, allows us to crank up the leverage on that rate spread trade, and go really long on the difference between the staking yield and the borrow rate.\n\n[stETH on Aave](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&marketName=proto_mainnet) has a max LTV of 70% and liquidation threshold of 75%. For those not familiar with Aave this means is if you deposit $1 of stETH you can borrow up $.70 of ETH. Using the same flash loan machinery as [The Double Logris](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-double-logris) you can get over a 3x leverage on this in one transaction. This of course means you can roughly triple your stETH yield in one transaction, going 3x long on the wstETH/ETH ratio and capitalizing on the irrationally low ETH borrow rates I discussed above.\n\nFor each stETH you have, you borrow 2 ETH on a flash loan, trade it for ~2 stETH, deposit 3 stETH (and earn the yield on it), borrow 2 ETH using your 3 stETH as collateral, and repay the flash loan. For the sake of demonstration, let's say stETH makes 4% APR and the ETH borrow rate is 1% APR. Your costs are 1% on 2 ETH borrow. Your profit is 4% on 3 stETH. Your net yield is ~10% on your original 1 stETH. Now, when the merge hits and the tips all go to stakers and the [staking yield goes to 8%](http://tokenomicsexplained.com/rpl) you'd be making 22% APR. Denominated in ETH.\n\nNow you can do this yourself using Defisaver Recipe Books (/u/nikola_j) or if you want a fully managed implementation of this approach you should have a look at [ETHMAXY](https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/0x0fe20e0fa9c78278702b05c333cc000034bb69e2). They take a 2% streaming fee to wrap this whole process into an ERC-20 for you and releverage the position occasionally as profit rolls in.\n\nThe downside risk is if the borrowing rates for ETH normalize to a more sane level. This position is basically 3x long the yield delta between staking and aave borrow. If this spread diminishes as it should then you'll be better off in my [Logris Vaults](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/tgul2p/daily_general_discussion_march_18_2022/i152i74/) where you'll conveniently get double yield on your rETH or stETH doing leveraged farming with Alchemix.\n\nIf this is something you think you'll want to refer back to let me know and I can turn it into a blog post on my site.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Prior to the beacon chain I expected that the borrow rates on money markets like Compound and Aave would normalize to something closer to the staking reward rate APR.

In order for the interest rate to be arbed up, you need sufficient collateral to borrow enough Eth to be profitable. But what are you borrowing that Eth against? Borrowing against USD is always risky, as even if you're not short ETH per se it still takes some time to move things around if you need to cover.
