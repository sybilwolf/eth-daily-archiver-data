All the while, centralizers are making progress every day. It's a bit like whack-a-mole where there's always a new centralization vector. Our current issue is that we believed Rocket Pool would take a chunk of the market share from Lido, and while Rocket Pool is performing very well, Lido is taking on deposits more quickly than anyone can keep up with... and Rocket Pool is desperately short of node operators. If you're not aware, the lion-share of new deposits in the beacon chain queue are being spun up by Lido. Mounting an information campaign with Lido as a target is a lot different than educating about client diversity.. with client diversity, everyone wins, no one is making enemies, but targeting an extremely profitable business in the name of decentralization is a fast-track to pissing people off. If you know me at all, I really hate conflict. I mostly tackle the jobs that have unanimous support, so I'm not really inclined to do battle with a very wealthy company. In the beginning of the beacon chain, we pushed home-based solo-staking as hard as we could. We waited anxiously for Rocket Pool to arrive so people could stake on a decentralized platform with less than 32 Ether, but all the while, people are dumping their coins into centralized providers hoping for easy profit. Right now, the [two largest staking providers](https://www.rated.network/) control 40% of the validators on the Ethereum mainnet. This isn't the model that the beacon chain was designed for, but it's where we are now. I eluded to feeling discouraged at the beginning of this ramble, but the truth is, I'm not really discouraged, I'm just kind of taking a broad view to realize that the success of Ethereum will be built on people who are vigilant for decentralization, but it takes more than the ten or twenty voices we have now.. it will take a thousand voices. I'm kind of hoping that some folks who read this will catch fire and recognize that the best way they can impact the future of Ethereum is to become warriors for decentralization.. and if you don't, that's cool.. maybe we'll get another chance to do something like this again in the future. Make no mistake: Ethereum and decentralized finance on an immutable blockchain is an experiment - this experiment can fail if we don't will it to succeed.

On average, it takes about a year past the inversion for the top to arrive. Shortest is about six months and longest is over two years. That's because the inversion -- the downslope on a 10Y minus 2Y chart -- isn't when the sell-off begins; the top appears when the yield curve rips back upwards and steeply.

And we'll want to be watching for severity, which tends to be decided by *how long* the inversion lasts. By that, I mean how long the whiplash back and forth above the 0 line lasts because, again, the curve is as I type this back positive but won't likely remain there. Covid was a quick dip and rip -- two monthly candles inverted and hardly a recession, one that was technically a recession that no one in equities noticed.

Silver linings, millennials.\n\nAnd as I wrote before I stepped away to clear my head, the [small caps IWM](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sM5mAVwb/) was. not. following the rest of the market.
