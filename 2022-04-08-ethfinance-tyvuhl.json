Played fake stock game with friends in college.  $6mm/6 months to see who would make the best investments.  I was a Tesla bull at $28 because I'm a gearhead and the auto press was calling the Model S complete vaporware.  But we were in Santa Monica and I was starting to see upwards of 3-4 Model S per day.  Seemed like a no brainer to me.  My other friend was just starting to dabble in real stocks and having success in WEED and CNBS so he focused his fake millions on stuff like that.  The third friend was an accounting major and a math genius in my mind.  He went for the standard finance approach, looking for companies based on traditional, conservative investing methods.  You know; *Technical Analysis.*  I preferred my Intelligent Investor approach of keeping to my lane and investing in what I know the best.  I was so confident I would beat them both that I only put half my fake money into TSLA, and I'm lazy so my primary goal was to find one unicorn and then set it and forget it.  Same reason I still love March Madness brackets and can't stand fantasy sports to this day.\n\nThe website we used to manage the game and pull real stock prices had a cryptocurrency section.  In high school I tried to mine bitcoin when it first became known to the online tech forums.  I stopped trying after a night when I (proudly at the time) calculated the electricity cost of powering the PC versus the amount of bitcoin I'd mine at 30BTC/$1 at the time [big life regret #1].  My dad would have killed me using that power *and* the shared family laptop 24/7.\n\nSo I had heard of crypto, at least in the form of BTC.  I thought that would be a good place to set my extra fake $3mm.  But to my surprise BTC was now trading at something like $250.  I couldn't buy as much as I had hoped; but that was the first sign in my life that I should pay attention to crypto.  It was no longer the internet pseudo-money I read about on Gizmodo in 2009.  It had real demand.\n\nBut I didn't yet know why.  And there were other crypto currencies on the website.  \"Monero\" and \"Ethereum\".  *Ethereum*.  That sounded cool to me.  That sounded like something from the Matrix mixed with Diablo.  In my mind, Ethereum sounded like the dark web version of bitcoin.  The one for real hackers and black markets.  Bitcoin at the time was mainly used for buying drugs on Silk Road.  Being a college student, I at least knew that\u2014 but didn't trust the concept of Silk Road at all, so never needed BTC.  My logic was Ethereum must be even more powerful as a dark web money since it was clearly less well known; and the name Ethereum sounded as grand and innovative as \"The Internet\" itself.  \n\nIt was also trading at $0.40 so I could (virtually) buy a shit ton.  So that's where the other $3mm went.\n\nAs expected I beat them both with TSLA.  But to all of our surprise, my Eth gains beat the TSLA gains.  I won twice over with zero management and just two trades.  During the course of that game I made my phone's browser's homepage ethereumprice.org and I essentially left it that way for the next few years.\n\nIt wasn't however until a couple years later that I would really concern myself with ethereum again, despite seeing the price every day.  The price hit $14; and the price $1.40 stuck out in my memory from the time of the fake stock game.  10x.  That had my attention.  The job I had at the time was exceptionally boring and draconian in management.  I had free time but could not show it.  No youtube or music or Reddit.  So I read a lot of wikipedia and random text articles I could paste into Notepad.  One day I thought to look into Ethereum.  I came across the whitepaper and that day became seared into my brain forever.\n\nThe idea of preforming useful computations in line with the mining process used to secure the network was a eureka moment for me.  I knew at that moment Vitalik is a genius.  In hindsight the idea is so obvious it's akin to drawing power from running water.  There is no going back; humanity is forever changed.  And then to make it Turing Complete out the gate... *It's nuclear fusion*.\n\nHowever, it was still a bubble to me.  I quickly lost site in the value of bitcoin, even then during the digital cash era.  It just seemed redundant when Ethereum was there.  I felt that digital cash was unnecessary when Ethereum allowed us to barter in computational work\u2014 the closest analog to dealing in pure energy units we've ever had.  By this time I had started shilling Ethereum's radical utopic potentials to my weed stocks friend.  This went on for months; meanwhile I was laid off from my current job.  I had started lurking /ethereum and /ethtrader and eventually posting.  Arguing for $10mm/Eth and electric blimps that pay for charging themselves using built-in Eth wallets.  I saw the wisdom of JT and DC and even the occasional  comment by Vitalik himself.  But now my excuse was being jobless and having dwindling savings and student loans.  One night my friend convinced me to grab a Guinness at the local spot and he broke the news; he had bought Ether.  He said it was easy now thanks to Coinbase and I had him convinced.  And that it was time I put my money where my mouth is.\n\nFuck, he was right.  I'd been talking about it so long and the price of it *and* bitcoin just kept going up.  I didn't want to miss it.  I signed up for Coinbase that night and 2 business days later bought my first .15 Eth.  Having been reading the great advice here I quickly set up weekly buys and just ignored it for a while.\n\nEventually I got to a point where I started buying more on some dips but that's pretty much been it.  I've played with DeFi and NFTs a bit but have kept that \"investment\" to about 3-5% of my Ethereum holdings.  It's more to keep me well versed in Web3 and to support the network beyond just holding Ether.\n\nMy next big move is to solo stake.  I'm just not in a position of stable enough housing to do so in my opinion.  I'd like to own a place before I set up a staking node.  I want to make sure it has power redundancies and all that.\n\nAnyway, thanks to anyone that read that shit.

To my wife's dismay, I packed my bag last night at like 1am I think. Lots of memories flooding back to the first time I visited Oahu and that experience. So I don't know how many people are visiting the beautiful Hawaiian Islands for the first time, but I decided to give y'all Aloha-noobs a list of tips & pointers that may help you.\n\n1.\tIf it seems like no one wants you there, it's because they don't. Kill them with kindness and patience. If you don't, you're gonna have a bad time. They only put up with you for your money, don't be an asshole about that fact.\n\n2.\t**DO NOT LITTER.** Seriously don't even let a gum wrapper accidentally fall out of your pocket. Don't spit gum out anywhere but a trash! Hawaiians are serious about trash and their environment, and rightfully so. I am not joking when I say: I will personally scream ***LITTERER!*** and point at you myself. Don't F up paradise.\n\n3.\tIf you smoke, you're basically a leper there. No judgement here, but I'm sorry. They will make you smoke 200 feet away from the building in the sun where all the birds sit on the powerlines so its covered in poop. This sucks, but don't let them catch you smoking anywhere else, ESPECIALLY the beach. Put your butts in a trash can after you are sure they're extinguished. Nicotine gum maybe? Juul?\n\n4.\tIf you smoke, bring your own, because they are EXPENSIVE and the cashier will give you a lot of really dirty looks. Then they'll smile when they say \"$21.75\" as they hand you a single pack of Reds.\n\n5.\tLeave the \"Hawaiian\" shirt at home. No matter what anyone tells you, it doesn't look good on you. Buy one from a local to wear at home though, they're damn comfortable.\n\n6.\tHawaiians do like to adorn their clothes and even design their own clothes. So if you wear a shirt with logos or Butter facts, expect people to talk to you. This is a great way to meet people and break the ice. So you know .. wear the \"Save the whales\" shirt instead of the \"F y'all I'm from Texas\" shirt.\n\n7.\tHonolulu, especially in the Waikiki area, is a big city. Lots of people, lots of traffic, no land mass to expand roads. If possible, avoid renting a car. If you need to go a distance, support a local Lyft or Uber driver.\n\n8.\tIf you must rent a car, don't rent the classic Mustang \"tourist edition\" convertible. Everyone will know you are a tourist. It also rains off and on a lot and the sun is hotter than 1000 suns down there. You will never use it anyway. Its a dream Magnum PI, leave it there.\n\n9.\tIf you're a Masochist and decide to drive anyway, dodge wildlife in the road like your life depends on it. Hawaiians value a squirrels life as much as a humans. In my first trip there I watched a man almost kill himself to avoid hitting a chicken in the road (they run wild there), but he still hit it. He stopped the car in the road, got out, then got down on his knees and cried. After a minute, he picked it up and buried it at the side of the road with his bare hands. With his car parked, running in the middle of the road! F'ing amazingly heartbreaking and I spent pretty much the whole rest of the vacation questioning my own humanity.\n\n10. Spend at least 1 day (hopefully more) of your vacation outside of Honolulu. The other sides of the island have a slower pace of life, it's beautiful, the locals are a bit more friendly, and you can support true Hawaiian owned businesses. Also everything is cheaper there.\n\n11. Go hiking outside Waikiki, I recommend [Manoa Falls Trail.](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/manoa-falls-trail?u=i) It's short & easy enough that it won't kill you if you're not in the best shape, and you get to see some beautiful water falls. Get up before the sun though, it gets busy. Bring water. Like 10X what you think you'll need.\n\n12. Take time to catch a sunset. No joke, they're bucket list worthy. The most amazing sunsets I have ever seen. It just hits different there. Skip \"Sunset Beach\" and go to \"Kualoa Beach\" on the west side of the island or the \"China Walls at Koko Kai Mini Beach.\" China walls require a moderately demanding hike to get to, but *SOOOO* worth the effort. Unabated, panoramic views of the sunset over the ocean. Don't go telling everyone about this one, I don't want it to get too popular. I had to get this Hawaiian dude, Mano, really drunk to find out about it. Drinks aren't cheap there and he weighed like 450lbs (204kg).\n\n13. If your skin is translucent like mine, wear sun screen. Like SPF6000. Put it on every day, many times a day. I'm deadly serious \ud83d\ude10. I have never blistered from being in the sun for just an hour, until Hawaii. Actually, it doesn't matter what color your skin is, wear it. **MAKE SURE YOUR SUNSCREEN IS REEF SAFE, THEY WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE IT IN TO THE STATE IF IT'S NOT.** You can always buy it there as well.\n\n14. BRING SUNGLASSES. I don't even think they should be optional here. You will go blind within day of being here if you don't.\n\n15. On the flight there and back they make you declare certain items like if you were traveling internationally. Nothing much to say here, it just threw me off a little. It's like a little micro-nation state.\n\n16. I know its mostly an American thing but if you are not an American, PLEASE. TIP. ALL. SERVICE. STAFF. EXTREMELY. WELL. If someone does something for you, give them money. This isn't the time to be a cheapass. MINIMUM 15% on meals (really more ya scrooge) and other skilled service people (drivers, tour guides, etc...) Yes, even the guy that drives the Airport shuttle bus, toss him a fiver.\n\n17. Even if you're not American, you should visit Pearl Harbor and take the tour. They put you on a boat and take you out to some old ship wrecks and stuff. It's an educational, enlightening and humbling experience no matter who you are.\n\n18. If you treat me like a lady, I might be a really crappy tour guide for you. I'm classy though, so beware.\n\n19. LASTLY! Be friendly, talk to people in the elevator, ask how people are they're doing when you uncomfortably make eye contact on the street. Comment on their shirts. Try and make them laugh, Hawaiians have a great sense of humor. This ain't New York City! You're in M'F'ing Hawaii man! Paradise on earth! Act like it! Just be respectful, you're a guest!\n\nHope this helps someone..","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Since I got back from vacation with my ever lasting love, all I can think about is Holdercon.

The fact that there were more NFTs produced in 2021 than 2020 suggests that earlier NFTs will always be more likely to pump, statistically speaking. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They are not like shitcoins, their history makes them different</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many are tbh. One random NFT has just as much history as a random 2017 shitcoin.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-08 03:33:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i3vsl6f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tyvuhl","parent_id":"t1_i3v74kw","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/jamelza11","body":"Woo I made it into the club!
