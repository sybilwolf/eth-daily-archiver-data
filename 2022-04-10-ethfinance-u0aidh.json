Whether that is a gap in knowledge or laziness/disinterest in learning, they shouldn't be shunned from participating.\n\nYour write up is phenomenal. The only addition I would make is for 2FA to prioritize using a Yubikey and make sure it secures your email. This way if your phone is lost/stolen, you won't have given a near master key away, though a password manager like LastPass or similar will keep you very, very safe. Just make sure never to forget or lose the master password that secures that.\n\nQuickly on password managers: The way the vast majority work is the password you use to access the passwords is also used to encrypt them. This means that if there was a breach on the password manager database, your passwords are still secure.

I've been thinking about [this TurboTax crypto commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MD77Us4_r4) all day because it seems to fit the real life behavior of many people I know. Having been through a few cycles, I'd like to share some thoughts with you because I do believe that in the next year some people here will experience this roller coaster.\n\n1. Your mental health is more important and more fragile than you know. If you've spent years ignoring your own mental health but you've done well enough in crypto to begin dealing with more money than you've ever dealt with before, I suggest you begin seeing a licensed therapist. The stress of crypto volatility cannot be ignored. Some of the common issues people experience are moods that are tied to the exchange rate, loss of sleep, mania when the markets are high, depression when the markets are low, and general anxiety tied to the cryptocurrency world. You don't have to be labeled with a disorder to see a therapist, in fact, seeing a therapist proactively can reduce the likelihood of encountering a real mental health crisis.\n\n2. When (If) Ethereum starts doing really well in the next few months, you're likely to become wealthy on paper before you've actualized any of that wealth in your bank account. If selling some of your Ether will bring about a significant improvement in your life circumstance, you should do that. I hope our community is more sensible than the \"diamond hands\" memery where only the rich get richer. I highly suggest a written plan that you share with your significant other. I sign mine and tape it to the wall. Maybe it says, \"sell 5 Ether @ $5k.\" If you don't do this, you'll continue to ride the bull all the way up, and you'll watch as it deflates and you didn't take any profit. Even worse, without a plan, you may oversell, maybe you sell everything at $5k and the market keeps climbing to $10k and you're angry at yourself for doing that. People are *rarely* angry at themselves if the create a plan and stick to it.\n\n3. Don't change your lifestyle based on paper gains. The scenario works like this: Ether climbs to $5k, you believe it can never go lower, but you're not ready to sell yet. So you buy a new car, start eating out more, maybe go on vacations because you're wealthy on paper. Then an unexpected dip occurs, Ether crashes back to $2500 and you find yourself dealing with financial loss and depression. It's VERY important that you don't inflate your lifestyle unless you have the cash in your account to cover it. The really smart people will cash out a few years of living expenses in cash and lock it away to protect themselves from the next bear BEFORE considering inflating their lifestyle.\n\n4. You MUST pre-pay your taxes before you start spending anything you've cashed out. What happens, is you cash out $10k and start spending it, you'll plan to pay taxes later, then the price tanks and you have a $2500 tax bill, but you'll have to sell a LOT more coins to cover it. The stress will fester for months until you figure out a way to deal with it. If you're in the US you can use [this form](https://www.irs.gov/payments/direct-pay) to pre-pay federal income taxes, my goal is to do this the moment I get every bank withdrawal from selling. (I still mess up!)\n\n5. Finally. Don't sell everything. Work hard to choose a sell target that maximizes your current benefit without robbing you in the future. Sell what you need to, but hold what you can.\n\n(Edited to remove some redundant redundant phrasing)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Random thoughts.

I don&#39;t have enough USD to pay the bill, but I am struck by the irony of having to incur a 2022 tax liability in order to pay 2021&#39;s taxes.</p>\n\n<p>So of course I think about borrowing against eth instead of liquidating.  I have a liquity trove and LUSD I could use to cover a big chunk of the tax bill.  BUT, I can&#39;t withdraw LUSD to my bank account.  I&#39;d have to swap LUSD for USDC and then USDC -&gt; USD -&gt; tradfi.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any point in trying to use borrowed stables to avoid a taxable event / sale if any/all of the stables I could borrow would incur a taxable event in order withdraw to tradfi?  I think the IRS is double-logris&#39;ing me.  </p>\n\n<p>Edit: or has staring at koinly for the last 48 hours just fried my brain?  The borrowed stables don&#39;t have a cost basis exactly.  But even though the swap to USDC would be a taxable event, there shouldn&#39;t be any cap gains?    </p>\n\n<p>Does El Salvador let you pay income tax in crypto?  b/c that is sounding *really* appealing today.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-10 19:08:45","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-10 19:15:26","id":"i48qqzu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u0aidh","parent_id":"t3_u0aidh","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Maswasnos","body":"Why would the stables incur a taxable event to withdraw?
