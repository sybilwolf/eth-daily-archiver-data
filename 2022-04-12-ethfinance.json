To be fair to myself and everyone working on the merge, that's where we were then. The June 2022 prediction was made before the Kiln launch, and if kiln had launched flawlessly, we might be on target for June. The reality is that [Prysm experienced a fault](https://hackmd.io/@prysmaticlabs/HyZqgTA-c) during Kiln and it wasn't the perfect test that we might have hoped for. The good news (in my opinion) is that the problem with kiln put additional testing before the merge in the spotlight. Merge test tooling has been significantly expanded since Kiln (thanks to [Pari](https://twitter.com/parithosh_j) and likely many others) and [Marius](https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1513540976438091779) is sharing optimism regarding the success of the latest shadow fork of mainnet.

The developers are aware that they don't own the chain, they really do answer to the community. Organizers at all levels hold real discussions about the right direction for Ether and how to develop the chain that meets the most needs. That was really the origin of the June 2022 target - it was a way for the community to set high expectations. As I like to tell people, if we target June, we might hit July, if we target Q3 we might hit Q4. It's really okay to make estimates based on progress, we just have to be careful to keep it in scope. \n\nAnyone who is watching closely knows the merge is very much inbound.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>On March 11, I wrote a post titled <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/tbql1n/five_indicators_that_the_ethereum_merge_will/\">Five Indicators that the Ethereum Merge will occur in June, 2022</a>.
