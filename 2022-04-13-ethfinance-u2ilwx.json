It seemed like an exciting and hopeful project. I had never seriously considered web3 social media before that. Unfortunately, their discord reminded me of an ICO. There were a ton of hopeful statements and large UX and scalability issues without any defined process to address them. (No offense to the ideamarket people, I am staking the IMO they airdropped me and I hope they find success).\n\nA few weeks later, sassal started talking about [Lens Protocol](https://lens.dev/) on The Daily Gwei. The idea behind Lens is to create a censorship resistant back-end for social media platforms and allow the front-end to focus only on curating a view (subset) of the censorship resistant dataset.\n\nLens Protocol was founded by [Stani Kulechov](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov), who has been in the industry forever and also founded Aave. I was immediately sold, so I joined the [Lens Protocol discord](https://discord.gg/lensprotocol) and started looking around for projects that I could try out. The whole discussion at that time was still about dev tools. Not much to look at as an end user.\n\nAfter maybe a month, I checked again. Lens Protocol had hosted a hackathon that ended on March 30th called [LFGrow](https://lfgrow.ethglobal.com/) (amazing name btw). The winner of their \"best front-end\" award went to a project called [lenster.xyz](https://lenster.xyz/). I connected my wallet. Their site is literally in alpha and has only existed for two weeks, but with that in mind, it's a pretty great experience. Everything is being done through Mumbai testnet on Polygon for now, but lenster.xyz Twitter says they are ready for mainnet as soon as Lens Protocol officially launches.\n\nNext, I joined the [Lenster discord](https://discord.com/invite/B8eKhSSUwX), which had about 2k members at time of writing. If you join their discord, the #announcements channel has a link to a [verification site](https://www.kryptosign.io/sign/6qg56o3u) that asks you to prove that you are in the discord by both signing into discord and signing a message with your ETH wallet. Joining the discord and completing that verification will get you whitelisted for the Lenster beta and you will eventually receive a POAP for being an early user.\n\nIf you thought it couldn't get any better, here is their [roadmap](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/lfgrow/lenster-c6ffv) for this year:\n\n>2022 Q1 - Initial project setup and launch of closed alpha to users whose mainnet balance is at least $5 to prevent spam, the dApp usage will be minimal, you can create profiles and post any content on-chain.  \n>  \n>2022 Q2 - Release of Lenster beta to Discord server members, but still the app will use testnet, if Lens protocol is moved to mainnet we will be ready to switch to mainnet anytime during this phase.  \n>  \n>2022 Q3 - General availability of Lenster app, we will be hiring some devs to improve the dApp and make use of the prize as bounties to the devs.  \n>  \n>2022 Q4 - **Launch the Lenster DAO and Governance token** that can be used to manage our DAO with a lot of groups and subgroups built-in like Ecosystem, Public Goods, Meta governance, etc.\n\nI might have just become the web3 social media guy around here.

Because tx data doesnt have to written to L1, fees are about 15c a swap now, 4-5 times cheaper than Optimism. So this seems to be the validium equivalent for rollups? <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-anytrust-chains-cheaper-faster-l2-chains-with-minimal-trust-assumptions-31def59eb8d7\">Arbitrum Anytrust chains seems to be playing around with off-chain data as well, where a committee of nodes provides the data and not the L1</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Any L2 which doesn&#39;t write it&#39;s tx data to the Eth L1 isn&#39;t a true L2, but at the same time, it&#39;s fascinating the innovation happening on L2s compared to the rest of the altL1s. And I think not every plasma chanel/validium/whatever these things are need to have the same security guarantees as a canonical L2, and can be used for stuff like gaming.</p>\n\n<p>But importantly, with all these &quot;off chain&quot; data storage solutions popping up in production for ORUs, what exactly is the long term value prop of Celestia?
