Now they have a highly qualified company behind it driving the projects so it\u2019s certainly different than EVMs. But if the group behind them is coordinated, motivated, and can build something of value that people want to join, we will see a  price rise beyond what we ever thought possible</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-14 12:28:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i4qmyt1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u39laj","parent_id":"t1_i4qiez5","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-14 12:36:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i4qo4mf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u39laj","parent_id":"t1_i4qmyt1","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/matt0x_eth","body":"There are many similarities with Punks as well for sure.

Barrett was removed from the band for his drug use and mental problems, which interfered with his ability to perform and develop as a musician. He was replaced by David Gilmour, who was a friend of Barrett's.\n\nOne day during recording, Barrett decided to stop by Abbey Road Studios to see the band.

Then on one beautiful day, one of those souls woke up, got dressed, put on his very best .. a clean Unicorn t-shirt, and said ... \n\n*\u201dYou know what, I'm tired of looking at this mess... I'm going to try and fix this...I'm really not sure if it can be done, but I do know I'm sick of smelling the trash, especially that moldy old Cinnamon Bun\u201d*\n\nAnd he went to work that day, and again the next day, and the next, determined in his conviction, sure of his mission. Then something special happened! A thing even more fantastic than ***TWO*** baby dragons ... something more powerful and beautiful and magical and rare and valuable in every measurable way. Captain Unicorn, a one, Mr. Vitalik Buterin ... get this ... he gave his invention away! There was only one ask, *please use it to help him take out the trash.* In return you would have full permission to use it, to build whatever your heart desires, earn freely to support your family, without having to sell your soul for money! To live your life as you've chosen\u2026 *as long as you give away everything you build, just like he did for you that day.* So that others behind you can use what you made, and with a little bit of luck, and a lot of hard work, they can clean up the trash in their own local place!\n\nNow I could go on and on about this quite evolutionary invention simply named: **ETHEREUM**. I could talk off your ear about how its not just a cryptocurrency and why it's much deeper than people first imagine, and how money transfer is not it\u2019s real passion. I could write a whole score, maybe more, about what sort of revolutionary things I hope it will bring, and how I hope it changes the very way people think, and how I hope it can make, the systems of the world that provide all our wonderful things, rewarded just a little more amicably for you and me. Yessiree, I could ramble on for days about Proof of Stake, and Sharding and Merging and Merkle Tree shade...but honestly thats really nerdy and boring and you'd probably fall fast asleep. *I\u2019m a gentleman so no worries if you do, I\u2019ll tuck ya in and pull off your shoes*\n\n***CLAP CLAP WIDE AWAKE!***\n\n**SO!** I won't bore you with the intricacies of protocol layers and base fee structures. What I want to talk to you about, what I really came here to write about, is just a few little lines of code words, in a SQL database, just hiding out\u2026waiting for you to find out what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s connected to the world via wires, radios and satellites waaay out! All doing their part so you can reach it from the comfort of your house. You've probably never heard of it, but if you\u2019re ever fortunate enough to stumble on it, you should step into the daily thread to see what I'm talking about\u2026. And if you\u2019re brave enough, give us a shout out, and we\u2019ll all yell ***come on in and see what we\u2019re talking about!*** And guess what? They\u2019ll even hear *you* out! They\u2019ll even listen to what *you* want to talk about! They\u2019ll share what they know because these people are smart and they understand that *you reap what you sow.* These people still have a little soul.\n\nSo if by chance you wonder in, just know, thats the kind of place you just found. Sir's and madam's and whatever it is you feel you are to be, pull up a seat, because for someone like me, that little line in a corporations database \u2026 is an island of peace\u2026. so much more than just a place to discuss a crypto-cur-rency! While that is always our favorite topic of discussion, there is so much more love and connection always running about. I have been on this little island for \u2026. *one\u2026nine\u2026carry the 0..* \u2026 almost 22,000 hours now, and if you hadn\u2019t asked, I would have never considered where it started, what it\u2019s become, or even the time..that..has..pas\u2026it wasn\u2019t missed.\n\nSo thank you for that perspective, you just made me smile\u2026 you made me consider the beginning of this little distributed isle. You just helped me remember why I wanted to join the /r/ethfinance lion pride. Here I was able to find people that were sorta just like me, and they kinda even thought a little just like me, and despite my best efforts to make all their heads hurts, they never excluded me! Never a single scream or a shout, or a ***JohnB you\u2019re so stupid, everyone knows that, please just stop talking out loud!*** To me, just a guy with no Unicorn shirts, that was even more valuable than 2 *free* cherry pop tarts.\n\nBut check this out! It didn't stop there! Oh no ladies and gentlemen and everyone in between, they weren't even lined up to start, that wasn\u2019t The Eve. You see I not only found people minded like me, but they created a whole new part of me that wanted to learn and grown and I dare say ... try to become a BETTER me! *Whoah* These people who I have never met in real life, only through my keyboard and mouse, have made me laugh and cry and even rethink the age old question ... *\u201dWho am I and why?\u201d* and while these people surely don\u2019t have the all the answers, they do have some, and together they share and compare them, and use them to lift each other up and improve each others life times a hundred! \n\nThese people are way smarter than me, and they taught me valuable lessons like that *a rising tide lifts all boats* and that *we\u2019re stronger together* as long as we can all just agree, on one very simple and basic guiding ethical decree! Through that simple statement, a culture was born with hilarious memes, and phrases and sayings, jokes and hugs and nods and winks and \u2026 now even a \u2026 **NFT!?** *whoah!* \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb\n\n*Ok sir, this all sounds great, but what is all this gonna cost me?

If they audit you, definitely retain a tax attorney and be prepared to explain why you think you did your best.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-14 15:54:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i4rgs4w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u39laj","parent_id":"t1_i4reril","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/bman0920","body":"I don\u2019t see the point in hiring a tax attorney when they probably don\u2019t even know what they are doing in regards to crypto.
