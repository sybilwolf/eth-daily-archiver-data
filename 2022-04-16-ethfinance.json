Further: they should have given the chance to complain about losing access and regain access again. I agree, that it's important not to spread hate against people because they're from Russia.

I can't imagine that it's meant to be mean against Russian developers and should not be taken personally. Normally companies use frameworks like ISO 2700x, NIST, IT-Grundschutz, TISAX/VDA ISA etc. to protect their assets. Part of ISO 2700x is ISO 27002 which contains a chapter called \"human ressources security\". Part of this *could* be background checks for example. ISO 27005 is about risk management. Russia is on \"black lists\" in some job positions since years, if not decades. As well as other countries are on these lists. The recent aggression against Ukraine, as well as already completed cyber attacks, done by Russia or under *influence of Russia* make Russia and it's citizens a good candidate for \"being potentially more risky\". Means: theoretically the risk comming from a Russian developer could be viewed as higher now (compared to e.g. 3 months ago). An increased risk means, that you need to take actions to mitigate the risk, so for example you could change access permissions to lower permissions. It is not an action against the developer, it is a neutral action, just as neutral as watering the lawn (to protect the lawn from drying out). To make it even more transparent, you could look at VDA ISA catalouge 5.0.4, Chapter 2, Human Ressources: \"To what extent is the suitability of employees for sensitive work fields ensured?\"It doesn't matter if someone is a open source software developer or not. Not even every OSS dev is a nice person. You simply can't tell what it is happening inside the head of a person. From the outside he/she/it might appear \"nice\", but from the inside the person is far beyond evil. The other way around it possible, too. And even the most friendly person on earth could be put under pressure. Being put under pressure is much more likely if one is living in a country where e.g. totalitarian governments reign. And it is a possibility that these governments which not only start cyber attacks and attack other countries, spread desinformation, etc. are maybe using multiple ways to badly influence software, too. And software in general plays a huge role in our everyday lives, as everyone here knows...

Now I find myself, in some bizarre twist of events, actually kind of cherishing this fucking JPEG. It's so strange. For what it's worth, this is coming from someone who has been active in the BTC and ETH community since about 2014/2016. \"What fool would give their ETH, or any money, to buy a goddamn JPEG!?!?\" I'd say. Never thought I'd find myself become the very thing I always made fun of. \n\nSo that's where I'm coming from here before you continue reading. I've done a bit more thinking about EVMavericks and from a purely trading standpoint, actually think these could be worth more than what people are currently offering for them. Hell, I see offers for my EVM now at like 0.5 ETH on LooksRare but I still don't have any inclination to sell. Not only because 0.5 feels cheap, but because there is, again, some place of sentimental feeling in me. I actually don't want to give this thing up!? Anyways, consider the following:\n\n1. Anyone who has lurked or participated in /r/ethfinance for some time knows that it is actually a very tight-knit subreddit compared to other places, and certainly it is the closest knit crypto community. The community at /r/ethfinance is at the cutting edge of advances in Ethereum, constantly curating meaningful and interesting updates/developments/research going on in the space. Since Ethereum is by far the main DeFi chain (it's larger and has more TVL/developers than all the others combined), that really puts /r/ethfinance at the forefront for getting updates on crypto finance in general. IMO, this all makes being a member of /r/ethfinance a novel thing, and even more so if you're in that list of top 1,200 contributors eligible for the first 1,000 EVM mint. These 1,200 users are from the past year and were ranked based on comment number, karma, and participation in dailies.\n2. /r/ethfinance has over 80,000 members. Only 1,324 EVMavericks are available to mint. We are very close to approaching that final number, and I don't see them minting new ones any time soon, if at all. Once the DAO structure is set up I can't see the community allowing new mints. That would just reduce the uniqueness and novelty of them. Reading the comments on the sub, almost all regard these EVMs as something special/sentimental. I don't see the community reducing their novelty.\n3. Compare the supply of EVMs to the supply of 10,000 Bored Ape Yacht Club and 10,0000 Crypto Punks, which are nearly 10x higher.\n4. There are some very knowledgeable people on /r/ethfinance and no doubt some of the big names in crypto and crypto twitter all frequent there. I could possibly see EVMavericks picking up some crypto twitter mentions or even media mentions from big names. More exposure means generally means higher prices/volume.\n5. We are currently in a sideways/bear market (most likely). The NFT bubble has already popped. Given the buzz surrounding EVMavericks in the current dismal state of the NFT market, that tells me that there is some actual value there somewhere (likely coming from the points listed here). The fact that it has grown in floor price so quickly during this time period is actually pretty amazing. Who knows what a bull market in crypto (which would likely bring a bull in NFTs) could bring.\n6. Given the technical expertise of the members in /r/ethfinance, I could easily see some novel use cases sprout up in the future for these things. Who knows what that may look like.

I would follow minisculepenis&#39; suggestion of putting your key in a .env file, and then using it like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data = await uniswapPrice.getMidPrice(&quot;0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2&quot;, 18, \n&quot;0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F&quot;, 18, 1, process.env.INFURA_KEY)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Assuming the variable in the .env file is named <code>INFURA_KEY</code>, this would use your personal Infura key instead of the package&#39;s default. Depending on your framework you might need to install the dotenv package. That is probably the closest you&#39;ll get to not referencing it everywhere in your code unless you want to write wrapper functions, as that library does not have the friendliest interface.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>(if i get no bites here, I&#39;ll head over to ethdev, but i&#39;m a reddit version of agoraphobic and &#39;inside&#39;=ethfinance/ethstaker)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is probably quite a bit of overlap between those and ethdev, you&#39;ll see some familiar faces.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-16 11:34:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i4zk4f1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u4qfal","parent_id":"t1_i4yxjde","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nixorokish","body":"thank you!!! this is exactly what I needed!! sometimes i just need things like this spelled out for me when it's the first time i've done them.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>thank you!!! this is exactly what I needed!! sometimes i just need things like this spelled out for me when it&#39;s the first time i&#39;ve done them.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-16 11:41:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i4zl05a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u4qfal","parent_id":"t1_i4zk4f1","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/itchykittehs","body":"you could write a wrapper function to include the key.
