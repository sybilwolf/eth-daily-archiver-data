Speculative bubbles are incredible for some, terrible for others but undoubtedly disruptive for a community oriented project like EVMs. Whatever happens, we all need to be prepared to make and/or lose ungodly sums of money playing the NFT game if this hype train keeps going the way it has been. Just don&#39;t let this turbulence shake anyone out of this community.</p>\n\n<p>HODL strong fam. Don&#39;t get carried away gambling on NFTs and don&#39;t let gains you could&#39;ve had if you did one thing differently get you down. The latter is a fact of life and living with that fact is one of the best lessons to learn from crypto if you can come to terms with it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-17 15:23:34","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-17 16:10:32","id":"i54xk42","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u5fu3h","parent_id":"t3_u5fu3h","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/tech_consultant","body":"> **everyone has a price**\n\nThis is why I bought an extra.

I posted about this issue during the last delay that happened in October/November 2021 and even warned people that (given past behavior) we'd be lucky for the merge to happen in 2022. This was 5 months ago.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qp7by8/daily_general_discussion_november_8_2021/hjvgjge/\n\nLike you said, almost everyone thought that June 2022 would be a worst case scenario and the merge would happen before that.\n\nPeople need to understand that not everyone has the same goal and incentives. They like to see core developers as caretakers of the eth ecosystem but first and foremost they want to keep their jobs and their reputation. This is why they're erring on the side of caution and they will delay ad infinitum.\n\nA 'messy' merge would be somewhat of a embarrassment for them especially after multiple delays. Lot of people especially in the media like to spell doom and gloom if the merge goes wrong and has to be rolled back. But we've seen major chains get halted for hours even days, with no longterm impact on the price. \n\nWe've seen ETC get multiple 51% attacks and not only survive but beat ETH gains in 2021. Do I need to mention Shiba Inu or Dogecoin that only derive their value because people like cute dogs?\n\nThe crypto market is not very sophisticated at this point to put it mildly. We're still at the stage where developers should move fast and potentially break things, because if you don't someone else will take that first mover advantage. \n\nOur correlation with the Nasdaq is very high, we're considered as a tech play not finance. Conservativism has no place in crypto right now, maybe in the future.\n\nI've said this before and I'll say it again, the merge will only happen once community sentiment changes and starts to become more critical of core developers. I propose 3 changes that may somewhat help the situation:\n\n1. Short difficulty bomb delays of 1 month or less might help to keep the pressure up. As we've seen during previous delays, most of the work is done closer to the deadline. \n\n2. Better alignment of incentives between the community and developers, potentially tying bonuses with delivering certain important upgrades like the merge.\n\n3. Switching the selling of the Ethereum Foundation to time-based instead of price-based. We've seen the Foundation twice 'time the top' last year by sell hundreds of millions worth of ETH. The first happened in May 2021 and the next one happened in November 2021 right after the decision for the large difficulty bomb delay to June 2022.\n\nThis large selling not only crashes the price (like it would for any whale) but it prompts other market participants to sell as well. It can be especially damaging for sentiment right after a delay, because it signals to market participants that core developers have no faith that the merge will be delivered in any reasonable timeframe.\n\nMy proposal is for the Ethereum Foundation to sell a small amount of ETH every day, so that instead of 2 massive batches of 100-150 million we only get 0.5-1 million daily selling. \n\nThis would achieve two goals. First deliver superior returns by lowering market slippage and second remove the confidence hit that comes with a large market sell right after a delay. If the Foundation is selling the same dollar amount of ETH every day, then market participants can't ascribe any special information to the moves.\n\nBut most important is a shift in mindset by core developers. Ethereum is still far from the ultimate goal. After the merge there's still a lot of work to be done on sharding, scaling, statelessness, you name it. We're not gonna achieve these goals in any reasonable timeframe by being hyper conservative.\n\nI would hope that at least one of my suggestions gets adopted in the near future. But I fear that we're not quite there yet as a community. Prove me wrong :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Keep fighting the good fight sir.

I propose 3 changes that may somewhat help the situation:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Short difficulty bomb delays of 1 month or less might help to keep the pressure up. As we&#39;ve seen during previous delays, most of the work is done closer to the deadline. </p></li>\n<li><p>Better alignment of incentives between the community and developers, potentially tying bonuses with delivering certain important upgrades like the merge.</p></li>\n<li><p>Switching the selling of the Ethereum Foundation to time-based instead of price-based. We&#39;ve seen the Foundation twice &#39;time the top&#39; last year by sell hundreds of millions worth of ETH. The first happened in May 2021 and the next one happened in November 2021 right after the decision for the large difficulty bomb delay to June 2022.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This large selling not only crashes the price (like it would for any whale) but it prompts other market participants to sell as well. It can be especially damaging for sentiment right after a delay, because it signals to market participants that core developers have no faith that the merge will be delivered in any reasonable timeframe.</p>\n\n<p>My proposal is for the Ethereum Foundation to sell a small amount of ETH every day, so that instead of 2 massive batches of 100-150 million we only get 0.5-1 million daily selling. </p>\n\n<p>This would achieve two goals. First deliver superior returns by lowering market slippage and second remove the confidence hit that comes with a large market sell right after a delay. If the Foundation is selling the same dollar amount of ETH every day, then market participants can&#39;t ascribe any special information to the moves.</p>\n\n<p>But most important is a shift in mindset by core developers. Ethereum is still far from the ultimate goal. After the merge there&#39;s still a lot of work to be done on sharding, scaling, statelessness, you name it. We&#39;re not gonna achieve these goals in any reasonable timeframe by being hyper conservative.</p>\n\n<p>I would hope that at least one of my suggestions gets adopted in the near future. But I fear that we&#39;re not quite there yet as a community. Prove me wrong :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-17 15:46:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i550lyh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u5fu3h","parent_id":"t1_i54aa6m","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"Bad take","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Bad take</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-17 12:51:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i54cfc2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u5fu3h","parent_id":"t1_i54aa6m","score":-1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Plenix","body":"Does it make sense to move the EVM-discussions to it\u2019s own thread once the minting is completed?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Does it make sense to move the EVM-discussions to it\u2019s own thread once the minting is completed?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-17 03:01:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i52d01u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u5fu3h","parent_id":"t3_u5fu3h","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-17 03:14:10","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-08-21 05:54:51","id":"i52dvho","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u5fu3h","parent_id":"t1_i52d01u","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/decibels42","body":"This. \n\nAll of these \u201clet\u2019s make a separate thread\u201d posts reminds me of the YAM, farming, and DeFi summer related \u201clet\u2019s make a separate thread\u201d posts.
