I love speculating about hypothetical blockchain futures! The way I see it, Ethereum's roadmap is still many years from being completed, and every year there's more and more players, making updates way harder than they used to be. Eventually the big stuff will be done and we'll have the status quo of a strong, self-sustaining base layer with a battle tested, ossified protocol. Changing that status quo will be near impossible. Like today the community consensus is \"here's what we need to get done\" and sometimes stuff can change if there's a better way to achieve the same goals, so upgrades are not impossible, just a shit ton of hard work to coordinate everything and everyone. \n\nThe beauty of the modular design is that once the roadmap is complete, the politics craps you mention will most likely happen on layers above, where different independant teams do their own thing on their side and only interact with the base layer to settle stuff, buy secure blockspace, etc. These teams can have completely opposite goals and hate each other, but the schelling point will always be that the base layer doesn't change, unless *absolutely* necessary (for example making shit quantum resistant if there's a credible threat looming, or if some extreme vulnerability got discovered). Today we all expect a series of hard forks to bring needed features, but once those features are there, will there even be hard forks anymore? What will they be about?

To add each metric, we have to have a data source, a way to measure it, and informational material to accompany it. So this bakes down to a fairly simple list of 4 calls to action:\n\n1. What metrics would you like to see tracked to monitor the health of Ethereum's decentralization?\n2. Where can we get this data? This will likely prove to be the most challenging. Many metrics won't have an API available and we will likely need to create our own data (know how to do this? we need you!).\n3. What in particular does this metric track? What would be healthy and danger values for this metric? Is this subjective (many are) or is there a way to quantify what a health and dangerous value is (like with client diversity)?\n   1. As an example lets look at the validator geolocation diversity. For this we track the percent of validators *not* in the top 2 validator-populated countries (i.e. USA and Germany).\n   2. For the rating, 66% of the network not in the top 2 countries is deemed healthy and 33% is deemed unhealthy (i.e. USA/Germany account for 66% of validators). In this case the rating is both subjective and objective.\n   3. The objective part of the rating is 66%/33%. If something were to happen in the top countries where the validators were to be separated from the network (power cut out, war/attacks, etc) then it can fork the network and slash those validators (pretty much the same consequence as having a bug in a majority client).\n   4. The subjective part of the rating is tracking the top 2 countries instead of the only the top 1.\n4. And lastly, the content. Ideally there'd be a resource we could link to like [https://clientdiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org) for each metric that has info + dashboard + resources all in one place. Unfortunately that isn't the case so we plan to create dedicated pages for each metric and will need to create this content ourselves. We'd ideally like to have the following information:\n   1. Chart/dashboard for that single metric\n   2. What is this metric?\n   3. Why is it important?\n   4. What can people do to take action and improve the metric?\n   5. A list of tools, research, and further reading\n\nSome thoughts for additional metrics to track decentralization health (both protocol and ecosystem):\n\n* ETH ownership\n* Developer counts\n* Node API diversity (Infura, Alchemix, etc)\n* Average core developer pay (?)\n* Oracle diversity\n* Stablecoin diversity\n* L2 diversity\n* Node API diversity (Infura, Alchemix, etc)\n* Decentralized vs centralized liquidity\n* Derivatives diversity\n* Smart wallet diversity\n* Community health (not sure what this would entail)\n\nAs you can probably tell, this is a huge project and will be a lot of work.

You would then have 400 - 50 - 1950 = $1600 capital loss</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-18 11:47:57","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-18 11:52:44","id":"i58q1dm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u6565a","parent_id":"t1_i58pgg8","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ContributionRoutine","body":"Already paid up for this year, may be filing an amended return next year.

Why should I switch to something other than Geth? How would I switch off of Geth? I followed Somer&#39;s guide. </p>\n\n<p>I am having a lot of issues with my Teku validator (actually they are all connected to Node Exporter). I&#39;m trying to figure out when to prune etc but becuase Node Exporter isn&#39;t working, I have no clue how. I&#39;m thinking of doing a fresh install of Ubuntu and then forgetting Teku and trying Nimbus or a different testnet. I think I have the general idea of Grafana and stuff down, just this node exporter is frustrating me. Am I stupid to do this? </p>\n\n<p>Sub-question from last question: When do I know it is time for me to go to mainnet? Will I need to fresh install Ubuntu to move to mainnet?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I genuinely appreciate everybody here. Thank you!!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-18 05:28:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i578f7f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u6565a","parent_id":"t3_u6565a","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KuDeTa","body":"1.
