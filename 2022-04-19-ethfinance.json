The dual use of RPL as both a governance token for the protocol plus its value as additional collateral to protect rETH investors is sweetened by the provision of RPL rewards when it is staked.\n\nWhat is not yet public knowledge although freely discussed on the Rocketpool Discord, is development of the protocol to support SAAS operators who can then implement RP solutions for retail investors looking for a crypto component in their portfolio. This enhancement to RP's functionality necessarily relies on the platform operating on mainnet for long enough to demonstrate reliability and build up a TVL of a billion dollars or so.\n\nWith that stage well on the way to completion the stage is set for RPL to shine. Increasing interest in crypto from mainstream investors is combining with concern about true decentralisation and concerns about security. By focussing on permissionless and decentralised nodes and a higher level of security provided by the RPL collateral, Rocketpool is positioned to attract institutional support which will be the next wave of POS investors.\n\nCurrent RP node operators are in the box seat to benefit from that interest as they are technically proficient with its operation. Through its 3 betas and now live operations RP has effectively trained 1000 node operators to provide the base support level for its next growth phase. Those who are prepared to invest in RPL now are not only making their own ETH investment more secure but also providing the incentive for others to support Rocketpool and its view of how ETH should develop.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think it was recognised at the start that node operators would be hard to come by because of the requirement for them to have 16 ETH let alone the 32 ETH required for solo staking. The dual use of RPL as both a governance token for the protocol plus its value as additional collateral to protect rETH investors is sweetened by the provision of RPL rewards when it is staked.</p>\n\n<p>What is not yet public knowledge although freely discussed on the Rocketpool Discord, is development of the protocol to support SAAS operators who can then implement RP solutions for retail investors looking for a crypto component in their portfolio. This enhancement to RP&#39;s functionality necessarily relies on the platform operating on mainnet for long enough to demonstrate reliability and build up a TVL of a billion dollars or so.</p>\n\n<p>With that stage well on the way to completion the stage is set for RPL to shine. Increasing interest in crypto from mainstream investors is combining with concern about true decentralisation and concerns about security. By focussing on permissionless and decentralised nodes and a higher level of security provided by the RPL collateral, Rocketpool is positioned to attract institutional support which will be the next wave of POS investors.</p>\n\n<p>Current RP node operators are in the box seat to benefit from that interest as they are technically proficient with its operation. Through its 3 betas and now live operations RP has effectively trained 1000 node operators to provide the base support level for its next growth phase. Those who are prepared to invest in RPL now are not only making their own ETH investment more secure but also providing the incentive for others to support Rocketpool and its view of how ETH should develop.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-19 16:56:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i5exu13","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u6x409","parent_id":"t1_i5etwa4","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Some great research, thank you.\n\nIts rough out here being a RP node operator with low collateral...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some great research, thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Its rough out here being a RP node operator with low collateral...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-19 13:29:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i5e39hg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u6x409","parent_id":"t1_i5dw5gt","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-19 16:10:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i5erf92","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u6x409","parent_id":"t1_i5e39hg","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Im holding out for 32 ETH!

No. If a month ago there had been a post saying \u201c<a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">/r/ethfinance</a> is looking for someone to make an NFT, they will be compensated in ETH,\u201d someone happily would\u2019ve done it for a single digit amount of Ethereum. So there\u2019s definitely an argument for greed to be made.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone is feeling jealous of etheraider because he figured out a way to extract value from the community, I understand it, but I don\u2019t agree. Nobody should\u2019ve been looking for a way to capitalize on and leverage a community they didn\u2019t create in the first place, but it was bound to happen eventually. What this all comes down to is if the community is able to stand together to make itself better, or dissolve into infighting over a community token again</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-19 21:07:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i5fv1uy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u6x409","parent_id":"t1_i5ftjsp","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I'm not discounting the way /u/decibels42 feels.

But it's also my understanding that zkProofs scale waaaaay more than anything else, and could actually provide all the scaling we need for the entire planet without any other L1s required.

So with all of this ~~free money coming our way from ETH~~ ^(edit: I was being hyperbolic when I said that to get a point across, I definitely didn't mean to downplay the ups and downs of everyone's personal crypto journey. That's just how I feel about it sometimes when I compare myself to some people around me. I mean, fuck, who else receives multiple 4 or 5 figure airdrops each year? All for using an app? I'm sorry but I don't care how much you're putting at risk or time you're dedicating to keeping up to date with the latest crypto projects but that's basically free money to me.), I think it is important to give back to the world. For many of us, myself included, we are free-riders. Sure, we promote and educate others about this wonderful new technology which has so much to offer humanity, but for the most part, unless you\u2019re working full-time in this space you\u2019re gaining a disproportionate amount of money relative to the value you\u2019re creating. Sometimes this makes me feel guilty when I purchase that fancy meal I couldn\u2019t have afforded otherwise and there\u2019s someone on the other end of my transaction working their ass off just to make ends ~~meet~~ meat (ok, I ain\u2019t lion when I say that\u2019s enough puns for one post). Anyway, I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m getting at by now. I want to encourage our wonderful community to give back. So I want to create a regular ETHFinance charitable raise, probably every quarter (a bit like Gitcoin Grants matching rounds).\n\nNow this is where EVMs come in. Seeing u/Etheraider distribute EVMs so fairly and having spoken to him in DMs about how he went from little to no building experience to launching his own community NFT is fucking inspiring. Furthermore, his project has filled in the gaps of my brainstormed project. We could use Ethfinance community NFTs to vote to what charity we donate to each quarter and the fees taken from the trading of these NFTs further funds the charity donation pool. While I don\u2019t want to take the wind out of the sails of EVMs (this will take weeks if not months to build anyway), I think this could warrant its own NFT distribution to EthFinanciers (airdrop to EVM holders and minters anyone? \ud83e\udd14) as it has a distinct goal from the EVM project and it would help to have its own income/funding from NFT royalties. Furthermore, I have already come up with some possible incentive schemes to encourage people to donate and vote and maybe even hold EVMs (maybe EVM holders get a slightly more influential vote?).\n\nFinally, I have already got some ideas for names and NFT designs. I just don\u2019t want to reveal too much while it\u2019s early days as I have not doubt that it could see many iterations. Anyway, I look forward to your feedback on this as well as anyone who has experience to give me suggestion on dealing with the on-chain technical aspect of this. Etheraider has already given me some notes as I have been asking about his process with EVMs but anyone else with relevant experience please feel free to reach out with any advice.\n\nOh, and please don\u2019t be scared to criticise the idea or tell me you think this is the stupidest thing you ever heard of. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the stupidest thing you\u2019ve ever heard of but constructive criticism is important and you might just save me from dedicating a few months to a project that\u2019s doomed to fail.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the feedback so far. This idea is super early days and if anything does come from this, it'll probably look very different to anything I'm currently envisaging. This post is more to guage the viability of this concept. It may turn out that this is a non-starter and my enthusiasm is better focused on EVM itself and the different things within the scope of the ManeNetDAO and its intentions.

That&#39;s just how I feel about it sometimes when I compare myself to some people around me. I mean, fuck, who else received multiple 4 or 5 figure airdrops each year? All for using an app? I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t care how much you&#39;re putting at risk or time you&#39;re dedicating to keeping up to date with the latest crypto projects but that&#39;s basically free money to me.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-19 01:21:30","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-19 01:48:00","id":"i5bgj2n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u6x409","parent_id":"t1_i5be0q7","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Remolten11","body":"I think we should start an endowment.

Mining pools have similar distributions to our current beacon chain and both POW and POS have different ways that this can be dealt with.\nFor POW people can swap their hashrate to another pool if a 51% attack or censoring is going on but aside from that you can't really do anything. Then the question goes how much hashrate is really concentrated vs just be delagated to the same spot. I'd imagine for btc the true centralization of hashrate is much higher because gpu mining can be done much more casually and with lower risk.\n\nFor POS you attacking directly just gets you slashed which will be particularly brutal for an entity the size of lido. They will get one shot and accomplish virtually nothing other than destroying all of their business and money. \n\nFor censorship concerns I feel like no one addresses the elephant in the room and I have no clue why. It should be openly talked about repeatedly and known to the whole space as a deterrent. The elephant is social slashing if an entity begins to censor people on chain we can craft an eip to slash them without them performing an ordinary slashing offense. \n\nMaybe people feel that talking about this is overly antagonistic to large entities but i don't think so at all.
