Crypto exchange hacks were relatively frequent at that time, so moving funds to cold storage was widely seen as mission critical.\n\nThere were only two hardware wallet manufacturers to choose from: Trezor / Ledger. Trezor was more well-established, but they seemed to focus mostly on BTC. That was not ideal for me because I was only interested in Ethereum. I decided it was worth buying the first iteration of Ledger instead.\n\nA couple years passed and I was generally happy with my purchase. Ledger was a \"cool new company\" and their messaging aligned with the web3 core values (data privacy, censorship resistance, etc.).\n\nIn June 2020, I started getting a much higher volume of phishing emails. It was extra creepy, though. The emails included more of my personal info than expected. Here's an example:\n\n>MetaMask: We're now requiring all users who purchased a Ledger hardware wallet (\\[my first and last name\\]) to link or unlink their Ledger device with MetaMask. This is important to avoid lost or stolen funds. All wallets are currently linked by default. Learn more - \\[malicious link\\]\n\nI asked about it in the daily, then wandered over to the Ledger subreddit where I was able to get in contact with their CMO. They told me they were unaware of any security incidents and assured me the phishing was unrelated to Ledger.\n\nOne email even threatened physical harm if I didn't send funds to some random address. They used my full name and a reference to my home city. It said something to the effect of: \"we know you have crypto. we know where you live.\"\n\nLedger announced they had experienced a data breach and \"up to 8,000\" customer emails had been compromised. This still didn't add up. There were multiple people on r/ethfinance experiencing the same harassment as me.\n\nIn July 2020, I started receiving scam text messages on my phone. Same thing. They had my full name, my location, email, and my phone number. I followed Ledger's CMO around on reddit and twitter for a few weeks to demand that they tell us the truth.\n\nIn August 2020, Ledger's entire marketing database got posted on the internet in plain text. It included details from every customer that had bought a Ledger since the company's inception. I found my full name, primary email, cell number, and home address in the document.\n\nAfter that, Ledger finally sends out a \"we're sorry\" email. This was only after being caught red-handed and gaslighting their customers for months. They claimed they had no technical method to determine how many customers were impacted. The 8,000 estimate from June was complete bullshit.\n\nEven in that email, Ledger continued gaslighting. They conveniently omitted that phone numbers and shipping addresses had been compromised. I harassed them on twitter until they sent out an edit the following day.\n\nIn 2022, I am still dealing with the fallout. I've received 5-6 phishing attempts through SMS/WhatsApp this week alone.

Some thoughts...\n\n(disclaimer: I am a mod here, but not very active and this is not an official position)\n\nFirst lets strip away some of the naivety. Most of us have been in the crypto space for a long time. We've seen over and over again (and over and over) how dramatically monetary incentives affect behavior in communities. That is fundamentally what this space is about and we are all involved it at some level. We've seen it work spectacularly well in a few cases. We've also seen it go hilariously off the rails in so many more ways that we've lost count of the catastrophes.\n\nThis particular subreddit is pretty special in the space. We are all obviously involved with monetary incentives one way or the other so we have our bags and biases, but we do our best to take a measured approach. We make a huge effort to take clear eyed looks at new projects/technologies while being inclusive and also not becoming a shilling/marketing dumping ground. This is a very difficult line to walk. Much more difficult than most people know. I'm on the mod list, I see the crazy amount of shit that gets thrown at this sub day in and day out. This community is not an accident, it is the result of a huge amount of work, and it is not easily replicated. We should value and protect it.\n\nI honestly believe there was no mal intentions by any party involved with the EVM stuff, but we clearly ended up crossing some lines and heading down a slippery slope. Monetization of this community will seriously change it in ways that we probably do not want even if it gives us some short term financial gains. Obviously there were some misunderstandings, which involved (IMO) reasonable assumptions from both sides but the results are friction and ultimately incompatibility. No one thought it would get as big as it has, but hey, that's crypto for you and things change at scale. In true crypto fashion, we scaled to the breaking point in a week.\n\n(crypto pro tip: always imagine anything scaling up to an unreasonable level and think about if it will blow up or get better)\n\nI am really excited about the EVM project, I think it has a lot to offer and can energize its members (which is mostly us at the present) in interesting and valuable ways. But I agree with the moderation decisions here that it shouldn't be directly tied to this sub. It is its own thing which needs to have its own purpose and its own community. At first I was worried that this would split the community and cause a big rift, but I think this concern is overblown. The EVM community will be a different project with very different goals, it will overlap its membership to a large degree. There is nothing wrong with that and it has happened many times before even if this feels a little bit more personal.\n\nWe can't / shouldn't have EVM DAO votes dictating subreddit mod policies, etc. At the same time, sub moderators shouldn't be dictating EVM royalty/spending policies. These things should be separate. Separation of church and state makes both things better.\n\nThis feels a bit disappointing because it almost certainly makes the EVMs less valuable in the short term. But it is the right way to go about it, and there is no reason why the project can't go on to become immensely valuable in the future under its own merits.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been a long time member here and have had some time to reflect on the EVM stuff.

This community is not an accident, it is the result of a huge amount of work, and it is not easily replicated. We should value and protect it.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly believe there was no mal intentions by any party involved with the EVM stuff, but we clearly ended up crossing some lines and heading down a slippery slope. Monetization of this community will seriously change it in ways that we probably do not want even if it gives us some short term financial gains. Obviously there were some misunderstandings, which involved (IMO) reasonable assumptions from both sides but the results are friction and ultimately incompatibility. No one thought it would get as big as it has, but hey, that&#39;s crypto for you and things change at scale. In true crypto fashion, we scaled to the breaking point in a week.</p>\n\n<p>(crypto pro tip: always imagine anything scaling up to an unreasonable level and think about if it will blow up or get better)</p>\n\n<p>I am really excited about the EVM project, I think it has a lot to offer and can energize its members (which is mostly us at the present) in interesting and valuable ways. But I agree with the moderation decisions here that it shouldn&#39;t be directly tied to this sub. It is its own thing which needs to have its own purpose and its own community. At first I was worried that this would split the community and cause a big rift, but I think this concern is overblown. The EVM community will be a different project with very different goals, it will overlap its membership to a large degree. There is nothing wrong with that and it has happened many times before even if this feels a little bit more personal.</p>\n\n<p>We can&#39;t / shouldn&#39;t have EVM DAO votes dictating subreddit mod policies, etc. At the same time, sub moderators shouldn&#39;t be dictating EVM royalty/spending policies. These things should be separate. Separation of church and state makes both things better.</p>\n\n<p>This feels a bit disappointing because it almost certainly makes the EVMs less valuable in the short term. But it is the right way to go about it, and there is no reason why the project can&#39;t go on to become immensely valuable in the future under its own merits.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-20 16:04:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i5jngi2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u7orj1","parent_id":"t3_u7orj1","score":71,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BTFDandwin","body":">We can't / shouldn't have EVM DAO votes dictating subreddit mod policies, etc. At the same time, sub moderators shouldn't be dictating EVM royalty/spending policies.

There are answers coming our way, veiled answers but answers nonetheless. We finally saw tech and the 500 break ways a bit. We finally saw what a (smaller) mega cap does to an index without a broad market sympathy dump. There's a lot. I'll get the easy stuff out of the way.\n\nBTC? Still struggling with $41.5k. The daily highs inside this current bear flag are only $41,512 and $41,570. It's not far away, bulls, so wtf are you doing? With daily momentum nearing a peak and the weekly very much heading down, I'd even be wary of a slight break above $41.5k now because it's taken so much time, so much energy just to do that. I think another retest battle at $40.5k is increasingly possible.\n\nETH? Not much to say other than the ratio lost the 20 Day MA today, putting a retest of 0.0725 in our sights.\n\nSPY? Leashed but not ruined by the Nasdaq's day, SPY did manage to close the April 11 gap *barely* and only *intraday*. It's a bit of a topping pattern candle but there's still strength. Bulls still have the ball. They confirm it with another close tomorrow above 446-447. Close below 441 and the bears get a chance.\n\nOkay let's talk tech because... it's beautiful. I mean a beautiful chart. [Look at this.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xsK9Xnhw/) This is the gap trader's dream. Three days after the March 16 gap... CONFIRM. March 29 downgap... FILLED in two days. April 6th downgap... one day... two days... NOPE, FAILURE. This is how I look at charts. 345-350 is now a *tough* gap to fill up. Now only is it three days out from forming -- and recall that the vast majority of gaps fill within three trading days -- but we have 1-2-3-4-5 rejections. Can Tesla's big night drag it up through and clear the gap? Of course. We speak in probabilities here. It will be *tough* but it can happen. And if it *does* happen, it's noteworthy, to the tune of a risk-on market returning and overall tech strength as they shrug off a Netflix.\n\nRight now, QQQ is back below that 342 line. We've talked 342 for months now. It's a big line that puts -- once more, with feeling! -- bears back in control. After hours market saw it head above 342 so we'll see if real money takes hold there as well.\n\nThe Dow? [Gaps up](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FUntFvp3/) in defiance of the broad tech-driven indices. The blue collar, industrial core of the market is healthy... says Wall Street. You all know what to do now. Count to three ;)\n\nSame deal with IWM small caps, king of the risk-on. [Start the three count](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4DN1C7mn/) and see if bulls can survive this lite topping pattern candle from today. Keep in mind it's at the 202 resistance formed by the April 5th gap down. Two weeks out from that means it's a strong level.\n\nWe've now got pretty damn good evidence to state that crypto follows tech specifically within the broad market. And tech isn't looking particularly healthy. We've got two titans FB and NFLX collapsing. Microsoft, Nvidia, Google performing healthy corrections but remaining a bit weak. Amazon correcting and looking very weak. Tesla corrected but being a ridiculously liquid meme stock recovered already and sits on top of support. Apple has not yet corrected and is weakening on top of near-term support at 165. These are your horsemen of the techpocalypse. Watch closely as earnings season kicks into high gear next week.\n\nSpeaking of earnings, it's started out mixed to negative. Lockheed Martin, Johnson & Johnson, and JP Morgan all with dreary to bad guidance through year end. Netflix -- no more needs to be said. Tesla is the shining star. We'll see if consumers can continue to drop $50k on a sedan at a rate that satisfies their metrics as inflation continues toward 9 and 10%.\n\nAT&T and Snap (wtf?) tomorrow along with American Airlines (who should actually have the positive guidance if United's is something to go by) and Philip Morris. Friday has Verizon and AMEX.\n\nWhew. That was a lot. I didn't organize this quite as well as I normally do so please please please comment and critique me. Ask questions. Theorize and hypothesize along with me. This ain't an echo chamber.\n\nCheers!\n\nedit: bonus upgap and (potential) topping pattern candle on [Financials](https://www.tradingview.com/x/wUqLBuUJ/). iffy with JP Morgan underperforming in earnings and Morgan Stanley remaining a permabear in the press. any other morgans wanna start a freakin' bank? /u/MorganZero?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What a day in the markets.

Some sort of public goods funding, incorporation of Gitcoin grants, RPL, etc, is more than enough to give value to our EVMs. It&#39;s also just way cooler, as we&#39;re incentivizing positive contributions to the ethereum ecosystem as whole, rather than individual self-interests through karma farming, or however the introduction of financial incentives to this community might manifest.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-20 01:30:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i5gh572","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u7orj1","parent_id":"t1_i5geq2w","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/proof-of-lake","body":"Agree 100%\n\nI was lucky enough to get at EVM, but there's no way an NFT with a max supply of 1,324 can fully reflect a reddit community of 80,000 people.\n\nIt needs to be viewed as something special that is \"connected\" to this sub, but in no way constituting the community or breaking this group here into any sorts of tiers.

So if you deposit 10 rETH, you can take out a little over 5 alETH which should be redeemable for an equivalent amount of ETH. That loan is then paid off over time through the staking yield, so you technically never have to pay anything. Think of it as getting an advance on your staking yield. \n\nAlchemix does rely on several other DeFi apps to work, however, so there's a degree of compounding risk here. If Yearn went down or if the alETH peg failed, Alchemix would not be in great shape. \n\nRocket Pool on the other hand is a fairly self-contained system. With its deposit pool, there's a fairly reliable way to mint/redeem rETH all the time. As a node operator, you really only need to trust their smart contracts for depositing and then claiming RPL rewards. It's not risk-free, but I would say it is lower risk. The main drawback to me is that if you are a node operator, your ETH is locked up and you're supposed to keep it locked up for a long, long time to make the network healthier. In DeFi you can always just exit with no strings attached.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d describe Alchemix as lower-risk than Rocket Pool, but if you&#39;d like to read up on it the best way to do so is on their site:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://alchemix.fi/\">https://alchemix.fi/</a></p>\n\n<p>Basically what Alchemix does is it takes your rETH or wstETH and uses the staking yield on it to gradually pay off a loan you take out against that rETH or wstETH, up to 50% of the value. So if you deposit 10 rETH, you can take out a little over 5 alETH which should be redeemable for an equivalent amount of ETH. That loan is then paid off over time through the staking yield, so you technically never have to pay anything. Think of it as getting an advance on your staking yield. </p>\n\n<p>Alchemix does rely on several other DeFi apps to work, however, so there&#39;s a degree of compounding risk here. If Yearn went down or if the alETH peg failed, Alchemix would not be in great shape. </p>\n\n<p>Rocket Pool on the other hand is a fairly self-contained system. With its deposit pool, there&#39;s a fairly reliable way to mint/redeem rETH all the time.

An NFT collection like this has value because of the community they represent and the legitimacy that our users bring- the actual art and creation of the NFT is a minor contribution to its value in cases like these. We expended some of this subs credibility to generate that value (see the oil well analogy, you aren't generating much value by being the guy to pump oil out of the well you're extracting it).

Honestly we just wanted a peaceful end to this and to move on, we would have preferred no personal gain at all.

An NFT collection like this has value because of the community they represent and the legitimacy that our users bring- the actual art and creation of the NFT is a minor contribution to its value in cases like these. We expended some of this subs credibility to generate that value (see the oil well analogy, you aren&#39;t generating much value by being the guy to pump oil out of the well you&#39;re extracting it). If we had understood that expense would in any way enrich a single person, we would have rejected it up front.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Monetization of the subreddit for personal gain is firmly against the ethos of this subreddit. It&#39;s a big part of why it exists.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We acknowledge to etheraider that some compensation isn&#39;t unreasonable at this point but can&#39;t come to an agreement on what that looks like. Honestly we just wanted a peaceful end to this and to move on, we would have preferred no personal gain at all.

If not, we must consider the implications for the sub if we allow this style of giving to continue unabated in the future - as NFTs and other onchain content goes mainstream.\n\nGoing forward, I\u2019d like us to consider a general policy that:\n\n* Prevents any individual member from profiting via projects they create, if the project derives value from associating with the sub or members\u2019 contributions to it. \n\n* This should not preclude people from generously contributing time through whatever medium they prefer to create on or off chain projects geared towoards charity or community organisations - as they often have - they just shouldn\u2019t expect to make any personal gain from it. \n\n* It should also not prevent someone from creating community NFTs, etc that end up commanding significant value, they just shouldn\u2019t expect to be able personally profit using revenue, fees or royalty mechanisms. \n\n* Finally, any future projects should be done with the full consent of the mods and community in advance.\n\nOn EVMs specifically I think we have a few options:\n\nIf we want to keep these NFTs as a kind of mascot within the domain of this community, we should have asked /u/etheraider to entirely forego all creator rewards, but I think that ship has already sailed. \n\nIf on the other hand, etheraider would prefer to keep the ongoing royalties, then we could consider limiting conversation around them beyond high level updates and adopt the policy described above to actively dissuade others from similar attempts. \n\nFinally, I want to actively re-emphasise that in many ways etheraiders contribution is novel and quite brilliant. This situation is not so much his doing, but damned near inevitable in the landscape we inhabit. \n\nAll in all, I think we\u2019ve collectively walked into a difficult moment from a place of very good intention, but we need to do some thinking for the future.

This situation is not so much his doing, but damned near inevitable in the landscape we inhabit. </p>\n\n<p>All in all, I think we\u2019ve collectively walked into a difficult moment from a place of very good intention, but we need to do some thinking for the future. I\u2019m really keen to keep this treasured community as the free, generous and spontaneous corner it originally set out to be.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-20 08:04:54","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-20 10:55:37","id":"i5hmi8l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u7orj1","parent_id":"t3_u7orj1","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Remolten11","body":"Censorship of EVM discussion is a terrible idea; especially, basing it on the outcome of the royalty incentive structure.
