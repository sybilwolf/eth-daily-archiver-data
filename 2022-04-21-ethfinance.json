Reminds me of one of my favorite Marc Andreseen quotes:\n\n> The entire concept of money is--maybe after God--is like the single most emotionally loaded concept that we have in humanity. Money makes people mad under any circumstances on any topic related to money, and it\u2019s just because it's something that we all rely on. And there\u2019s always this sense of unfairness, so money gets people really cranked up.\n\n> There is the idea of cryptocurrency and blockchain and this new idea of distributed trust on the internet. Then there is this application of that technology... which is a new kind of money. I think most people are unable to dispassionately look at the mechanics of how it works without almost getting preemptively upset. Like just angry. How dare the nerds come up with some new form of money... there\u2019s got to be something wrong with this, and I will now attempt to find the thirty possible things that could be wrong with this until I find one that proves that this can\u2019t possibly work. Because obviously it violates the Laws of Nature and governments, and you know whatever whatever.\n> \n> ...and by the way I\u2019m not even just talking about like regular people, bank CEOs are just as furious if you bring up that point, and they just get really upset. And I\u2019m like, did you get upset about your toaster? Like it\u2019s just a technology. It\u2019s just a thing. And you can you can study it and you can learn about it and you can think about it, and you\u2019ll either conclude it\u2019s good or not, but it\u2019s not going to bite you. It\u2019s just a thing, right, and so I like the way I look at it.\n> \n> It goes back to like it\u2019s just a thing.

Even the smell of it is enough to bend minds</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Side note, this is also probably one of the biggest reasons why a lot of people still have such a visceral, pure hatred reaction to anything related to crypto. Reminds me of one of my favorite Marc Andreseen quotes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The entire concept of money is--maybe after God--is like the single most emotionally loaded concept that we have in humanity. Money makes people mad under any circumstances on any topic related to money, and it\u2019s just because it&#39;s something that we all rely on. And there\u2019s always this sense of unfairness, so money gets people really cranked up.</p>\n\n<p>There is the idea of cryptocurrency and blockchain and this new idea of distributed trust on the internet. Then there is this application of that technology... which is a new kind of money. I think most people are unable to dispassionately look at the mechanics of how it works without almost getting preemptively upset. Like just angry. How dare the nerds come up with some new form of money... there\u2019s got to be something wrong with this, and I will now attempt to find the thirty possible things that could be wrong with this until I find one that proves that this can\u2019t possibly work. Because obviously it violates the Laws of Nature and governments, and you know whatever whatever.</p>\n\n<p>...and by the way I\u2019m not even just talking about like regular people, bank CEOs are just as furious if you bring up that point, and they just get really upset. And I\u2019m like, did you get upset about your toaster? Like it\u2019s just a technology. It\u2019s just a thing. And you can you can study it and you can learn about it and you can think about it, and you\u2019ll either conclude it\u2019s good or not, but it\u2019s not going to bite you.
