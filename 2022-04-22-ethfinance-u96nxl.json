It's true that opiates were involved but he speaks nothing of his long addiction to gambling and the greed that eventually consumed him and so many lives.

And nuggets news claims no responsibility as it was only Alex's actions on the platform.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have the time currently to pull up everything that has been collected by those who have come forward but seeing as Alex has decided it's his time now to make a comeback, I will endeavor to fight the misinformation that he knowingly propagates. My time is often very limited due to work and family, so I know there will be a lot of questions and I will do my best to respond or make separate posts.\n\nI honestly wanted to put this behind me as it was a very terrible experience for my family and I but I hope that coming forward will give others caution for the next project that Alex has been so diligently working on.

It's a completely decentralized stable coin that's pegged to the US dollar, collateralized by ETH, and held to peg by staking rewards. A separate token will be used as a staking and partial governance token. What Alex is going to do is he's going to attempt to rebrand and rename this project and claim that he has solved this desperately needed answer to DeFi's number one problem. He may very well have found and intriguing solution to this but what is most upsetting is that he will have had no accountability for his crimes and will neither accept any admission to wrongdoing. Instead he will fabricate a hero's comeback and claim his stable coin as the savior of DeFi.\n\nI had hoped to spend days on a thorough write-up, so I do apologize if this seems unclear,disjointed, or riddled with grammatical errors but it was heavy on me to at least get a brief message out as a caution and warning to what seems an all too familiar scenario in crypto.\n\nLastly, my greatest hope is that someone here someone with connections who is bright and able would be able to beat Alex to the punch for a decentralized that relies fully upon ETH and no other asset. The whole ordeal was very exhausting and I'm not very interested in pursuing further legal action, but what I care about more than anything is that this decentralized stable coin is not in his hands.

The relative motion between the Pacific Plate and the hotspot has resulted in a chain of islands, atolls and seamounts extending 3,900 miles (6,200 kilometers) from the central Pacific nearly to Russia's Far East.\n\nThe youngest volcano, L\u014dihi, lies 3,200 feet (975 meters) beneath the sea surface on the flank of Mauna Loa on the island of Hawai'i, the youngest of the islands at 700,000 years or less.\n\nAncient Hawaiians were the first to notice the behavior of the hotspot. They saw differences in erosion, soil formation and vegetation among the islands and deduced that those to the northwest (Ni\u02bbihau and Kaua\u02bbi) were older than those to the southeast (Maui and Hawaii). The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes.\n\nAccording to the myth, Pele originally lived on Kauai, when her older sister N\u0101maka, the Goddess of the Sea, attacked her for seducing her husband. Pele fled southeast to the island of Oahu. When forced by N\u0101maka to flee again, Pele moved southeast to Maui and finally to Hawaii, where she still lives in Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu at the summit of K\u012blauea. There she was safe, because the slopes of the volcano are so high that even N\u0101maka's mighty waves could not reach her.

The relative motion between the Pacific Plate and the hotspot has resulted in a chain of islands, atolls and seamounts extending 3,900 miles (6,200 kilometers) from the central Pacific nearly to Russia&#39;s Far East.</p>\n\n<p>The youngest volcano, L\u014dihi, lies 3,200 feet (975 meters) beneath the sea surface on the flank of Mauna Loa on the island of Hawai&#39;i, the youngest of the islands at 700,000 years or less.</p>\n\n<p>Ancient Hawaiians were the first to notice the behavior of the hotspot. They saw differences in erosion, soil formation and vegetation among the islands and deduced that those to the northwest (Ni\u02bbihau and Kaua\u02bbi) were older than those to the southeast (Maui and Hawaii). The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes.</p>\n\n<p>According to the myth, Pele originally lived on Kauai, when her older sister N\u0101maka, the Goddess of the Sea, attacked her for seducing her husband. Pele fled southeast to the island of Oahu. When forced by N\u0101maka to flee again, Pele moved southeast to Maui and finally to Hawaii, where she still lives in Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu at the summit of K\u012blauea. There she was safe, because the slopes of the volcano are so high that even N\u0101maka&#39;s mighty waves could not reach her. Pele&#39;s mythical flight, which alludes to an eternal struggle between volcanic islands and ocean waves, is consistent with geologic evidence about the ages of the islands decreasing to the southeast.</p>\n\n<p>Hodlercon attendees who visit multiple islands will notice the dramatic difference in landscapes between, say, the heavily eroded Napali Coast on Kauai and the loping lava flows of the Big Island.</p>\n\n<p>Internet anthropologists have dated the earliest confirmed evidence of <a href=\"https://hodlercon.com/\">Hawaii 2022</a> to January 14, 2020.

I knew a little bit about a couple of the existing protocols for doing that and thought I'd brush up on that knowledge and write a summary. I am no expert on fractionalization and haven't actually used either, just read a lot and poked around. It's simply too much text for discord and it's probably a better fit here anyway. So here you go: a wall of text on Fractional and NFTX.\n\n**Fractionalized EVM Options**\r\n\r\n*Traditional DAO Treasury*\n\r\nI list this first not because it is a good option but because it serves as a comparison to the others. It's always possible to just fundraise, distribute ERC20 governance tokens, purchase an NFT for a multisig-controlled treasury, and have coin votes determine what happens to the NFT. If you can trust the multisig to carry out the will of the token holders and not branch out into other things, you can probably consider the tokens to be close to fractionalized ownership of the NFT. Juicebox or any other platform for ICOs would fill this role.\r\n\r\n*Fractional*\n\r\n[Fractional](https://fractional.art/) is probably the first name that comes to mind when it comes to fractionalized NFTs. The actions that would be delegated to the multisig are instead coded into a smart contract vault, further decentralizing and specializing for this purpose. Your ERC20 tokens represent a fractional claim on the deposited NFT. But there are a few specific things to be aware of.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine if fractionalized ownership were distributed over enough token holders, it would be very difficult to, at some point, collect all the tokens and reform the full NFT--this is called reconstitution. Just one person holding one token could keep the NFT locked up in the vault forever. And if there's no way to get the NFT back, are the tokens actually fractionalized ownership? Fractional's solution for this is a buyout system. Token holders can vote on a \"reserve price\" at which they'd be willing to sell out. If a quorum of voters establish a buyout price, then anyone can deposit that much ETH to start an auction for the NFT. After the auction, the NFT is reconstituted, given to the winner, and token holders can claim their share of the sale. So this does mean it's possible for the vault to be dissolved by an outside factor, which isn't much fun for the token holders, but it preserves the fractionalized nature of the tokens and at least is a nice payday. Vaults can also contain a basket of NFTs, but I believe it's not possible to do a partial buyout of a subset of them.\r\n\r\nThe main parameters for a vault pertain to its reserve price (a minimum and maximum factor over the base price of the NFT), the auction in case of buyout (auction length and a minimum bid increase), and fee amounts. If someone already owns an NFT and wants to sell off part of it, they would be considered its \"curator\". With a fee set, the token supply representing the fractionalized portion of ownership inflates by a fixed percentage annually, getting assigned to the curator. Fees may not be appropriate for a group of folks collectively owning an EVM, but you could imagine it being more suitable for a BAYC owner who wants to fractionalize 20% of it and get paid for providing that service. That said, browsing the collections I see most of them with a 0% creator fee, so the community may not be a big fan of the concept.\r\n\r\n*NFTX*\n\r\n[NFTX](https://nftx.io/) is another platform for NFT fractionalization. However, NFTX is focused on fractionalizing *groups* of NFTs, most often the *floor* NFTs of a given collection. When creating an NFTX vault, the creator specifies a list of acceptable NFTs for deposit, most commonly an entire collection (e.g. all BAYCs, all EVMs, etc) but sometimes subsets (e.g. a vault consisting of only holy EVMs). Anyone can deposit a suitable NFT into the vault, and they are then minted one ERC20 token (called a vToken, divisible to plenty of decimal places) representing a claim on the NFT. If multiple NFTs are in the vault, anyone can accumulate 1.0 of the corresponding vToken to claim an NFT of their choice from the vault.\r\n\r\nThere is no buyout mechanism as in Fractional, but with enough NFTs in a vault there should be enough vTokens floating around that you can track down the liquidity to claim (and therefore reconstitute) one. In fact, NFTX incentivizes liquidity in sushiswap pools (pairing the vToken with ETH). It's a fairly standard LP staking system. Deposit the NFT for the vToken, create a sushiswap LP in the vToken:ETH pair, then stake the LP through NFTX. Fees are charged on most vault actions like minting and redeeming, and those fees are sent to the liquidity providers (see [here](https://nftx.io/rewards/pools/) ). This setup incentivizes providing liquidity, making it easy to instantly swap ETH for 1 vToken and buy an NFT, or sell an NFT and cash out to ETH. No need to wait for the right offer on LooksRare to come around.\r\n\r\nThe interesting emergent property of this system is better floor price discovery for an NFT collection. Why specifically the floor? Well, imagine a vault containing a bunch of OG lions and one sweet matrix lion. I could buy the cheapest floor lion off of LooksRare, deposit it into the NFTX vault for 1 vToken, turn around and redeem that 1 vToken for the matrix lion, then sell the matrix lion on LooksRare for a nice profit. In fact, NFT swaps (deposit one NFT in exchange for 1 NFT from the vault) are a standard atomic function of vaults. So in the long run, any price differences between the NFTs will be arbitraged out until the remaining NFTs are all within gas+fees range of each others' value. This means easy entry from ETH -> floor NFT, easy exit from floor NFT -> ETH, and easy swaps between floor NFTS in case of personal accessory preferences.\r\n\r\n*Conclusion*\n\r\nFractional is good for fractionalizing particularly interesting NFTs (rare and expensive), and especially suited for current owners who want to sell off part of a rare NFT they already own (due to the curator fee system). A Fractional vault for a rare NFT may be valuable in creating a small focused community and giving smaller fish some access to rarer NFTs they could normally not afford.  NFTX is good for fractionalizing the broad floor of a collection. An NFTX vault for a NFT collection may be valuable to improve floor price discovery and floor entry/exit/swaps.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some folks have been talking in the EVMavs discord (wait, don&#39;t leave yet!) about playing around with NFT fractionalization.
