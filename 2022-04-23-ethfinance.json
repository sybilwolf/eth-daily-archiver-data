It sends it to the other nodes who ALL must verify all the transactions.\n\nZK systems [solve this scaling problem](https://i.imgur.com/u7EK2RG.png) because instead of all the nodes having to verify the entire set of transactions, the sequencer generates a short proof that it did execute these transactions correctly, and then sends it to all the other nodes that verify these proofs.\n\nBut there's still a problem: All of the data (all the transactions), has to be sent to all of the different nodes to ensure that the data is available. Even though these nodes have verified that the state transition has occurred correctly, they may not be able to reconstruct the state if the data is not sent to all of the nodes. In this case the sequencer or a proposer could completely halt the system and perform an extortion attack.\n\nThe solution is to make sure that these transactions are available in a large trust group - but that incurs [a cost and scalability penalty.](https://i.imgur.com/KpJl7LN.png) In a ZKR the sequencer collects all of the data generated by users interacting with applications, and stores this data into the data layer of the protocol. In Ethereum it's stored as calldata in the data layer, and the validity proofs are posted to the settlement layer. The validity proofs are not costly (at least at scale) because you can have a lot of transactions in the block and a short validity proof; but the amount of data being stored on Ethereum is actually quite large because that scales with the number of transactions in your system.\n\nTo compound this problem, for ZKR\u2019s they are competing in a landscape of many alternate layers 1\u2019s. These alternate layer 1\u2019s can offer near zero fees by paying their validators in their native tokens (which is basically just paying in future revenue). And while it\u2019s an attractive model for them, rollups cannot use this model because they have to pay for the non scalability in real hard ETH (or whatever the layer 1 demands). Of course these alternate layers 1's may not offer the same decentralization and security as Ethereum.\n\nSo the question becomes: Is it possible to get the best of both worlds and have ETH security with near-zero fees?\n\nOne solution that\u2019s been proposed to solve this problem is [a separate DA layer.](https://i.imgur.com/qB9SB2A.png) \n\nThe idea is instead of the sequencer storing all data on Ethereum, they store the data in a separate data availability layer that somebody builds. The benefit is low cost because this DA layer may be custom built for your particular rollup. The validity proof can still be written into Ethereum, and the DA layer reports to Ethereum that \u201chey I have checked that the data is available\u201d. This is known as validium, and the big gain is near-zero fees because it\u2019s built for this purpose. \n\nBut there are some problems:\n\n* First, the whole point of a rollup was to derive the full security of a layer one system like Ethereum. We do not get that with this\n* Second, there is a large capital cost of staking. E.g. If this DA layer had its own token that needed to be staked to provide this service (and therefore create some cryptoeconomic cost that could be slashed if the data is unavailable). If you want staking you have to pay capital cost\n* Third, there is a value alignment problem. Because the cost of validity proofs do not scale with the amount of data, while costs for storing data DO scale with the amount of data; there is only an incentive alignment with the holders of the DA system while the value alignment between the core L1 and L2 is broken\n\nThese problems are not specific to DA. They are specific to ANY middleware. Middleware is anything that has it's own trust network (think oracles, bridges, sidechains, keepers - or anything that needs its own distributed validation services).\n\nToday the current ecosystem is organised like this: Ethereum creates and supplies trust to dapps who consume that trust and pay fees in exchange. However, Ethereum is only able to provide trust in one particular axis: block making. Ethereum stakers only certify block making and do not certify anything else. So if you want an oracle input, or new DA, or a different execution environment you have to opt into some other middleware.\n\nThe [economics of this kind of middleware system](https://i.imgur.com/PL00IRq.png) has three key problems:\n\n* The middleware faces the cost of capital if it's staked\n* Dapps pay high fees to Ethereum for security, but the security they\u2019re getting is the worst of all the things that they depend on (lowest common denominator). This middleware will dominate their cost of corruption and their trust model\n* Ethereum is supposed to be the decentralized trust source yet there are so many isolated islands of trust rather than a federated union of trust\n\nThe thing about the middleware space though is that these are the algorithms that drive our ecosystem forwards. We need new oracles, we need new data availability protocols, we need new execution engines. We need people to be able to iterate permissionlessly and compete on all of these things. We need open innovation. But to do open innovation today you need to be able to create your own decentralized trust network.\n\nThis brings us to [EigenLayr.](https://i.imgur.com/W2Ip0dD.png)\n\nEigenLayr lets builders deploy their distributed systems on an existing large trust network.\n\nThe way this works is through a set of smart contracts on Ethereum that allow a subset of ETH stakers to \"restake\" their ETH with EigenLayr. By subjecting their stake to additional slashing conditions, ETH stakers can opt in to provide services on a wide variety of different middleware built on EigenLayr, and earn additional revenue in return. The middleware is not necessarily built by EigenLayr - anyone can build and deploy the middleware.\n\nThe key innovation of restaking is that if you do something bad on EigenLayr, you lose your ETH! You're not losing Eigen tokens. It's a very different value proposition to previous systems like Bitcoin merge-mining and results in different economic incentives. \n\nThis solves the three key problems discussed above:\n\n* Because EigenLayr allows re-use of staked capital to provide additional services, the marginal cost of capital to opt in to EigenLayr is zero\n* Dapps can potentially can get the full Ethereum trust if they consime EigenLayr services (this is measurable)\n* There is incentive alignment and you get internalized integrated trust back into a common protocol. Stakers can now earn revenue on ordering, execution, authentication, oracles, etc. \n\nA subset of these ETH restakers can then opt-in to offer data availability sampling services to [DataLayr,](https://i.imgur.com/i6W8Giz.png) with incentives and penalties (slashing). \n\nDataLayr uses [danksharding's state-of-the-art architecture,](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1517137614741983234) but with a different opt-in model without a P2P network. It has all the benefits of data availability sampling where the more nodes there are, the more throughput is available, and it's trivially cheap to verify. It uses a similar architecture to DS but doesn't need the Ethereum core protocol to implement Danksharding or even blob txs.\n\nWhile the potential for security is orders of magnitudes higher than a new DA layer, it's only potential. It's unclear how much it will materialize, and how many ETH stakers will be incentivized to offer data availability services. Additionally, Ethereum's native DA isn't just secured by the stake, but also holds up if the stake turns malicious. The ability of full Ethereum nodes to reject an unavailable chain cannot be provided by DataLayr. Native DA is THE most secure as the chain will fork for unavailable blocks. When you transport DA from one chain to the other, the bridge is the security limit. With datalayr there is no bridge as DataLayr does not have a chain. But still native DA on ETH is the gold standard security as even if majority ETH is malicious, the chain will fork to follow the available chain.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nEigenLayr lets ETH stakers \"restake\" their ETH (and even staking derivatives like stETH) and opt in to providing additional services in return for an additional return on their stake.\n\nDataLayr is a DA layer based on danksharding that attempts to leverage the security of ETH instead of a new token.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Just finished watching the EigenLayr/DataLayr presentation from the ZK summit: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SCIuwh9ya8U?t=19070\">Hyperscale and Capital Efficient Data Availability for ZK Systems.</a> Here are some of my notes:</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re all familiar with the <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/rLXYysz.png\">scaling problem of blockchains</a>: They usually have a leader-based system where a single node, the proposer, proposes a block and executes all transactions.

It&#39;s a very different value proposition to previous systems like Bitcoin merge-mining and results in different economic incentives. </p>\n\n<p>This solves the three key problems discussed above:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Because EigenLayr allows re-use of staked capital to provide additional services, the marginal cost of capital to opt in to EigenLayr is zero</li>\n<li>Dapps can potentially can get the full Ethereum trust if they consime EigenLayr services (this is measurable)</li>\n<li>There is incentive alignment and you get internalized integrated trust back into a common protocol. Stakers can now earn revenue on ordering, execution, authentication, oracles, etc. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A subset of these ETH restakers can then opt-in to offer data availability sampling services to <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/i6W8Giz.png\">DataLayr,</a> with incentives and penalties (slashing). </p>\n\n<p>DataLayr uses <a href=\"https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1517137614741983234\">danksharding&#39;s state-of-the-art architecture,</a> but with a different opt-in model without a P2P network. It has all the benefits of data availability sampling where the more nodes there are, the more throughput is available, and it&#39;s trivially cheap to verify. It uses a similar architecture to DS but doesn&#39;t need the Ethereum core protocol to implement Danksharding or even blob txs.</p>\n\n<p>While the potential for security is orders of magnitudes higher than a new DA layer, it&#39;s only potential. It&#39;s unclear how much it will materialize, and how many ETH stakers will be incentivized to offer data availability services. Additionally, Ethereum&#39;s native DA isn&#39;t just secured by the stake, but also holds up if the stake turns malicious. The ability of full Ethereum nodes to reject an unavailable chain cannot be provided by DataLayr. Native DA is THE most secure as the chain will fork for unavailable blocks. When you transport DA from one chain to the other, the bridge is the security limit. With datalayr there is no bridge as DataLayr does not have a chain. But still native DA on ETH is the gold standard security as even if majority ETH is malicious, the chain will fork to follow the available chain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>EigenLayr lets ETH stakers &quot;restake&quot; their ETH (and even staking derivatives like stETH) and opt in to providing additional services in return for an additional return on their stake.</p>\n\n<p>DataLayr is a DA layer based on danksharding that attempts to leverage the security of ETH instead of a new token.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-22 23:00:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i5uj1g4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u9xss5","parent_id":"t3_u9xss5","score":87,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Ser, we're going to need you to slow down and save some alpha for Coindesk.

The value that can be unlocked from trying to bridge to the legacy world is small and costly compared to the ease of building and generating value in the metaverse.\n\nHowever, do expect this sort of bridging projects to have a constant basal level of news/buzz around it. The main reason is because that's immediately what a non-crypto-native thinks of when they think of blockchains.

Please be kind and have empathy -- we will make money but don&#39;t lose your humanity. </p>\n\n<p>Back to business. Rocketpool and RPL are not doing as well as I would have hoped. Perhaps not the best marketing or maybe LIDO is just too powerful. Who knows. I am in it for the long haul and not selling ETH or RPL. I believe in the idea of decentralization because it&#39;s the best chance for a return to the pre-commercialized internet. Truth be told it will probably not happen but believing is better than nothing. </p>\n\n<p>Ethereum is one lego block in the massive complex of fixing things. Our planet is rapidly dying, war is at our doorstep, and we are out of food. This is true but has always been true. We will survive and make a better world, not because we can but because we have to for ourselves and those we love. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the rambling but I really enjoy this place. I&#39;m going to have another tequila. Not selling my zombie lion btw.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-22 22:47:45","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-22 22:51:40","id":"i5ui14y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u9xss5","parent_id":"t3_u9xss5","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BroncoMontana78","body":"I\u2019m really struggling trying to rationalize Lido.

Twelve were built in the interwar years \u2014 including the first example, the Honolulu Clipper \u2014 but none survived past 1951. \n\nPan Am's \"Clippers\" were built for \"one-class\" luxury air travel, a necessity given the long duration of transoceanic flights. The seats could be converted into 36 bunks for overnight accommodation; with a cruising speed of 188 miles per hour (303 km/h) (typically flights at maximum gross weight were flown at 155 miles per hour (249 km/h)) in 1940, Pan Am's schedule San Francisco to Honolulu was 19 hours.\n\nThe 314s had a lounge and dining area, and the galleys were crewed by chefs from four-star hotels. Men and women were provided with separate dressing rooms, and white-coated stewards served five and six-course meals with gleaming silver service. The standard of luxury on Pan American's Boeing 314s has rarely been matched on heavier-than-air transport since then; they were a form of travel for the super-rich, priced at $675 (equivalent to $13,000 in 2021) round trip from New York to Southampton. Most of the flights were transpacific, with a one-way ticket from San Francisco to Hong Kong via the \"stepping-stone\" islands posted at $760 (equivalent to $15,000 in 2021). The Pan Am Boeing 314 Clippers brought exotic destinations like the Far East within reach of air travelers and came to represent the romance of flight.\n\nHawaii's central location in the Pacific made it a strategically important place; by the end of the Clipper era, Honolulu's airport was the third busiest in the United States. The airport continues to maintain two waterways for seaplane operations, designated 8W/26W and 4W/22W.\n\nCritical to the 314's success was the proficiency of its Pan Am flight crews, who were extremely skilled at long-distance, over-water flight operations and navigation. For training, many of the transpacific flights carried a second crew. Only the very best and most experienced flight crews were assigned Boeing 314 flying boat duty. Before coming aboard, all Pan Am captains as well as first and second officers had thousands of hours of flight time in other seaplanes and flying boats. Rigorous training in dead reckoning, timed turns, judging drift from sea current, celestial navigation, and radio navigation were conducted.\n\nToday, one can fly from the West Coast of the U.S. in six hours or so with several departures a day costing just a few hundred dollars, albeit without the gleaming silver service.
