As there was no known cure or treatment for the bacterial disease at the time and it was believed to be quite contagious, common practice around the world was to isolate people with leprosy to limit spread.\n\nHawaii established two settlements, commonly called leper colonies, on Molokai's Kalaupapa Peninsula in 1866. At its peak about 1,200 people were exiled to the peninsula, with about 8,500 over the life of the colonies. The peninsula was and is difficult to access, with some of the highest sea cliffs in the world at 3,600 feet (1,100 meters) limiting land access to a sole mule and hiking trail prone to landslides.\n\nBy the 1950s effective treatments of leprosy and better understanding of its transmission led to the dissolution of leper colonies, and Hawaii allowed residents of Kalaupapa to leave the colony in 1969. Many residents had built their life in Kalaupapa and chose to continue living on the peninsula for familiarity or to avoid the persistent stigma associated with leprosy and its scarring. As of 2020, 12 people who had had leprosy were living in Kalaupapa and were guaranteed care by the state.\n\nThe peninsula's difficult access and administration as an isolation facility led to Kalawao County's status as the smallest in the United States geographically (at 12 square miles of land (31 square kilometers)) and the second smallest by population (82 people as of 2020 to Loving County, Texas's 64 people). It was the last U.S. county to remain Covid-free, documenting its first case in December 2020.\n\nThe county does not have an elected government and is administered by the Hawaii Department of Health. It does, however, have a functioning post office with ZIP code 96742. Kalaupapa National Historical Park, coterminous with Kalawao County, was established in 1980 to preserve the history of the colonies and their setting. \n\nPrior to the Covid pandemic, the National Park Service permitted up to 100 visitors per day with a sponsor, usually one of the tour operators offering trips to Kalaupapa. Photography of residents and their property is strictly prohibited without their express written permission. Tours of Kalaupapa are now prohibited until further notice to protect the health of the remaining Hansen's disease patients, whose age averages 87 years. \n\nYou can chat with some of the last tourists to visit Kalaupapa at the Watch the Burn Sunset Party at [Sky Waikiki](https://www.skywaikiki.com/) rooftop bar (drinks and food included), as two confirmed [Hodlercon](https://hodlercon.com/) attendees visited the peninsula in March 2020.\n\nThe rest of Molokai is relatively undeveloped, with only 7,345 residents largely working in agriculture and without much tourism infrastructure. If you're flying to or from Maui or the Big Island, consider using Mokulele Airlines. Their interisland flights on eight-passenger prop planes stop in Molokai; the approach or departure gives you great views of the sea cliffs and the Kalaupapa Peninsula without disrupting residents.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Today&#39;s Hawaii fact includes something you <em>can&#39;t</em> do at Hodlercon but it adds some context and might be useful in bar trivia some day:</p>\n\n<p>People arriving from around the world to work on the Hawaiian Islands in the early 1800s brought with them diseases previously unencountered by residents, including Hansen&#39;s Disease (leprosy).

I was one of the fractionalionerizers on the video. Exciting times.

Much respect!\n\nMy advice to anyone dipping into this pool, pay close attention to slippage as it is not a deep LP. Ultimately the initial net worth of the fractionalized whole was around 4 ETH I think, or 0.000009-ish per EVMZ token, which represented the total value of our group buy of EVM#0, ~~the very first EVM minted~~ the first EVM in index order, a valuable meme number and which I interpret as a sign that the algorithm thinks it's the bestest one (thanks u/tech_consultant for the correction!). We thought this would be a worthwhile \"historic\" or meme-worthy candidate for this experiment given the symbolism of using the very first one. The total tokens represent the total number of pixels in the image, or 435,200, which we also thought was a fun symbolic token count. Many of us LP'd our shares (I LP'd my entire share, 43,520 tokens) after some fairly funny mistakes due to our ignorance of how Uni v3 pools worked. (Basically we accidentally pumped the price up to an insane value and then had to dump on ourselves to bring the price down to something not insane, so we didn't have to put more ETH than necessary into the LP to fund it). The MEVbot even got in the action and extracted a few dollars from us, lol. In the words of the Tiger King \"We may never financially recover from this\" but hey, it's for science!\n\nMy eventual hope is this is a proof of concept of a revenue generating mechanism for the DAO to perform with a larger pool of EVM's that it acquires, either through minting unclaimed Lions or buying them back from the market. (So that liquidity can be much deeper and enable more spread of ownership, and minimize slippage). It will enable people who maybe do not want to buy a whole EVM but still have exposure to the price to get in on the action.

The latter paints a world with crafty villains, and us smarter than average for seeing through them. It&#39;s a story we want to believe.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s one way I see it, anyway. I&#39;ve searched many times for data confirming the mistake theory and never found any. Commonly, you will see people indirectly or directly referencing a 2012 paper by Cormac Herley, a Microsoft researcher. However, this paper is purely theoretical. It suggests this is rational behavior for the scammer, but offers no additional data to suggest this is a strategy at play.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, every piece of investigative journalism you will see on African scams, interviewing the scammers, makes no mention of intentional mistakes. The scammers themselves, like the &quot;brouteurs&quot; of Ivory Coast, are proud to brag on social media about the money they extort. They will show their face on camera and happily explain their strategies. But in all that open bragging, no mention of purposeful spelling mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>Who knows. I&#39;d love to see more research on the topic.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-24 04:12:02","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-04-24 04:15:53","id":"i5zkrcm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uan7nk","parent_id":"t1_i5zcs4e","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/blocksandpixels","body":"I think I first read this in a chapter in Freakonomics, which was indeed based on the work you mentioned, so perhaps the intentional email misspelling is an urban legend.

Double signing is a slashable offense, so nodes running the bugged client would get slashed, and how much you get slashed correlates quadratically with how many people double-signed. [slashed.info](https://www.slashed.info/) has the math, but the % of client share it uses is outdated nowadays. To specifically ease your fears, a majority Prysm doesn't get to slash clients who didn't sign on a bugged block that Prysm thinks is valid.\n\nSo all else equal, you'd want your client to have a lower share if it's a client that happens to sign on an invalid block. But of course, a less popular client probably has fewer devs and a less audited codebase, so it's not like the odds of a major bug are perfectly equal across all clients. So your personal risk is very abstract to calculate. (There was a proof of concept thing a while back about running several client implementations in parallel and only signing on a block when a majority of them agrees, so that would probably be the best way to bring your personal odds of signing an invalid block as close to 0% as reasonably conceivable)\n\nOn the other hand, if the bug only involves syncing issues and for whatever reason the client stops signing on valid blocks, then you just get hit with the much lower inactivity penalties and you get to rejoin safely once the bug is resolved (or if you simply switch client). These penalties scale quadratically with how long the chain fails to finalize, which is why the diversity utopia involves every client having <33%, such that any one client bugging this way doesn't prevent finality and gives plenty of time for the bug to get fixed.\n\nThe biggest concern in the client diversity discussion is a >66% Prysm that instantly *finalizes* a bugged block, at which point we have to choose between bailing Prysm users out and making the bug an official part of the spec (and coding it in every other client), or no bailout and Prysm users lose their entire stake if they want to rejoin the One True Fork.
