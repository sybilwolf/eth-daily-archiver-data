Many entities do not run their own validators at all, they simply organize governance. Entities can also be operators, for example, I am an entity and an operator, but large providers run their validators under multiple operators. Examples of entities are Lido, Rocket Pool, Coinbase, and Kraken.\n\nAn operator= The service running the actual validators. You can look at [Lido public documents](https://research.lido.fi/c/node-operators/12) to find that they have about 22 operators, examples are Blockdaemon, Chainlayer, Stakely, HashQuark. These are far less likely to be publicly known names and they don't necessarily accept deposits directly, instead, they run validators for Entities and collect a fee for the service. We obviously look for high operator diversity, it's one of the reasons I love Rocket Pool - they have over a thousand operators on their permissionless network.\n\nRight now, the beacon chain is fine on operator diversity, I use https://rated.network for this info and I can see that the largest operator runs 12% (still pretty scary), but you'll see that even large operators run less than 1% of the network. Ideally, no operator would be larger than 1%, but even with our current operator diversity it would take more than 40 operators to reach 66%.\n\nEntity diversity is another story. We need entity diversity to ensure that one entity (or a small cabal of entities) doesn't extort the network through governance. The goal that I'm stating publicly is that no entity should control more than 22% of validators, that means that at an absolute minimum, four entities would need to collaborate to reach 66%. With our current network distribution, it would take 10 entities to reach that 66% threshold, but if Lido continues to grow at its current velocity, this number could fall quickly. It's not what we'd refer to as an \"existential threat\", but it does weigh on decentralization.\n\nThe obvious risk is that rogue entities could fork the chain with greater than 66% of the validators, but that's realistically not likely since they'd be called out publicly. **The REAL risk is adoption stagnation - that is, nation-states and corporate actors who might be likely to use Ethereum in the future could be dissuaded** because the chain isn't credibly neutral.

Super informative, super optimistic about our collab with their team. \n\nBrief notes: \n\nRe: staking as a service generally: EVMavericks are fucking trailblazers.  According to the Rocketpool team, We're the first organization proposing collective staking as a service-- let alone doing so as a non-profit, or doing so in the service of greater public goods. Don't discount the power of the pride. \n\nRe: pooling of RPL for mininode insurance: a novel concept and not necessarily one that's been considered before. Pooling of ETH is definitely considered, still a work in progress. Maybe possible in two ways with respect to RPL rewards. \n\nfirst would be as an extension of the \"Pawn Stars\" splitter contract, which allows pro-rata distribution of rewards. This was envisioned as a two-party system (someone with ETH and someone with RPL) but it sounds like it may be possible to extend that. \n\nsecond would be as part of the v 1.1 update, the so-called \"Stake on behalf of\" functionality, which allows the direction of rewards to the same address that operates the nodes. This was set up as a gas-saving measure, but could potentially allow for us to build a separate contract that would split rewards, and have the rewards sent explicitly to that.\n\nRe: grants and community allocations from the Rocketpool treasury, they have a budget but are still in the nascent stages of defining how it will be allocated.

I'd also like to see levels of RPL staked alongside the ETH actually adjust the \"leverage\" allowed to a node operator.  AKA the more RPL staked behind a node operator less ETH the node operator would need to provide.  So lets say you have 10 eth worth of RPL backing you, you may only need 8 ETH in order to spin up a 32 eth validator (meaning 24 rETH is created).\n\nCurrent rETH security model --> Node operator ETH staked + Node operator RPL staked = at least 17.6 eth equivalent. With a 16 eth floor on node operator ETH staked.\n\nNow we've disaggregated it to Node operator ETH staked + (community/whale RPL staked) = at least 17.6 eth equivalent.

Also, the ETH price will rise (as more and more is bought with borrowed USD to stake), and as that happens, it will cost more and more in USD terms to get the same ETH yield both in percentage terms (as staking yields compress) and absolute terms (because you need more and more USD to get 1 ETH in yield as ETH price goes up, even if staking yield is stable). \n\nAnyway, what this will mean is another source of demand post-Merge for ETH and should see a SHARP rise in the ETH price before it settles at a new stable staking yield. \n\nI've never seen this angle discussed before - I read the whole Squish Chaos paper and subsequent followups and I don't think this was mentioned, although it was so long that I may have forgotten it - until now I thought that was the authoritative take on supply/demand mechanics triggered by the Merge. \n\nThe details are in the","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This tweet thread was posted in the Daily a few days ago, but I wanted to repost it and give it some more visibility - talking about another angle why the Merge is more bullish than we think:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MisterKeegan/status/1508082684798644237?cxt=HHwWmsC59cXN5O0pAAAA\">https://twitter.com/MisterKeegan/status/1508082684798644237?cxt=HHwWmsC59cXN5O0pAAAA</a></p>\n\n<p>Basically we&#39;re used to talking about the Merge as being bullish because of the incoming supply shock and delay to withdrawals etc. But there&#39;s another angle entirely to it - which is playing the carry trade when there is a Risk Free Rate within the Ethereum ecosystem when staking plus withdrawal goes live (the guaranteed rate which you can get from the protocol itself with basically no risk of default). </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not all good - there is likely to be a huge rush of ETH into staking (moderated by the queue which is not mentioned in the thread) to take advantage of the initial high staking rewards, which is great for ETH but likely to mean large amounts of capital leaving the rest of DeFi and TVLs collapsing (also probably - my addition - a lot of projects collapsing on the ETH ratio - good time to pick up long term bargains).</p>\n\n<p>The most interesting bit to me (around Tweet 13 onwards) is the discussion of the carry trade - basically if the USD Risk Free Rate is 1.6% (which it is, for 1 year Treasuries) but the ETH risk free rate is 10%, then it is a no-brainer to borrow USD to buy ETH and stake ETH for the 10% rate - it&#39;s basically free money (unless the ETH price collapses in USD terms which is pretty unlikely early on). </p>\n\n<p>This doesn&#39;t last forever - what will happen is that USD borrowing rates will rise and raise the USD RFR  (in theory - in practice, I doubt borrowing volumes for the ETH carry trade will have any meaningful impact on USD rates), and more importantly, the ETH staking yields will fall as supply increases and makes the trade less profitable/attractive, because the delta between the USD RFR and ETH RFR will narrow.

Pipeline is known for huge waves that break in shallow water just above a sharp and cavernous reef, forming large, hollow, thick curls of water that surfers can tube ride. There are three reefs at Pipeline in progressively deeper water farther out to sea that activate according to the increasing size of approaching ocean swells.\n\nThe location's compound name combines the name of the surf break (Pipeline) with the name of the beach fronting it (Banzai Beach). It got its name in December 1961, when surfing legend producer Bruce Brown was driving up north with Californians Phil Edwards and Mike Diffenderfer. Bruce stopped at the then-unnamed site to film Phil catching several waves. At the time, there was a construction project on an underground pipeline on adjacent Kamehameha Highway, and Mike made the suggestion to name the break \"Pipeline.\" The name was first used in Bruce Brown's movie Surfing Hollow Days. It also lent its name to a 1963 hit Pipeline by surf music rockers The Chantays.\n\nNumerous surfers and photographers have been killed at Pipeline, including Jon Mozo and Tahitian Malik Joyeux, who was famous for his heavy charging (gutsy surfing) at Teahupo'o. Many people have died or been seriously injured at Pipeline. Pipeline has been called one of the world's deadliest waves. Its average wave is 9 feet (3 meters), but it can be as tall as 20 feet (6 meters). Especially perilous are sections of shallow reef known as \"Off the Wall\" and \"Backdoor.\"\n\nThe top surfing competitions at this spot include the Pipe Masters (board surfing), the Volcom Pipe Pro, the IBA Pipeline Pro (bodyboarding), and the Pipeline Bodysurfing Classic. Surfers can also submit videos to Surfline's Wave of the Winter competition. The competition focuses on beaches on Oahu's North Shore, including Pipeline.\n\nThough the most challenging surfing is in the stormy winter months, experienced surfers take on Pipeline throughout the year, including during [Hodlercon](https://hodlercon.com/) (June 17-26). It's about an hour by car or about two and a half hours by bus from Waikiki (travel times are very approximate; Oahu traffic gets congested at times).\n\nYou can watch the waves roll in live (I think) at [https://www.surfnewsnetwork.com/webcam/pipeline/](https://www.surfnewsnetwork.com/webcam/pipeline/) or see surfers in archived webcam footage at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY5RYp4sxYc](https://explore.org/livecams/hawaii/hawaii-pipeline-cam)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzai\\_Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzai_Pipeline)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The Banzai Pipeline, or simply Pipeline or Pipe, is a surf reef break located in Hawaii, off Ehukai Beach Park on Oahu&#39;s North Shore.

As a result, L2 did not receive SNX inflationary rewards for this week, while L1 did because it does not have to interact with a bridge (inflationary SNX is minted on L1, and then bridged to L2).</p>\n\n<p>This is a brand new process, and working on improving the workflow and automating the manual task is a priority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This likely has something to do with it</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-27 15:57:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6gowl5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ucvqli","parent_id":"t1_i6gkh3r","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/UnitedGwei","body":"You are awesome!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You are awesome!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-27 16:12:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6gqu4h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ucvqli","parent_id":"t1_i6gowl5","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Thank you, so are you!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you, so are you!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-27 16:14:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6gr5oh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ucvqli","parent_id":"t1_i6gqu4h","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/MorganZero","body":"Serious question - is there literally any valid reason to hold ETH, as opposed to rETH?\n\nEdit: just for hodling\u2019s sake, I mean.
