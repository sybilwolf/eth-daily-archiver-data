Let's do today a new way, in sections.\n\nNear-Term:\n\nEver increasing chance markets bounce here. Everything is at major support. Everyone is fearful and bearish. Assets are oversold across the board. Bullish divergences in RSI, MACD, NAMO (equities). The likelihood of a local bottom and bounce here is very high. Entirely possible we see SPY rally strong back up to 435 resistance, especially since max pain for the week is 433. That could mean $40.5k or $41.5k for grandpa.\n\nEarnings:\n\nA major reason for the abovementioned bounce? Today's earnings. The big one. The titans of commerce. The most powerful company on Earth. The leader of consumer sales, itself a whopping 30% of the U.S. economy. Every index, asset, and sector is waiting with bated breath for 4:10pm NYC time. You all know who I'm talking about.\n\nDOMINO'S PIZZA.\n\nKidding. Everyone knows DPZ reports before market in just a few hours.\n\nNo, it's Apple and Amazon. Nothing will make its move until then. Apple always beats. They've missed just once in ten years. Amazon can miss, but I think that would only dampen a rally not kill it. Speculating, though. So the question is with Microsoft performing well (albeit with a nasty bear hammer yesterday), Facebook recovering explosively, and a presumed Apple beat, will the ensuing bear rally be enough to break the downtrend? I don't think so, but price action will tell us.\n\nIn the highly unlikely event of an Apple miss, the markets will implode and S&P will head toward 4000 and below before you can even say \"iPhone\". Again, probably not happening.\n\nHonorable Thursday Mentions: Comcast, Intel, Merck, Caterpillar, Sanofi, Northrop Grumman, McDonalds, Mastercard, US Steel, Nokia, Overstock, and Twitter\r  \n\r  \nFRI - Exxon, Chevron, Phillips (the oil one), Charter, Bristol Myers, Honeywell, AstraZeneca, Colgate-Palmolive, AON\n\nIndicators:\n\nVIX is still way up there above 30 so turmoil abounds. It also just got a fresh golden cross on the daily, suggesting 1-3 months of continued volatility. *Volatility* not necessarily *downside*. I'd just plan for crazy rallies and dumps through summer at this juncture. And note that we still STILL have not seen VIX close that mythical gap at 45 from the Covid plunge. Of course, something like an Apple whiff would take care of that but I think it's more likely an overall market capitulation later in May does the trick.\n\nThe dollar index DXY (103.35) is at historic levels. Close a daily candle here and it'd be the first since before the Iraq War. Next major resistances at 107/108 (and even higher ones at 113 and 121) though we're unlikely to see them. A peak and turnaround back down should coincide with a fresh risk-on market, the length of which is unknown.\n\nThis is gonna be a wild day.
