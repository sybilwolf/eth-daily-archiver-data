But i have to question why most people in crypto land put so much emphasis on decentralization for decentralization sake. Decentralization was always the means not the end.\n\nWhen Satoshi launched bitcoin the idea was that decentralization will make it harder for nation states to censor transactions. It's essentially a distributed risk model very similar to BitTorrent. The general idea being that in western democracies it's much harder to go after large segments of the population then it is to shut down a single company.\n\nWhere this distributed risk model can and already has broken down is in two places. \n\nFirst as we saw during the covid era, lot of rights we thought we had got taken away from us in the name of a greater threat. Regardless of whether you think that decision was right or wrong you can't deny that when a state indefinitely puts its population on house arrest they can do pretty much anything. Just thinking out loud here, say crypto was used to fund some nefarious purpose like a major terror attack, I can easily see them over-reacting and using the emergency as a way to ban or severely restrict it.\n\nThe general thinking in crypto is that they can't do this because anyone can spin up a node and keep the network alive. But this thinking is based on the pre-2020 world where mass repression against a large chunk of the population was unthinkable in a western democracy. How many people will run a node if its made illegal and punishable by prison time? They already had the entire population under house arrest for months without major blowback. Do you really think there will be mass outcry for some jailed terrorist supporting scum as the state will undoubtedly try to portray them?\n\nLook at how most people in this sub act around tax time, I'd say 99% of crypto people will quit using it if it's made illegal. The rest will be easy to deal with in a hostile environment created by mass media. \n\nHow many of you have donated to libertarian or freedom-fighting causes? There's over one trillion in this space, if only a fraction of that was spent on libertarian causes maybe they'd win once in a while and make a difference. A state that has no limits will try to smother anything that it sees as a threat, which crypto certainly is.\n\nSecond major issue that threatens the decentralization risk model is self-censorship. This is very prominent in all of crypto and even in the defi space. You have protocols banning entire countries or regions just because the US has some individuals from said country or region on its sanctions list. Then you have almost a blanket ban of Americans from participating in leveraged trading defi protocols. \n\nThere's almost no public outcry or blowback when these self-censorship events occur. The response is always that you can start your own protocol so this is no big deal. But I can't code and even if I did I can't conjure up the liquidity that uniswap or dydx has. It's like saying to someone just start your own Amazon, it's absurd. \n\nWhen uniswap banned some tokens that US regulators didn't like we were told that it's just a front-end ban, you could still interact with those contracts. But how many of us can directly interact with a smart contract without a website making this process easy? And furthermore how much of the liquidity of those trading pools stayed after their removal from the website? I'd guess most of it was gone the next day, probably suffering heavy losses in the process.\n\nWe need to spend lot more energy on convincing protocols to stop self-censoring then we do on decentralizing staking. If protocol creators fear legal reprecussions they should go anonymous. But a lot of times this is a simple cost/benefit analysis for them. If they encounter almost zero blowback when they ban entire countries then they will keep doing it. On the other hand if a significant portion of us choses to boycott these protocols and express our dissatisfaction online, they will be a lot more careful about self-censoring in the future.\n\nTo be clear both staking decentralization and self-censorship are important but one is focusing on the means while the other is focused on the goal. The goal was never decentralization, it was censorship resistance. And if we're being honest to ourselves this is a battle that has been largely lost, by not being fought at all.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you for fighting this fight.

Faced with this scenario, on January 10, 1942, (that's 34 calendar days after the attack) Military Governor Delos Carleton Emmons issued an order to recall all regular U.S. currency in the islands, save for set caps on how much money both individuals ($200 or $4,078 in 2022 dollars) and businesses ($500 or $10,195 in 2022; save extra currency for payroll purposes) could possess at any time.\n\nOn June 25, 1942, new overprinted notes were first issued. Series 1935A $1 silver certificate, Series 1934 $5 and $20 Federal Reserve Notes, and Series 1934A $5, $10, and $20 Federal Reserve Notes from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco were issued with brown treasury seals and serial numbers. Overprints of the word HAWAII were made; two small overprints to the sides of the obverse of the note between the border and both the treasury seal and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco seal, and large outlined Hawaii lettering dominating the reverse.\n\nThe purpose was that should there have been an Imperial Japanese invasion of the islands, the U.S. government could immediately declare any Hawaii-printed notes worthless, due to their easy identification. With this issue, military officials made the use of non-overprinted notes redundant and ordered all Hawaii residents to turn in regular notes for Hawaii overprinted notes by July 15, 1942. Beginning on August 15, 1942, no other paper U.S. currency could be used except under special permission.\n\nFaced with a $200 million stockpile of U.S. currency, military officials opted to destroy all the recalled regular currency instead of overcoming the logistical problems of shipping the notes back to the mainland. At first, a local crematorium was pressed into service to burn the notes.

Faced with this scenario, on January 10, 1942, (that&#39;s 34 calendar days after the attack) Military Governor Delos Carleton Emmons issued an order to recall all regular U.S. currency in the islands, save for set caps on how much money both individuals ($200 or $4,078 in 2022 dollars) and businesses ($500 or $10,195 in 2022; save extra currency for payroll purposes) could possess at any time.</p>\n\n<p>On June 25, 1942, new overprinted notes were first issued. Series 1935A $1 silver certificate, Series 1934 $5 and $20 Federal Reserve Notes, and Series 1934A $5, $10, and $20 Federal Reserve Notes from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco were issued with brown treasury seals and serial numbers. Overprints of the word HAWAII were made; two small overprints to the sides of the obverse of the note between the border and both the treasury seal and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco seal, and large outlined Hawaii lettering dominating the reverse.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose was that should there have been an Imperial Japanese invasion of the islands, the U.S. government could immediately declare any Hawaii-printed notes worthless, due to their easy identification. With this issue, military officials made the use of non-overprinted notes redundant and ordered all Hawaii residents to turn in regular notes for Hawaii overprinted notes by July 15, 1942. Beginning on August 15, 1942, no other paper U.S. currency could be used except under special permission.</p>\n\n<p>Faced with a $200 million stockpile of U.S. currency, military officials opted to destroy all the recalled regular currency instead of overcoming the logistical problems of shipping the notes back to the mainland. At first, a local crematorium was pressed into service to burn the notes.  Destruction of the notes was slow, and pressed with time, the bigger furnaces of the Aiea sugar mill were requisitioned to help burn the currency.</p>\n\n<p>The notes and issuance continued in use until October 21, 1944; by April 1946, notes were being recalled. Many notes were saved as curios and souvenirs by servicemen.</p>\n\n<p>The invasion of the main islands never came, so the notes were never demonetized and they remain legal tender at face value.

They take that into the stock market for gains on this bear market, scooping up blue chip companies for cheap.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-29 06:59:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6o0k7o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ueee53","parent_id":"t1_i6nxi9u","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Ahh now I got what you mean.\n\nWhile there is definitely market manipulation in crypto and some of what you described is probably happening, I think it mostly comes down to the volatility of the asset class.\n\nUntil crypto decouples from stocks, or preferably ETH becoming its own asset class entirely, the price will generally reflect the broader markets.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ahh now I got what you mean.</p>\n\n<p>While there is definitely market manipulation in crypto and some of what you described is probably happening, I think it mostly comes down to the volatility of the asset class.</p>\n\n<p>Until crypto decouples from stocks, or preferably ETH becoming its own asset class entirely, the price will generally reflect the broader markets.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-29 07:16:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6o2yq2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ueee53","parent_id":"t1_i6o0k7o","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/epic_trader","body":"No offense but I think you're imagining things that aren't there.
