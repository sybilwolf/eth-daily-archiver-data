The most boisterous has to be the chicken.\n\n\r  \nPolynesians arriving on the Hawaiian Islands more than 800 years ago introduced an ancestor of the chicken, red junglefowl. The birds survived on the islands along with humans, living relatively quiet lives. In the 19th and 20th centuries people imported domesticated chickens to the islands for meat and egg production.\n\n\r  \nThen, local lore and DNA studies say, hurricanes Iwa (1982) and Iniki (1992) jailbroke captive chickens. These chickens did as chickens do and soon interbred with extant junglefowl. Kauai was the first island overrun by the fowl, which crow all hours of the day and night, but the other major islands may have been protected by pressure from introduced mongooses that haven't made it to Kauai.\n\n\r  \nNow feral chicken populations are up and they've become a nuisance on other islands, including Hodlercon's host, Oahu. State Senator Bennette Misalucha this year introduced state Senate Bill 2195, which if passed into law would create a five-year pilot program to eradicate feral chickens using feed laced with contraceptives.

The most boisterous has to be the chicken.</p>\n\n<p>Polynesians arriving on the Hawaiian Islands more than 800 years ago introduced an ancestor of the chicken, red junglefowl. The birds survived on the islands along with humans, living relatively quiet lives. In the 19th and 20th centuries people imported domesticated chickens to the islands for meat and egg production.</p>\n\n<p>Then, local lore and DNA studies say, hurricanes Iwa (1982) and Iniki (1992) jailbroke captive chickens. These chickens did as chickens do and soon interbred with extant junglefowl.

I have recently grown to appreciate the potential of POAP (partly due to running into Patricio, the founder, in my coworking space, hehe). But its the idea of POAP as an authentication method that impressed me. Your POAP collection is absolutely unique to you like a fingerprint and there is no way to fake it. I know that might cause a few distopian privacy worries but one could confirm identity through ZK proofs without revealing much about actual POAP-owning account. It is super cool. Login-with-POAP.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-30 09:25:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6szix1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uf42gy","parent_id":"t3_uf42gy","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/RockItGuyDC","body":"I am really excited for some \"zk-proof of unique humanity\", or whatever, solutions to come about.
