I didn\u2019t get I to crypto until early 21, so I\u2019ve been through two pretty big crashes, with last spring/summer being a pretty violent drop and the current one more of the slow death variety. I learned a lot about myself last year, that I could manage my emotions (sleep at night) after a 60% correction and increase my DCA at lower prices. Honestly it wasn\u2019t that difficult (just my personal emotional/mental experience). It helped tremendously to have a written crypto investment thesis that outlined this scenario and what my response would be. I just did what Id planned to do. Now, what if the current slide goes to 80% with ETH under 1k or even lower? Would I continue to hodl, increase my DCA, our would I capitulate? Im confident Its the former (hodl) but I can\u2019t be sure until I experience that price action and all the emotions it would produce. Unfortunately I\u2019d say there are definitely a lot of self proclaimed hodlers out there (mostly relative newbs - class of 21) who don\u2019t fully know themselves yet, are sitting on large unrealized losses, and will turn into sellers if things keep going south. In the end tho there is a large and ever growing group of diehards (many in this sub) most of whom have been through a bear or two and won\u2019t sell no matter what. Add in growing institutional interest and it\u2019s likely that major capitulations of the past won\u2019t be repeated. What\u2019s the lowest we could go? Who knows but something like $1k feels about right as a worst case scenario.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-01 09:26:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6x5lhg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ufshns","parent_id":"t1_i6wu0je","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/csasker","body":"after reading the 20 identical posts on https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/ again and again for each market move, I think I realize that like 90% of all crypto discussions would be solved or not needed if people said if their were more of an investor or more of a trader\n\nmost of the times there is just people arguing from a different point of view, without understanding what the other side is coming from\n\nI think it's quite similar with ETH too, this community have a more long term view on things and put things like governance on chain in high regard compared to pump style tokenomics for projects or new options platforms","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>after reading the 20 identical posts on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/</a> again and again for each market move, I think I realize that like 90% of all crypto discussions would be solved or not needed if people said if their were more of an investor or more of a trader</p>\n\n<p>most of the times there is just people arguing from a different point of view, without understanding what the other side is coming from</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s quite similar with ETH too, this community have a more long term view on things and put things like governance on chain in high regard compared to pump style tokenomics for projects or new options platforms</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-01 03:09:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6w1xhz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ufshns","parent_id":"t3_ufshns","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/NoDesinformatziya","body":"You could mostly just ignore /cc because they don't even understand what they're buying 95 percent of the time.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You could mostly just ignore /cc because they don&#39;t even understand what they&#39;re buying 95 percent of the time.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-01 09:30:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6x651t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ufshns","parent_id":"t1_i6w1xhz","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/suclearnub","body":"I needed this cucumber.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I needed this cucumber.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-01 08:30:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6wxudo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ufshns","parent_id":"t3_ufshns","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Set1Less","body":"Looks like Near has been attacked too...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AlexAuroraDev/status/1520711071518142464\n\nEarly to tell buy maybe another eth killa bites the dust?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Looks like Near has been attacked too...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexAuroraDev/status/1520711071518142464\">https://twitter.com/AlexAuroraDev/status/1520711071518142464</a></p>\n\n<p>Early to tell buy maybe another eth killa bites the dust?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-01 09:45:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6x89ge","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ufshns","parent_id":"t3_ufshns","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Maswasnos","body":"Seems like funds are safe according to a reply on that Tweet.

One that would still be impossible for a classic computer to crack, but easier for a quantum computer to crack than an actual wallet's private key.

Like bro, I love you Justin but fuck you on this, but his reasoning is basically that it doesn't matter how quantum safe your own funds are if a huge chunk of the supply is dormant and up for grabs for anyone with a quantum computer, which would most likely be built by a nation-state not too keen on keeping Ethereum around. \n\nBut thankfully there are [other options](https://ethresear.ch/t/quantum-disaster-recovery/4042) like simply freezing those dormant funds from being spent by the usual means and only allowing them to be spent if you can prove through a zkSTARK that you know a 12-24 word seed phrase with a proper derivation path that leads to a private key that leads to the wallet address. Since all that BIP39 crap is hash based, no quantum computer could possibly reverse-engineer the initial seed words that generated a given key and the zkSTARK would leak no information beyond a proof of knowledge, so we'd have total guarantee that the person transfering the funds to a quantum-proof wallet is the legitimate owner. Still sucks for the minority of vanity wallets or wallets who's exposed key wasn't generated by a BIP39 seed phrase, maybe they can do their own zkSTARK but I have no clue how generalized these things can get. Come to think of it, our prepper from earlier who never exposed his public key could get away by [just crafting a zkSTARK](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeufhgp/?context=1) that proves he knows his private key without ever revealing it.

Fortunately I already have funds on xDAI so I&#39;m happy to just swap it for WETH on Honeyswap and leave it on xDAI with my other funds there. This is definitely the way to go if you already have funds on xDAI. Even if not, its pretty trivial to swap some of the EVMOS for DAI on Diffusion.fi, send that to xDAI on Connext to fund your xDAI wallet (xDAI/DAI is the native token which pays the gas fee) and then send over the rest of the airdropped funds in your chosen currency (or just send it all as xDAI to save time).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-01 05:33:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i6wd3ki","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ufshns","parent_id":"t1_i6wbj18","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/reuptaken","body":"I'm trying Nomad and I'm seeing 55 min. left message for 3 hrs or more.
