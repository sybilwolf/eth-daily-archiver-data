This post is targeted at more of a developer audience than my usual writings. Whatever technical jargon is here shouldn\u2019t distract from the point too much if you just skim past it and keep reading.\n\nWhenever I see the too-often FUD about some country evicting miners, KYCing wallets, or suing some company or other I repeat this mantra: the tide of technology cannot be stopped. Technology is like a liquid that erodes whatever barriers you erect. It seeps through the cracks of the thickest stone wall. Trying to suppress it is like trying to compress a balloon with your hands; wherever your hands aren\u2019t, the air comes popping out. There is no barrier you can put in place to stop the tide of technology. Nations may be able to slow progress a bit, at great expense to themselves, but their failure is inevitable.\n\nThis is as true for blockchains as it was for the internet in China, [electricity](https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/an-unrestrained-demon-a-lightbulb-demon-is-displayed-as-a-news-photo/517351124), and the [invention of writing](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1636/1636-h/1636-h.htm#2H_4_0002). Every major technology has had it\u2019s objectors, and the luddites of yesteryear lost as surely as the luddites of today will.\n\n> Anything that is in the world when you\u2019re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that\u2019s invented between when you\u2019re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you\u2019re thirty-five is against the natural order of things. -Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt\n\nWe are already past the inflection point where it would be deeply unpopular to ban crypto. This technology is being adopted faster than the internet. [We\u2019re on track to reach a billion users in 3-5 years](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1392939136689053699). We are at the bottom of the S curve, staring at a 6 billion user cliff and a once-in-an-ever opportunity. This isn\u2019t just the rise of a new company or a new commodity; this is the birth of an entirely new asset class. This is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.\n\nBacking this asset class is a new technology. The capabilities of this new technology don\u2019t just offer an order of magnitude difference from its\u2019 predecessors; this technology enables categorically new possibilities, otherwise unobtainable capabilities. If you\u2019re a tech company, consider a pitch for a data store technology with the following attributes:\n\n* An append-only data stream with built-in rollup view of most recent state.\n* Six-sigma reliability without dev-ops engineering costs.\n* Pay-as-you-go, write-once, read-**forever** data.\n* Native billing mechanisms that shift operational costs to the service beneficiary rather than the host. Imagine if your customers were willing and able to pay for your AWS Lambda function calls.\n* Unprecedented RBAC controls over organizational data and credentials. Multi-signature schemes that can entirely negate the impact of phishing attacks. Access control rules down to row-level granularity without having to engineer your own data access layer.\n* Universal RPC interface offering composability with thousands of applications. Your application won\u2019t need to create an account on a hundred websites, you won\u2019t need manage a half-dozen agreements for jdbc drivers, or integrate dozens of AWS products into a data pipeline.\n\nNothing is free of course. Whomever is making the call is paying for the ops cost for all of this, there will of course be developer friction learning yet another tech stack, and naturally there will still be the usual costs for interfaces and hosting any off-chain resources but there are many possibilities that are open for you when you have a direct payment channel to/from each of your users, a single source of truth you and your customers can agree to share without the usual counter-party risk that entails, and immediate access to dozens of financial functions that settle instantly.\n\nThese qualities enable [24-7 markets](https://app.uniswap.org/) that can be accessed by anyone at any time for any reason, forgery-resistant [supply chain tracking](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/connectors/erp-connector-sap-microsoft-dynamics) that spans national and company borders, legal attestation and [identification systems](https://myidalliance.org/en/) with provably secure data releases not subject to custodial risk, and financially integrated applications that remove settlement times and national boundaries entirely. Connect directly with your customers without risking leaking their personal information, without an intermediary like Visa or Paypal adding friction and labyrinthine dispute resolution processes, and without having to worry about the legal landscape in each and every jurisdiction in the world. [Integrate IoT devices](https://mirror.xyz/dayofniagra.eth/yRJuK0_4cOiNoW0RPAjJd4w9xUDqH-srF4yTEfJrRsw) without layer upon layer of architecture or the inter-company political risk of a middleman.\n\nEverything mentioned above is available to you without having to buy anything more than the block space. I haven\u2019t even mentioned a coin or token above. This isn\u2019t a sales pitch for cryptocurrencies; you can use dollar equivalents at every level of your application if you choose and reap the benefits of this technology anyway.\n\nThese are features that are *desirable* regardless of what any government does or does not like. Regardless of how you feel about it, it is already here, and it\u2019s not going away. If your company ignores this, your competitors will not. If your nation bans this, the productivity will just go overseas. There are tens of thousands active developers working on applications for the Ethereum Blockchain alone. Has any technology ever reached this degree of penetration and then quietly gone away? Does [this chart](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*92XyUw_XOcWofleF2VtZUQ.png) look bearish to you?\n\nIf you\u2019re just approaching this space from the fringes what you have probably heard about is an endless stream of hacks and scams. It\u2019s true, there are multi-million dollar losses that occur on a seemingly weekly basis here. The finality guarantees mentioned above make fertile ground for attackers. It may surprise you then to hear that, culturally, this is the most optimistic group of people I have ever encountered. Despite the potential for misuse and the constant threat of attack, the opportunities so far outweigh the risks that people are positively brimming with excitement. Drop by a hackathon at a conference sometime, the energy is palpable.\n\nSometimes following this space feels like a frenzied land-grab in a new continent. We are thousands of ships exploring, surveying, and settling. There are riches aplenty for the taking but there are also dangers as with any uncharted territory. Tales of shipwrecks and piracy are common. Fear sells after all. The loudest tales though are of those who have struck gold or made a new village here. Every shipwreck just serves as a lesson to the next ships of the impending dangers. The bones of the ocean rising to greet new visitors. In the end though we are explorers and this is the frontier. We know the risks and we are here anyway.\n\nOn a final parting note, there is a term we have for the peculiar mental-state people assume when they investigate this space in earnest. They get \u201cred-pilled\u201d. You\u2019ll commonly hear the phrase going down [The Rabbit Hole](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole). It\u2019s surprisingly apt. Things you will learn here will make the mundane seem strange. We regularly engage in conversation on everything from philosophy and [morality](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame/), to academic [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault) and [coordination/governance mechanisms](https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-deep-dive-into-futarchy-what-national-governments-and-private-organisations-can-learn-from-a-9408aa2fb887), to [financial primitives](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/rate-speculation-platforms/) and the [nature of money](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/ether-a-new-model-for-money), to highly technical [software architecture design](https://polynya.medium.com/). At some point on the journey you\u2019ll look at the world and what used to be normal will look insane and corrupt. It\u2019s a true looking-glass moment; you'll never be the same after it.\n\nSelf-serving [link](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-tide-of-technology/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Update on my previous post with a lot more follow up links for the curious, pretty pictures, and a message to any new technical entrants to our space.

Technology is like a liquid that erodes whatever barriers you erect. It seeps through the cracks of the thickest stone wall. Trying to suppress it is like trying to compress a balloon with your hands; wherever your hands aren\u2019t, the air comes popping out. There is no barrier you can put in place to stop the tide of technology. Nations may be able to slow progress a bit, at great expense to themselves, but their failure is inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>This is as true for blockchains as it was for the internet in China, <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/an-unrestrained-demon-a-lightbulb-demon-is-displayed-as-a-news-photo/517351124\">electricity</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1636/1636-h/1636-h.htm#2H_4_0002\">invention of writing</a>. Every major technology has had it\u2019s objectors, and the luddites of yesteryear lost as surely as the luddites of today will.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anything that is in the world when you\u2019re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that\u2019s invented between when you\u2019re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you\u2019re thirty-five is against the natural order of things. -Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We are already past the inflection point where it would be deeply unpopular to ban crypto. This technology is being adopted faster than the internet. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1392939136689053699\">We\u2019re on track to reach a billion users in 3-5 years</a>. We are at the bottom of the S curve, staring at a 6 billion user cliff and a once-in-an-ever opportunity. This isn\u2019t just the rise of a new company or a new commodity; this is the birth of an entirely new asset class. This is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Backing this asset class is a new technology. The capabilities of this new technology don\u2019t just offer an order of magnitude difference from its\u2019 predecessors; this technology enables categorically new possibilities, otherwise unobtainable capabilities. If you\u2019re a tech company, consider a pitch for a data store technology with the following attributes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An append-only data stream with built-in rollup view of most recent state.</li>\n<li>Six-sigma reliability without dev-ops engineering costs.</li>\n<li>Pay-as-you-go, write-once, read-<strong>forever</strong> data.</li>\n<li>Native billing mechanisms that shift operational costs to the service beneficiary rather than the host. Imagine if your customers were willing and able to pay for your AWS Lambda function calls.</li>\n<li>Unprecedented RBAC controls over organizational data and credentials. Multi-signature schemes that can entirely negate the impact of phishing attacks. Access control rules down to row-level granularity without having to engineer your own data access layer.</li>\n<li>Universal RPC interface offering composability with thousands of applications. Your application won\u2019t need to create an account on a hundred websites, you won\u2019t need manage a half-dozen agreements for jdbc drivers, or integrate dozens of AWS products into a data pipeline.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nothing is free of course. Whomever is making the call is paying for the ops cost for all of this, there will of course be developer friction learning yet another tech stack, and naturally there will still be the usual costs for interfaces and hosting any off-chain resources but there are many possibilities that are open for you when you have a direct payment channel to/from each of your users, a single source of truth you and your customers can agree to share without the usual counter-party risk that entails, and immediate access to dozens of financial functions that settle instantly.</p>\n\n<p>These qualities enable <a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/\">24-7 markets</a> that can be accessed by anyone at any time for any reason, forgery-resistant <a href=\"https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/connectors/erp-connector-sap-microsoft-dynamics\">supply chain tracking</a> that spans national and company borders, legal attestation and <a href=\"https://myidalliance.org/en/\">identification systems</a> with provably secure data releases not subject to custodial risk, and financially integrated applications that remove settlement times and national boundaries entirely. Connect directly with your customers without risking leaking their personal information, without an intermediary like Visa or Paypal adding friction and labyrinthine dispute resolution processes, and without having to worry about the legal landscape in each and every jurisdiction in the world. <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/dayofniagra.eth/yRJuK0_4cOiNoW0RPAjJd4w9xUDqH-srF4yTEfJrRsw\">Integrate IoT devices</a> without layer upon layer of architecture or the inter-company political risk of a middleman.</p>\n\n<p>Everything mentioned above is available to you without having to buy anything more than the block space. I haven\u2019t even mentioned a coin or token above. This isn\u2019t a sales pitch for cryptocurrencies; you can use dollar equivalents at every level of your application if you choose and reap the benefits of this technology anyway.</p>\n\n<p>These are features that are <em>desirable</em> regardless of what any government does or does not like. Regardless of how you feel about it, it is already here, and it\u2019s not going away. If your company ignores this, your competitors will not. If your nation bans this, the productivity will just go overseas. There are tens of thousands active developers working on applications for the Ethereum Blockchain alone. Has any technology ever reached this degree of penetration and then quietly gone away? Does <a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*92XyUw_XOcWofleF2VtZUQ.png\">this chart</a> look bearish to you?</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re just approaching this space from the fringes what you have probably heard about is an endless stream of hacks and scams. It\u2019s true, there are multi-million dollar losses that occur on a seemingly weekly basis here. The finality guarantees mentioned above make fertile ground for attackers. It may surprise you then to hear that, culturally, this is the most optimistic group of people I have ever encountered. Despite the potential for misuse and the constant threat of attack, the opportunities so far outweigh the risks that people are positively brimming with excitement. Drop by a hackathon at a conference sometime, the energy is palpable.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes following this space feels like a frenzied land-grab in a new continent. We are thousands of ships exploring, surveying, and settling. There are riches aplenty for the taking but there are also dangers as with any uncharted territory. Tales of shipwrecks and piracy are common. Fear sells after all. The loudest tales though are of those who have struck gold or made a new village here. Every shipwreck just serves as a lesson to the next ships of the impending dangers. The bones of the ocean rising to greet new visitors. In the end though we are explorers and this is the frontier. We know the risks and we are here anyway.</p>\n\n<p>On a final parting note, there is a term we have for the peculiar mental-state people assume when they investigate this space in earnest. They get \u201cred-pilled\u201d. You\u2019ll commonly hear the phrase going down <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole\">The Rabbit Hole</a>. It\u2019s surprisingly apt. Things you will learn here will make the mundane seem strange. We regularly engage in conversation on everything from philosophy and <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame/\">morality</a>, to academic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault\">game theory</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-deep-dive-into-futarchy-what-national-governments-and-private-organisations-can-learn-from-a-9408aa2fb887\">coordination/governance mechanisms</a>, to <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/rate-speculation-platforms/\">financial primitives</a> and the <a href=\"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/ether-a-new-model-for-money\">nature of money</a>, to highly technical <a href=\"https://polynya.medium.com/\">software architecture design</a>. At some point on the journey you\u2019ll look at the world and what used to be normal will look insane and corrupt. It\u2019s a true looking-glass moment; you&#39;ll never be the same after it.</p>\n\n<p>Self-serving <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-tide-of-technology/\">link</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-01 23:49:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i700dl8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ugi0co","parent_id":"t3_ugi0co","score":93,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":">\tWe are already past the inflection point where it would be deeply unpopular to ban crypto.

She was often called \"the richest girl in the world\". Her great wealth, luxurious lifestyle, and love life attracted significant press coverage, both during her life and after her death.\n\nShe received large bequests from her father's will when she turned 21, 25, and 30; she was sometimes referred to as the \"world's richest girl.\" When Duke came of age, she used her wealth to pursue a variety of interests, including extensive world travel and the arts. She studied singing with Estelle Liebling, the voice teacher of Beverly Sills, in New York City. During World War II, she worked in a canteen for sailors in Egypt, taking a salary of one dollar a year. She spoke French fluently. In 1945, Duke began a short-lived career as a foreign correspondent for the International News Service, reporting from different cities across the war-ravaged Europe. After the war, she moved to Paris and wrote for the magazine Harper's Bazaar.\n\n\r  \nWhen Doris' father died, he left a fortune valued at $100 million, with the largest share going to Duke and her mother. Doris' mom was a shrewd businesswoman, and when she died in 1962, she left her daughter an estate then estimated to be worth $250 million.  \nDuke also owned numerous shares in big-name companies, such as General Motors, and had a large financial team of bankers and accountants to manage her holdings. In addition, Duke had a collection of artwork, which was said to include works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Monet, as well as her valuable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asia art and furniture. Also in Duke's collection were over 2,000 bottles of rare wine (worth over $5 million) and the extraordinary Duke collection of fine jewels. Her total net worth, including all property, was valued at $5.3 billion.\n\n\r  \nWhile living in Hawaii, Duke became the first non-Hawaiian woman to take up competitive surfing under the tutelage of surfing champion and Olympic swimmer Duke Kahanamoku and his brothers. A lover of animals, in particular her dogs and pet camels, in her later years Duke became a wildlife refuge supporter.\r  \n\r  \nConstruction of Shangri La took place from 1936 to 1938, after Doris Duke's 1935 honeymoon which took her through the Islamic world. For nearly 60 years, Duke commissioned and collected artworks for the space, eventually forming a collection of over 4,000 objects. The building was opened to the public as a museum, the Shangri La Museum for Islamic Art, Design & Culture, in 2002\n\nThe museum displays a wide-ranging collection of art, furnishings, and built-in architectural elements from Iran, Morocco, Turkey, Spain, Syria, Egypt, and India \u2014among others. Gilt and painted ceilings from Morocco, vivid ceramics from Iran (including the only complete lusterware Ilkhanid mihrab in North America), painted wooden interiors from Syria, pierced metalwork and vibrant textiles from Spain to India (including a magnificent pair of shaped carpets, made for the Mughal emperor) are among the many highlights. Its multiple buildings on the campus also include The Playhouse (a reduced-scale version of the 17th century Chehel Sotoun in Esfahan, Iran, now used for public programs and artist residencies).  \nThe outdoor landscaping has a number of gardens, including a formal Mughal garden inspired by the Shalimar Gardens, as well as terraced water features, a Hawaiian fishpond, tropical gardens and a waterfall, and fabulous vistas of the Pacific Ocean.  \nThe museum also hosts two visual artists per year for onsite exhibitions, workshops, and/or lectures.

If you are directly creating value that reverberates on all token holders and if the more capital you have access to, the more leverage you have to create value, perhaps arguably you should take as much of a share as the market will allow.</p>\n\n<p>ChainLink launched with a third of the supply for the team, a third of the supply for marketing/incentives (also in full control of the team), and a third ICOed; all of that years before having a product. Basically, you can get away with 100% of the supply to yourself if the narrative is right.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-02 07:34:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i7161m4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ugi0co","parent_id":"t1_i70yqyd","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/educatemybrain","body":"That's pretty common for web2 startups.

In other words, you are looking at the recent past to estimate the companies ability to generate money and put a price on that. You can do that with Ethereum just fine or you can build a more sophisticated DCF. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to see all this calculated in excruciating detail you can find it here:\n<a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rrfo14/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum\">https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rrfo14/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-02 01:00:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i705c5p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ugi0co","parent_id":"t1_i6zsvgi","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Very interesting, thanks!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Very interesting, thanks!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-02 08:13:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i71bjuz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ugi0co","parent_id":"t1_i705c5p","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/NefariousNaz","body":"You're right to question whether it actually makes sense.
