I think it covers some important rules about investing in general:\n\n>I'm not going to talk you out of going with your gut. Nobody knows in this market. However, what I will try to talk you out of is recklessly putting your whole stack into a trade. Just like I would never advise anyone to go 100% in an asset, I think it is equally reckless to go 100% out of an asset you truly believe in just because you think a giant global recession or crash is incoming. You're basically trading on a gut feeling. That almost never ends well. If you're feeling uncomfortable with your ETH position or other assets in light of what is going on then take some money out into cash or gold or whatever you prefer. Maybe sell half of your ETH. But for the love of god please don't trade your whole stack on a gut feeling. If you're wrong you will find it almost impossible to forgive yourself and get over the opportunity you missed out on.\n\n>Finally, do you know what the richest people in the world historically have done? They have bought when there is blood on the streets. I see blood everywhere on wall street right now. Could there be more to come? Sure? Is the economy looking dogshit? Yep. However, the covid crash happened very fast and then as the economy kept tanking stocks had already bottomed and started to recover. It could be similar again this time. The FED knows to avoid a deflationary doom loop at all costs, even if it means hyper inflation, hyper inflation is the lesser of two evils. Ultimately, ***those who buy right and sit tight with a long time preference for investing always come out on top.***\n\n>So to repeat it once more so I'm clear. Please, do not move your whole stack for a trade like this. Trading is not a good way of making money for most. Buy right and sit tight. If you're feeling uncomfortable then do what I have done. Take a small amount off the table (or more if your needs justify it) to cover any expenses for yourself in a future where the markets get uglier. Just be sure not to give up your once in a lifetime ticket because of an incredibly powerful emotion called fear.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I just wanted to share the following excerpt I wrote in response to another user further down thinking of capitulating due to fear of a wider market crash and overall an ugly economic and political situation worldwide. I think it covers some important rules about investing in general:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m not going to talk you out of going with your gut. Nobody knows in this market. However, what I will try to talk you out of is recklessly putting your whole stack into a trade. Just like I would never advise anyone to go 100% in an asset, I think it is equally reckless to go 100% out of an asset you truly believe in just because you think a giant global recession or crash is incoming. You&#39;re basically trading on a gut feeling. That almost never ends well. If you&#39;re feeling uncomfortable with your ETH position or other assets in light of what is going on then take some money out into cash or gold or whatever you prefer. Maybe sell half of your ETH. But for the love of god please don&#39;t trade your whole stack on a gut feeling. If you&#39;re wrong you will find it almost impossible to forgive yourself and get over the opportunity you missed out on.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, do you know what the richest people in the world historically have done? They have bought when there is blood on the streets. I see blood everywhere on wall street right now. Could there be more to come? Sure? Is the economy looking dogshit? Yep. However, the covid crash happened very fast and then as the economy kept tanking stocks had already bottomed and started to recover. It could be similar again this time. The FED knows to avoid a deflationary doom loop at all costs, even if it means hyper inflation, hyper inflation is the lesser of two evils. Ultimately, <strong><em>those who buy right and sit tight with a long time preference for investing always come out on top.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>So to repeat it once more so I&#39;m clear. Please, do not move your whole stack for a trade like this. Trading is not a good way of making money for most. Buy right and sit tight. If you&#39;re feeling uncomfortable then do what I have done.

It's been months and I haven't heard of anyone working on something like that. (In fact, the only use I heard of for the blessed BASEFEE opcode has been that one novelty NFT)\n\nI'm struggling to see how a gas futures concept would work, but the ultimate goal would be to smooth out volatility in the L1 gas prices somehow. Seems paradoxical on the surface, since any activity related to a gas future market would obviously be extra on-chain activity that necessarily contributes to a higher base fee. I'm thinking some kind of smart contracts where you can agree ahead of time to buy gas at a specific price between a specific block range. Then you either win or lose that bet, when you lose someone can redeem your contract to save on gas (so MEV bots would be all over it), but I have no clue how you could profit if you win the bet since the ETH always has to come from somewhere. So whatever design I come up with always ends up being overly complicated.

(In fact, the only use I heard of for the blessed BASEFEE opcode has been that one novelty NFT)</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m struggling to see how a gas futures concept would work, but the ultimate goal would be to smooth out volatility in the L1 gas prices somehow. Seems paradoxical on the surface, since any activity related to a gas future market would obviously be extra on-chain activity that necessarily contributes to a higher base fee. I&#39;m thinking some kind of smart contracts where you can agree ahead of time to buy gas at a specific price between a specific block range.
