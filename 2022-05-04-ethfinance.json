Higher ranking means higher preference of seeing them go.\n\n1) Liquity. AFAIK I haven't seen any innovation from them since their launch. The product is basically finished. The LUSD peg is enforced by arbitrage because you can actually redeem the collateral underlying loans. That immediately kills most of my interest in using it and there just isn't enough innovation here to be worth talking about.\n\n2) Index Coop. They make ETF's. That's basically it. Those ETF's happen to be performing horribly but even if they didn't is this dramatically different from holding a multi-token Balancer LP? The only exception is icETH which they didn't invest (Galleon did) and which kind of can't do horribly by definition. CMV.\n\n3) Compound. The only innovation I've seen from these guys in like 2 years is a suggestion to turn off liquidity mining? Last I heard on some Bankless episode they were going down the Cefi lending route too. Not exactly selling me guys. There's a reason they lost so much share to Aave. Where's the rETH and wstETH collateral? 1.5% stablecoin yield? gtfo\n\n4) Uniswap. Dead DAO. Huge volumes, plenty of potential revenue, but they can't even manage to turn a fee switch on. They have a massive treasury and are failing to use it. Their \"Defi education fund\" was also sketchy af.\n\n5) Opensea. Between the censorship problems, the lack of fee sharing with their customers, and just a general Defi attitude I'm constantly left rooting for LookRare even if I'm not an investor and NFT's totally aren't my space.\n\n6) ENS. They're a core piece of Defi infrastructure but ultimately I still don't see the value of the token. I personally sold that pretty close to the high. I mean, what more do you actually want from ENS than what they do? ENS registration on an L2? There just isn't much to talk about here.\n\n7) Tornado. Similar to ENS. It just feels like this product is finished except for deploying to an L2 and other chains to tumble their L1's as well. What's there to talk about?\n\n8) Abra. Ok, so you can use some crazy assets as collateral for Maker style loans. They've got some partnerships, some degenbox strategies, and more liquidity farming rewards than Maker which pays me to hold some MIM in my stablecoin portfolio. Very little of that has anything to do with the design of MIM itself and everything to do with their DAO's willingness and ability to engage in partnerships. Is that good enough to stay in the next round? Let's talk about it.\n\n9) Sushiswap. One of the first ever vampire attacks. Pretty cool lesson there. Followed by a bunch of other popcorn moments. A dev rug, a dev anti-rug, salvation! , crazy food farming fun for a few months, some lending stuff, and more recently some multi-chain stuff. As a DEX it isn't offering a solution to capital efficiency like Balancer, Bancor, and Uniswap are. It isn't offering safer yields like Bancor or Impermax are. Innovation appears to have stalled and I do remember a lot of drama in their leadership ranks a few months ago that might be telling as to why.\n\n10) Gnosis. So xDAI is interesting in that it uses a stablecoin as its gas asset. There was a merger here I never followed up on the motivation for. They've done some cool things for MEV protection such as cowswap which is pretty cool but it has its' own token. I honestly might not be giving this team enough credit. Maybe they just need a marketing boost. CMV.\n\n11) Yearn. Turn some assets into interesting bearing versions of themselves. Neat trick in 2020! Since they launched they got the iron bank system as one of the first undercollateralized loan systems in Defi. They got a v2 vault which can support multiple strategies. They got heavily engaged with and subsequently lost the Curve wars to Convex. They have multi-chain deployments on Arbitrum and Avax. They've also got some of the best in business dev-ops and [financial breakdowns](https://www.yfistats.com/financials/RevProjections.html). It's a very professional organization but I don't know what I'd write next week about them that's new. IMO they really need to get on with revamping the YFI tokenomics. Their BABY program just isn't getting it done. They have about $10M in YFI buyback per year on an asset with a $633M market cap. I'd want to see it at about $30M. Buybacks in general, while tax-efficient, don't allow you to incentivize specific ecosystem actors which is kind of a problem.\n\n12) Tribe - Fei/Rari. Well, there's more to talk about here at least. There was the merger of Rari and Fei. There was a reentrance hack last week. They have a more aggressive money market system that let's you basically opt into your own DAO with its own risk parameters. There was something they were doing where you could mint FEI into existence in some special way as long as it remained in an LP. I never got to the bottom of how that worked and if someone can give me a good explainer of it I might swap this out for Aave in my vote this week. Actually talk to me about the difference between FEI, FRAX, and RAI too.\n\nThe rest of these are still showing more recent innovation worth talking about so I'd like to see them talked about more in the coming weeks. As a first chop, just keeping interesting stuff rather than focusing on TVL or growth is a quick and easy filter.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Alright here&#39;s my take of the protocols I&#39;d vote off the protocol runoff poll based on who is doing interesting stuff right now and who I want to see more discussion on in the coming weeks vs who is not. Higher ranking means higher preference of seeing them go.</p>\n\n<p>1) Liquity. AFAIK I haven&#39;t seen any innovation from them since their launch. The product is basically finished. The LUSD peg is enforced by arbitrage because you can actually redeem the collateral underlying loans. That immediately kills most of my interest in using it and there just isn&#39;t enough innovation here to be worth talking about.</p>\n\n<p>2) Index Coop. They make ETF&#39;s. That&#39;s basically it. Those ETF&#39;s happen to be performing horribly but even if they didn&#39;t is this dramatically different from holding a multi-token Balancer LP? The only exception is icETH which they didn&#39;t invest (Galleon did) and which kind of can&#39;t do horribly by definition. CMV.</p>\n\n<p>3) Compound. The only innovation I&#39;ve seen from these guys in like 2 years is a suggestion to turn off liquidity mining? Last I heard on some Bankless episode they were going down the Cefi lending route too. Not exactly selling me guys. There&#39;s a reason they lost so much share to Aave. Where&#39;s the rETH and wstETH collateral? 1.5% stablecoin yield? gtfo</p>\n\n<p>4) Uniswap. Dead DAO. Huge volumes, plenty of potential revenue, but they can&#39;t even manage to turn a fee switch on. They have a massive treasury and are failing to use it. Their &quot;Defi education fund&quot; was also sketchy af.</p>\n\n<p>5) Opensea. Between the censorship problems, the lack of fee sharing with their customers, and just a general Defi attitude I&#39;m constantly left rooting for LookRare even if I&#39;m not an investor and NFT&#39;s totally aren&#39;t my space.</p>\n\n<p>6) ENS. They&#39;re a core piece of Defi infrastructure but ultimately I still don&#39;t see the value of the token. I personally sold that pretty close to the high. I mean, what more do you actually want from ENS than what they do? ENS registration on an L2? There just isn&#39;t much to talk about here.</p>\n\n<p>7) Tornado. Similar to ENS. It just feels like this product is finished except for deploying to an L2 and other chains to tumble their L1&#39;s as well. What&#39;s there to talk about?</p>\n\n<p>8) Abra. Ok, so you can use some crazy assets as collateral for Maker style loans. They&#39;ve got some partnerships, some degenbox strategies, and more liquidity farming rewards than Maker which pays me to hold some MIM in my stablecoin portfolio. Very little of that has anything to do with the design of MIM itself and everything to do with their DAO&#39;s willingness and ability to engage in partnerships. Is that good enough to stay in the next round? Let&#39;s talk about it.</p>\n\n<p>9) Sushiswap. One of the first ever vampire attacks. Pretty cool lesson there. Followed by a bunch of other popcorn moments. A dev rug, a dev anti-rug, salvation! , crazy food farming fun for a few months, some lending stuff, and more recently some multi-chain stuff. As a DEX it isn&#39;t offering a solution to capital efficiency like Balancer, Bancor, and Uniswap are. It isn&#39;t offering safer yields like Bancor or Impermax are. Innovation appears to have stalled and I do remember a lot of drama in their leadership ranks a few months ago that might be telling as to why.</p>\n\n<p>10) Gnosis. So xDAI is interesting in that it uses a stablecoin as its gas asset. There was a merger here I never followed up on the motivation for. They&#39;ve done some cool things for MEV protection such as cowswap which is pretty cool but it has its&#39; own token. I honestly might not be giving this team enough credit. Maybe they just need a marketing boost. CMV.</p>\n\n<p>11) Yearn. Turn some assets into interesting bearing versions of themselves. Neat trick in 2020!

They can help you try to spot Menehune and evidence of their nighttime antics:\n\nLegend has it that Polynesians arriving at the Hawaiian Islands in the 13th century (according to some estimates, possibly centuries earlier) were not the first people to inhabit the islands. The Polynesians, whose offspring would become Hawaiians, said there were already several races of people living there, including the diminutive Menehune. As the Polynesians established themselves, the Menehune retreated to the deep forests and hidden valleys of the Hawaiian Islands, hidden and far away from human settlements.\n\nThe Menehune, said to be about 2 feet tall (0.6 meter) are described as superb craftspeople. They built temples (heiau), fishponds, roads, canoes and houses. Some of these structures that Hawaiian folklore attributed to the Menehune still exist. Their favorite food is the mai\u02bba (banana), and they also like fish. Legend has it that the Menehune will only appear during night hours, in order to build masterpieces. But if they fail to complete their work in the length of the night, they will leave it unoccupied.

The Polynesians, whose offspring would become Hawaiians, said there were already several races of people living there, including the diminutive Menehune.

They built temples (heiau), fishponds, roads, canoes and houses. Some of these structures that Hawaiian folklore attributed to the Menehune still exist. Their favorite food is the mai\u02bba (banana), and they also like fish. Legend has it that the Menehune will only appear during night hours, in order to build masterpieces.

For that you\u2019ll probably want to learn popular front end languages and frameworks such as Javascript and React, or back end languages geared towards smart contracts such as Solidity or Rust.</p>\n\n<p>For the others types of jobs the best thing you can do is become a part of a community that interests you and make yourself known through positive contributions. Write articles that educate; give input and opinions to founders; contribute to important discussions; become a user. These are things that you can do that show interest and initiative, and give you a leg up when it comes to getting a job in Web 3.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-04 21:05:36","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-04 21:12:59","id":"i7dwjf6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uhz16g","parent_id":"t1_i7duw9t","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ModeratelyTortoise","body":"Just to tag on, I\u2019d definitely recommend going from JavaScript -> Solidity.\n\nYou\u2019ll find more demand in Web3 for Solidity, but they have very similar syntax and resources for JS are typically better and more widespread, as it\u2019s a much older, widely used language.\nIf you know JS, it will make learning Solidity much easier.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Just to tag on, I\u2019d definitely recommend going from JavaScript -&gt; Solidity.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll find more demand in Web3 for Solidity, but they have very similar syntax and resources for JS are typically better and more widespread, as it\u2019s a much older, widely used language.\nIf you know JS, it will make learning Solidity much easier.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-04 21:50:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i7e14xg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uhz16g","parent_id":"t1_i7dwjf6","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/BigglyBillBrasky","body":"Checkout PlannerDAO","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Checkout PlannerDAO</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-04 21:39:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i7e016t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uhz16g","parent_id":"t1_i7duw9t","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Papazio","body":"This is a pretty minor issue but the terms \u2018hackathon\u2019 and \u2018hack together\u2019 aren\u2019t very helpful when it comes to differentiating code exploits from hacks and social engineering attacks. \n\nIf \u2018hack\u2019 can mean a range of things when making stuff but needs to be specific when breaking stuff, it is not very conducive to nuance.\n\nEdit: the problem is not with hacking events, but with the use of the term when reporting on cyber attacks.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is a pretty minor issue but the terms \u2018hackathon\u2019 and \u2018hack together\u2019 aren\u2019t very helpful when it comes to differentiating code exploits from hacks and social engineering attacks. </p>\n\n<p>If \u2018hack\u2019 can mean a range of things when making stuff but needs to be specific when breaking stuff, it is not very conducive to nuance.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: the problem is not with hacking events, but with the use of the term when reporting on cyber attacks.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-04 06:13:49","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-04 07:09:05","id":"i7adwrm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uhz16g","parent_id":"t3_uhz16g","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/th3_Joker21","body":"The term 'hacker' actually refers to anyone who programs.
