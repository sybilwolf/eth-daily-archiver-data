It&#39;s why we need decentralization now - to prevent the need for a powerful controller to give up that power.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-06 07:20:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i7k2vq0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uipt94","parent_id":"t1_i7ip22p","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/chocolatemoosemoose","body":"I love the idea of getting liquid staking index.
