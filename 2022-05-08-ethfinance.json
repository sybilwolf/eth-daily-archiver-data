This matching round takes 350,000 DAI provided by the EF and collects signals (in the form of DAI on Aribtrum) from the community to give that DAI to the most deserving projects.\n\nI won't talk a lot about the projects, (you can read [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/uk5z3v/daily_general_discussion_may_7_2022/i7p6ep4/) for a broader explanation), but I DO want to share BrightID with everyone. Here are some bullet points:\n\n* Though anyone is welcome to join, this BrightID verification call has been set up just for EthFinance, so it could be a cool way for us to see a glimpse of each other and connect through a crypto-social network.\n\n* One goal of BrightID is to be a sybil resistance mechanism. Sybil attacks are when one person attempts to portray themself as many people online in order to gain an advantage. The advantage to be gained in a quadratic funding round is to steer more funds to one project by appearing to be many interested people.\n\n* BrightID is one of several Proof of Humanity projects that seeks to resist sybil attacks by identifying real, individual humans.\n\n* BrightID is NOT KYC, no personal information is collected during BrightID verification. You WILL be asked to show your face on the video screen during a zoom call to prove that you are a real human. Photos or previously recorded videos are not proof of liveness.\n\n* You will not be asked to share an Ethereum wallet address or any other cryptocurrency information when participating.\n\n* When you install the BrightID app on your phone, you will be asked to enter a name for your account. I use my screenname, Superphiz, not my real name. You can choose any name you want for yourself, but I do suggest that you use something personal to you, since that's how your friends will see your name displayed if they link with you in the future.\n\n* Before you join the call, you might choose to edit your zoom name to align with the name you use for BrightID. This improves the \"live person\" verification and can improve your privacy.\n\n* The call will begin with a brief introduction to BrightID by a staff member (I contacted them and they agreed to send someone, but there's obviously no guarantee), they will introduce the program for three minutes, then spend the rest of the call creating \"connections\", this is when you scan a QR code with your phone and import the list of other people in the room. At that time you'll have an opportunity to decide whether others in the room are real people or somehow trying to game the system. When enough people (with enough BrightID verification) approve you, you'll be verified as a unique human.\n\n* Completing the BrightID verification process is becoming more valuable in our ecosystem every day. In this case, it verifies your proof of individuality so you can participate in the funds matching round at qf.ethstaker.cc to maximize the positive impact of your signaling donation.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Today at 2pm Eastern time you can ]join a short zoom call (this has passed, I&#39;ve removed the link) to get verified on <a href=\"https://www.brightid.org/\">BrightID</a> as a step to participating as a donor in the quadratic funds matching round developed by the EF, clr.fund, and EthStaker.

I think one thing he said is *really* underappreciated atm. Right now protocols have to pay out LM rewards for Pool-2 depth so that their *other* issuance can be redeemed for value. This issuance contributes to the gradual decline of their token price. Recently Balancer decided that instead of voting with veBAL you'd vote with a BAL/ETH LP token. This forces governance entities to provide the liquidity and reduces the required issuance to attract Pool-2 liquidity. In this interview Mark is saying they will have a fungible bnLP token and protocols are adopting this token for their governance system in the same spirit as Balancer but without the IL risk to their users that a BAL/ETH token requires. So if you want to vote in Harvests governance system you'd hold bnFARM and earn trading fees on it while having IL insurance. If Harvest wants to reward these stakers with their protocol revenue they can provide that income to bnFARM holders with liquidity rewards themselves rather than having a separate staking FARM LM pool. It's integrated, it's *clean*, and it's a straight improvement on the state of the art. What does any DAO stand to lose by adopting this approach? All it does is improve their liquidity and reduce their required emissions.\n\nThis pattern would apply to *so* many other DAOs.

I think one thing he said is <em>really</em> underappreciated atm. Right now protocols have to pay out LM rewards for Pool-2 depth so that their <em>other</em> issuance can be redeemed for value. This issuance contributes to the gradual decline of their token price. Recently Balancer decided that instead of voting with veBAL you&#39;d vote with a BAL/ETH LP token. This forces governance entities to provide the liquidity and reduces the required issuance to attract Pool-2 liquidity. In this interview Mark is saying they will have a fungible bnLP token and protocols are adopting this token for their governance system in the same spirit as Balancer but without the IL risk to their users that a BAL/ETH token requires. So if you want to vote in Harvests governance system you&#39;d hold bnFARM and earn trading fees on it while having IL insurance. If Harvest wants to reward these stakers with their protocol revenue they can provide that income to bnFARM holders with liquidity rewards themselves rather than having a separate staking FARM LM pool. It&#39;s integrated, it&#39;s <em>clean</em>, and it&#39;s a straight improvement on the state of the art. What does any DAO stand to lose by adopting this approach?
