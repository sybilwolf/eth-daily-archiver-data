The real metric is the liquidity depth which is at most the unstaked portion of LUNA which is already only 58% of the market cap. How much of that 58% is in the LUNA/USDC pool within 20% of the current strike price? Likely less than 10%. So the real backing of UST in LUNA terms is probably less than $1B. This is backing $18B. The <em>other</em> backing is the unknown pockets of Jump capital. If they spend $10B and catch the price is the other $8B UST still going to sell?

Now I\u2019m not confident it\u2019ll have that big of an impact short term. Even if it does, if we\u2019re below $1,700, or worse at $1,000 or less, what\u2019s it going to pump to? Where we\u2019re at now? </p>\n\n<p>Not that that wouldn\u2019t be nice if we\u2019re that low, but everyone expecting a rocket to $10k will likely be very disappointed. Even if we somehow manage to crab between $2k and $2,500 between now and the merge, I think the rocket to 10k will be stuck refueling until 2025 assuming the cycle patterns hold.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-09 10:54:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i7y3j9y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uljnvf","parent_id":"t1_i7y1ui7","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Builder_Bob23","body":"> I remember all the development that was happening during the last bear and it didn\u2019t do shit for the price.\n\nAll of that development in theory set us up for the run to $4,800.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I remember all the development that was happening during the last bear and it didn\u2019t do shit for the price.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All of that development in theory set us up for the run to $4,800.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-09 11:06:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i7y5bv6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uljnvf","parent_id":"t1_i7y3j9y","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/mikron2","body":"Right, there\u2019s no denying that but it still took the BTC halving in May of \u201820 to kick off the run to get there.\n\nNot saying that development during a bear isn\u2019t worthwhile, just that it\u2019s effects aren\u2019t immediately felt like some are expecting.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Right, there\u2019s no denying that but it still took the BTC halving in May of \u201820 to kick off the run to get there.</p>\n\n<p>Not saying that development during a bear isn\u2019t worthwhile, just that it\u2019s effects aren\u2019t immediately felt like some are expecting.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-09 11:09:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i7y5s09","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uljnvf","parent_id":"t1_i7y5bv6","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/sorangutan","body":"> When was the last time actual development did something for eths price short term?\n\nblowoff top in Jan 2018 was fueled by a spec release of a PoW that got shelved","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>When was the last time actual development did something for eths price short term?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>blowoff top in Jan 2018 was fueled by a spec release of a PoW that got shelved</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-09 10:45:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i7y2be5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uljnvf","parent_id":"t1_i7y1ui7","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"It 100% was not because of a not even close to ready Casper that never even got out of design phase.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It 100% was not because of a not even close to ready Casper that never even got out of design phase.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-09 10:53:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i7y3etz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uljnvf","parent_id":"t1_i7y2be5","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"Idk, it was far enough along that they said as an absolute last resort against ASIC attacks Casper could be rolled out in a few weeks by forgoing the audit.

It boasts the world's largest maze, a Pineapple Express train tour and pineapples. If you don't want to trek that far, you can visit the former Dole cannery, which is now a shopping center, near Honolulu Harbor. Now, onto the story of Dole's founder:\n\nJames Drummond Dole (1877\u20131958), also known as the \"Pineapple King,\" industrialized pineapple production in Hawaii and came to dominate the market in less than 15 years. He established what would become the Dole Food Company that now operates in more than 90 countries. Dole was a cousin (once removed) of Sanford B. Dole, President of the Republic of Hawaii after the overthrow of the kingdom.\n\nDole moved to Oahu in 1899 at the age of 22 and bought a 64-acre (26-hectare) homestead and started experiment with crops, eventually landing on the pineapple. His farm grew, and Dole constructed a cannery and packing plant in the town of Wahiawa. Soon, yields and popularity of his product proved greater than he expected and Dole built a cannery and packing plant near Honolulu Harbor. That same year, 1907, Dole purchased magazine advertisements to promote his canned pineapples. He developed the first nationwide consumer ad campaign in the United States and was successful. Demand for Hawaiian pineapple grew even more.\n\nIn 1913, Dole invested in a new machine invented by Henry Gabriel Ginaca that could peel and core 35 pineapples every minute. Before the invention, Dole had to contend with the slow pace of having hundreds of workers peel and core each pineapple by hand. With a fully mechanized outfit, Dole's business boomed once more. \n\nBy 1922, Dole had managed to convince his family's network in Hawaii and in Boston to arrange for a sizable capital investment fund with which he purchased the island of Lanai and developed it as a vast pineapple plantation. It became the largest plantation in the world with over 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) devoted exclusively to growing pineapple. Utilizing large mechanized production and importing large numbers of foreign workers who were paid at indentured servitude levels, Dole managed to reduce the price of his pineapples to such a level that it drove every other producer out of the business which didn't fall into line with his scheme. With this vast pineapple cultivation at the company's disposal, throughout the 20th century, Lanai produced over seventy-five percent of the world's pineapple crop, thereby dominating the market, and in turn, the place acquired the nickname of Pineapple Island.\n\nDole retired in 1948. His company's pineapple production continued on Lanai until 1992, by which point it was more profitable to grow pineapples where they could pay people less. Larry Ellison of Oracle fame bought the former plantation \u2014 which is 98 percent of Lanai \u2014 for $300 million in 2012.\n\nBonus pineapple facts: \n\n* The fruit of a pineapple is usually arranged in two interlocking helices, often with 8 in one direction and 13 in the other, each being a Fibonacci number.\n* Pineapple plants grow to between 3 feet and 5 feet (1 meter and 1.5 meter)\n* The pineapple carries out crassulacean acid metabolism, where it \"breathes\" only at night to prevent water loss and stores it as malic acid to get through the day.\n* Pineapples used to be super expensive in Europe because they grew in tropical conditions and took two years to bear fruit. They were fashionable among nobles as exotic and difficult-to-procure party fare. Less well-to-do people could rent a pineapple for a centerpiece but had to return the fruit uneaten so it could be rented out again.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hawaii&#39;s second most-visited tourist attraction is Dole Plantation, about 25 miles northwest of <a href=\"https://hodlercon.com/\">Hodlercon</a>.
