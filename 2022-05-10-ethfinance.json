Things are going REALLY well, so far we have 659 contributions with seven funding recipients. We have several other funding recipients in various stages of approval - I think we've approved about ten and declined two of them. The applications that were denied have been things that have no evidence to show historical effort (i.e. an empty github), or are totally unrelated to staking. I made a point that I want NORMAL people to feel comfortable contributing to this, so if you have a project and even an empty github, you just need to be very clear and articulate about what you plan to do with the funds you raise.\n\nThere's a \"feature\" of clr.fund that took some getting used to for me: You can only make one deposit on checkout. So I sent 60 DAI for the current projects and planned to add more later, but that 60 DAI is now my total contribution. I can shuffle that around and give some to new projects as they onboard.\n\nSome people have grumbled about BrightID and many have onboarded. Say what you will, I think it's a great non-invasive social graph, but you'll need to judge that for yourself. I feel kind of confident that BrightID will continue to be a useful anti-sybil mechanism for a long time to come, so it's always good to be an early adopter. I promoted the BrightID verification parties before but now I know that you only need to connect with two existing members (in good standing) to get verified, so that means you can easily connect with people here to get that done.\n\nI'm aiming for 8000 contributions to the matching round, and we're at 659 now. I know that contributions tend to roll in late in the cycle, but I'd love your participation in submitting your contribution early talking about the program publicly.

Things are going REALLY well, so far we have 659 contributions with seven funding recipients. We have several other funding recipients in various stages of approval - I think we&#39;ve approved about ten and declined two of them. The applications that were denied have been things that have no evidence to show historical effort (i.e. an empty github), or are totally unrelated to staking. I made a point that I want NORMAL people to feel comfortable contributing to this, so if you have a project and even an empty github, you just need to be very clear and articulate about what you plan to do with the funds you raise.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a &quot;feature&quot; of clr.fund that took some getting used to for me: You can only make one deposit on checkout. So I sent 60 DAI for the current projects and planned to add more later, but that 60 DAI is now my total contribution. I can shuffle that around and give some to new projects as they onboard.</p>\n\n<p>Some people have grumbled about BrightID and many have onboarded.

Spinner dolphins take advantage of the nightly migration that brings their prey species to shallower depths and closer to shore by feeding throughout the night.\n\nDue to the spinner dolphin foraging and feeding at night, in certain regions, such as Hawaii and northern Brazil, dolphins spend the daytime resting in shallow bays near deep water. Spinner dolphins rest as a single unit, moving back and forth slowly in a tight formation but just out of contact with one another. These resting behaviors are observed for about four to five hours daily. During rest periods, spinner dolphins rely on vision rather than echolocation. At dusk, they travel offshore to feed.

Of the 18 bridges I can&#39;t find two of them: Dfyn and Varen. All 16 bridges can bridge USDC from mainnet to Arbitrum, 10 bridges can bridge USDC from Optimism to Arbitrum (which is probably my preferred method, although fees will dictate that in the end).   </p>\n\n<p>I am probably going to use all of them to get this <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/the-arbitrum-odyssey-87d6e11171d5#:%7E:text=Users%20that%20use%20the%203rd%2Dparty%20decentralized%20bridge%20that%20has%20the%20most%20addresses%20bridge%20in%20ETH/tokens%20(and%20does%20not%20bridge%20out!\">NFT</a>%20will%20also%20receive%20a%20bonus%20NFT!): &quot;Users that use the 3rd-party decentralized bridge that has the most addresses bridge in ETH/tokens (and does not bridge out!) will also receive a bonus NFT!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Using 5 or 10 of the most popular bridges will also get you this NFT, but I have some troubles judging the popularity of the bridges.
