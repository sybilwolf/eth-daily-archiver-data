This won't help anyone who just lost their shirt on Luna, or those outside of our sub, but here are the rough guidelines that were taught to me, and which we should continue passing on to future generations:\n\n- **Never invest more than you can afford to lose.**  If you're going to end up on the streets or in a debt-hole you can't climb your way out of, don't invest that money.  You should be absolutely, positively, 100% ok with watching your crypto investment go to ZERO.\n\n- **If you're having trouble sleeping at night because you're stressing about your portfolio, YOU ARE OVERINVESTED.**  Take some off the table -- even if it's at a loss -- until you can meet the requirements laid out above.\n\n- **Understand what you're investing in.**  You don't need to comprehend all the cryptographic math or code behind it, but you should understand the technical basics of how it works and what the engine driving it forward looks like.  At the very least, you should find some trusted people whose advice is solid and listen to what they're saying about any given project.\n\n- **Practice adversarial thinking.**  Ask yourself \"What's the worst-case scenario? How could this go wrong?  What are the pitfalls that could cause this whole project to fail?\"  You need to consider the downside as well as the upside.\n\n- **Don't rush into anything.**  Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is a powerful feeling, but I can guarantee you that other opportunities that are just as good will come along in the future.  FOMO is often weaponized by bad actors to get people invested without following the steps above and doing their due diligence. Yes, you might miss out on some gains this way, but over the long-term being patient will save you from more rugs than riches.\n\n- Finally, **Don't be afraid to ask questions.**  We were all new once and many people here have lost more than you realize.  There is a wealth of information available, but you'll never know if you don't tap into it.  Sure, you might get a little hazing for being new, but no one should ever be rude to you here.

These round, brightly colored, cardboard caps were in every kid\u2019s back pocket, ready to be thrown down at a moment\u2019s notice. The modern game itself originated in Hawaii, brought to full revival by local school teacher Blossom Galbiso at Waialua Elementary School.\n\nTo play Pogs, players make a stack of these caps, and take turns to drop a heavier \"slammer\" object onto it, causing the caps to be disrupted. Each player keeps any face-up caps and is to restack the face-down caps, repeating the process until none land face-down, at which point the player who collected the most caps wins the game.\r  \n\r  \nThe game is attributed to the classic Japanese game of Menko, a game played with paper cards and pieces. Players would attempt to flip their opponent\u2019s cards over. When Japanese immigrants settled in Hawaii in the early 1900s, children adapted the game pieces to round milk bottle caps and the evolution of Menko into Pogs began.\r  \n\r  \nIn the early 1990s, Galbiso, a teacher and counselor in Waialua, reintroduced the game to her students and used it as a tool to learn math. Galbiso and her students hunted for proper materials for their game and liked the classic milk bottle caps used by Haleakala Dairy on Maui. The tops were round, flat and made out of cardboard. About that same time, a fruit drink called POG was very popular in Hawaii, and the Dairy began distributing POG milk bottle caps to promote its fruit drink. POG is made from passion fruit, orange and guava juices. The game spread so rapidly around the islands, that the packing company for the milk bottle caps was asked if they could make extras.\n\nIts popularity didn\u2019t stay sequestered in Hawaii for very long. At PeakPog, roughly 1994 to 1995, every fast-food chain, cartoon series, sports team, and hair-metal band had its own set with limited-edition designs. Southern California entrepreneur Alan Rypinski (who had developed and sold the company behind Armor All) is credited with sparking this cottage industry on the mainland, once projected to be worth $500 million. When the Canadian printing company manufacturing Passion Orange Guava\u2019s packaging began receiving a sudden influx of requests for just the lids to send to Hawaii, Rypinski  purchased the POG trademark from Haleakala Dairy to start his own cash cow: a caps-only business catering to the new legions of Pog obsessives. In forming the the World POG Federation, an official Pogman mascot, and diverse licensing agreements with fast-food companies, movie studios, and Wal-Mart, Rypinski helped game spread to all corner of the U.S.\n\nBy 1994 alone, 350 million Pogs were sold nationwide. In the state of California alone, Pog sales generated $10 million a week. Haleakala Dairy, however, wasn\u2019t able to retain control of its messaging, a lost opportunity for what could have been one of the biggest coups in food-brand marketing history.\n\nGalbiso, the schoolteacher, died of a heart ailment at the height of the craze in 1994, at age 45.

It was my first choice last week and still my first choice this week. There's no innovation happening here and little to talk about. LUSD won't ever become unpegged because you can redeem the underlying collateral at any time and it's always overcollateralized. This is a shitty deal for LUSD minters, but provides rock solid peg stability for LUSD holders. There's really not much more so say here.\n\n2) ENS. Similar reasoning. It's there. It works. The tokenomics are non-existent and the price + ratio will continue to fall. What more do you actually want to talk about for ENS?\n\n3) Aave. So, unpopular opinion, but money market protocols aren't the most exciting thing. AAVE as a token has too much issuance, too little protocol revenue, and their stkAAVE insurance backstop is ineffective at providing practical insurance. The moment a hack actually occurs, the AAVE price would crater before you could so much as make a snapshot poll on what to do about it. So if they think they have $100M in insurance backstop, it's practically probably closer to $25M. They should swap to a stablecoin insurance backstop (maybe LUSD?) and tie the stkAave issuance to vote participation with bonded stablecoins on your vote.\n\n4) Balancer. So this is up against Bancor and Curve. Both Bancor and Curve are pushing the boundaries of AMM technology a bit more than Balancer. Balancer is doing two cool things I'll discuss here.\n\na) Instead of trying to get capital efficiency with compressed liquidity ranges like Univ3, they are getting it by deploying idle liquidity to money markets. So, if you have ETH/USDC on Balancer, only the ETH and USDC close to the strike price on the bonding curve is sitting there ready for immediate trading. The remaining liquidity can be parked in Aave where the ETH can be making 2-3% powered by the leveraged stETH/ETH trade. It's an entirely different solution than Uniswap and imo one that sets up LPs for less impermanent loss. It's worth noting Bancor is *also* doing this. You can argue Tokemak is basically a governance heavy version of this concept as well right?\n\nb) The other innovation is the use of BAL/ETH LP tokens for voting in their DAO. Basically they are trying to eliminate the liquidity farming expense of maintaining a BAL/ETH pool. So, if you want to vote in their protocol you'll need to cough up some ETH, pair it with your BAL stake, and solve this critical DAO need as a service. The con of this approach is that if your token goes up in value, your most active holders are actually selling their tokens. It's innovative but there's actually a much better solution that solves both problems: voting with bnBAL. The bn stands for Bancor Network. It doesn't require your investors to pair your governance token with ETH to replace your Pool-2. It's insured against IL unlike the the BAL/ETH LP token. It's...beautiful.\n\nThe other side of things is Balancer's multi-token pools. It's a neat trick with some interesting applications and they've done it flawlessly for years. However, now we have Curve v2 pools that do the same thing *and* have a dynamic bonding curve kind of like Kyber's DMM. I really don't think most people understand how innovative the Tricrypto Curve pool actually is. Everyone thinks Curve is just for like-kind pairs, but there's literally a BTC/ETH/USDT pool that's been on their AMM for awhile now which is very clearly not a like-kind pair. So basically, in the areas where Balancer has innovated, their competitors have innovated harder. I think a combination of Curve + Bancor can win the AMM wars over Uniswap in the long term. I'll give a nod to Tokemak here too as an IL insurance protocol but that's a longer story.\n\n5) Gnosis. Mostly known for their multi-sig contracts. These guys actually have a few other things going on like they bought the xDAI network. Being able to pay for gas with a stablecoin is neat. If you actually want an L1 stablecoin integration (ahem UST), this is a much better way to do it if only we could figure out a trustless bridge. Can someone make an xDAI L2 that pays for gas with DAI at some premium that they then swap to ETH to pay for L1 gas fees? What else is there to talk about? I'm not the most informed here.\n\n6) DefiSaver. I love these guys, you all know how often I plug them in my writeups, but I have to start making cuts somewhere. Sorry nikola_j.\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts on MakerDAOs RWA program, DAIs role in the ecosystem in the wake of the UST spectacle, how you would appraise TOKE given that it's market cap is already *way* below the liquidity in their reactors, LooksRare revenue models and how sustainable you think the NFT markets are + who is going to win between Coinbase NFT, OpenSea, and LooksRare, Alchemix's rapidly depleting transmuter reserves, the future of veTokens and whether the illiquidity they aspire to is actually a healthy thing, or how FEI actually works to keep the peg and how that compares to FRAX or what Alchemix is doing with their coming AMO. So yeah, no shortage of topics. Let's distract ourselves from the wall of red with some fundamentals discussion and why Defi is exciting.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So here&#39;s my preference for eliminations the next Manenet DAO Protocol Runoff Poll:</p>\n\n<p>1) Liquity.

It works. The tokenomics are non-existent and the price + ratio will continue to fall. What more do you actually want to talk about for ENS?</p>\n\n<p>3) Aave. So, unpopular opinion, but money market protocols aren&#39;t the most exciting thing. AAVE as a token has too much issuance, too little protocol revenue, and their stkAAVE insurance backstop is ineffective at providing practical insurance. The moment a hack actually occurs, the AAVE price would crater before you could so much as make a snapshot poll on what to do about it. So if they think they have $100M in insurance backstop, it&#39;s practically probably closer to $25M. They should swap to a stablecoin insurance backstop (maybe LUSD?) and tie the stkAave issuance to vote participation with bonded stablecoins on your vote.</p>\n\n<p>4) Balancer. So this is up against Bancor and Curve. Both Bancor and Curve are pushing the boundaries of AMM technology a bit more than Balancer. Balancer is doing two cool things I&#39;ll discuss here.</p>\n\n<p>a) Instead of trying to get capital efficiency with compressed liquidity ranges like Univ3, they are getting it by deploying idle liquidity to money markets. So, if you have ETH/USDC on Balancer, only the ETH and USDC close to the strike price on the bonding curve is sitting there ready for immediate trading. The remaining liquidity can be parked in Aave where the ETH can be making 2-3% powered by the leveraged stETH/ETH trade. It&#39;s an entirely different solution than Uniswap and imo one that sets up LPs for less impermanent loss. It&#39;s worth noting Bancor is <em>also</em> doing this. You can argue Tokemak is basically a governance heavy version of this concept as well right?</p>\n\n<p>b) The other innovation is the use of BAL/ETH LP tokens for voting in their DAO. Basically they are trying to eliminate the liquidity farming expense of maintaining a BAL/ETH pool. So, if you want to vote in their protocol you&#39;ll need to cough up some ETH, pair it with your BAL stake, and solve this critical DAO need as a service. The con of this approach is that if your token goes up in value, your most active holders are actually selling their tokens. It&#39;s innovative but there&#39;s actually a much better solution that solves both problems: voting with bnBAL. The bn stands for Bancor Network. It doesn&#39;t require your investors to pair your governance token with ETH to replace your Pool-2. It&#39;s insured against IL unlike the the BAL/ETH LP token. It&#39;s...beautiful.</p>\n\n<p>The other side of things is Balancer&#39;s multi-token pools. It&#39;s a neat trick with some interesting applications and they&#39;ve done it flawlessly for years. However, now we have Curve v2 pools that do the same thing <em>and</em> have a dynamic bonding curve kind of like Kyber&#39;s DMM. I really don&#39;t think most people understand how innovative the Tricrypto Curve pool actually is. Everyone thinks Curve is just for like-kind pairs, but there&#39;s literally a BTC/ETH/USDT pool that&#39;s been on their AMM for awhile now which is very clearly not a like-kind pair. So basically, in the areas where Balancer has innovated, their competitors have innovated harder. I think a combination of Curve + Bancor can win the AMM wars over Uniswap in the long term. I&#39;ll give a nod to Tokemak here too as an IL insurance protocol but that&#39;s a longer story.</p>\n\n<p>5) Gnosis. Mostly known for their multi-sig contracts. These guys actually have a few other things going on like they bought the xDAI network. Being able to pay for gas with a stablecoin is neat. If you actually want an L1 stablecoin integration (ahem UST), this is a much better way to do it if only we could figure out a trustless bridge. Can someone make an xDAI L2 that pays for gas with DAI at some premium that they then swap to ETH to pay for L1 gas fees? What else is there to talk about? I&#39;m not the most informed here.</p>\n\n<p>6) DefiSaver. I love these guys, you all know how often I plug them in my writeups, but I have to start making cuts somewhere. Sorry nikola_j.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on MakerDAOs RWA program, DAIs role in the ecosystem in the wake of the UST spectacle, how you would appraise TOKE given that it&#39;s market cap is already <em>way</em> below the liquidity in their reactors, LooksRare revenue models and how sustainable you think the NFT markets are + who is going to win between Coinbase NFT, OpenSea, and LooksRare, Alchemix&#39;s rapidly depleting transmuter reserves, the future of veTokens and whether the illiquidity they aspire to is actually a healthy thing, or how FEI actually works to keep the peg and how that compares to FRAX or what Alchemix is doing with their coming AMO. So yeah, no shortage of topics. Let&#39;s distract ourselves from the wall of red with some fundamentals discussion and why Defi is exciting.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-11 13:28:31","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-11 13:37:05","id":"i88bpvp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_un1xdr","parent_id":"t3_un1xdr","score":25,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/newtosh","body":">\tHowever, now we have Curve v2 pools that do the same thing and have a dynamic bonding curve kind of like Kyber\u2019s DMM. \n\nMay I ask what a dynamic bonding curve is?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>However, now we have Curve v2 pools that do the same thing and have a dynamic bonding curve kind of like Kyber\u2019s DMM. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>May I ask what a dynamic bonding curve is?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-11 14:24:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i88k6z2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_un1xdr","parent_id":"t1_i88bpvp","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"You increase the trading fee and relax the amount of liquidity required to move the strike price as volume picks up.

On the other hand if enough people play along with the conspiracy for fun then more people will start to believe it.\n\nWe have seen this play out in many nonsnse claims and can see it at different stages with different conspiracy beliefs today.\n\nIdeas start off with most people sharing them as jokes, like the 'birds aren't real' stuff; if these ideas are funny they get spread around communities like 4chan and then dispersed wider in a more trolly way. The 'flat Earth' movement is an example of a conspiracy that 10 years ago was mostly a joke but now has true believers, including a guy who killed himself in a home made rocket trying to fly high enough to see for himself. If an idea is given enough legitimacy and has a motivated community who want it to be true then it can get to frightening levels of belief, exemplified by the q-anon cultists who have convinced each other that people they disagree with politically are in fact paedo-vampires...\n\nIn the case of UST/Luna, the risk I see is that if the people who lost money fall into the narrative that there was an external attack, rather than just the collapse of a house of cards that people had warned them about, then they won't learn from it. Terra won't be held to account and the believers will be vulnerable to fall for the same kind of nonsense again.\n\nLoosing money from mistakes in crypto can be a really valuable learning experience.

The &#39;flat Earth&#39; movement is an example of a conspiracy that 10 years ago was mostly a joke but now has true believers, including a guy who killed himself in a home made rocket trying to fly high enough to see for himself. If an idea is given enough legitimacy and has a motivated community who want it to be true then it can get to frightening levels of belief, exemplified by the q-anon cultists who have convinced each other that people they disagree with politically are in fact paedo-vampires...</p>\n\n<p>In the case of UST/Luna, the risk I see is that if the people who lost money fall into the narrative that there was an external attack, rather than just the collapse of a house of cards that people had warned them about, then they won&#39;t learn from it. Terra won&#39;t be held to account and the believers will be vulnerable to fall for the same kind of nonsense again.</p>\n\n<p>Loosing money from mistakes in crypto can be a really valuable learning experience.

my previous comments on this.\n\nOne of the most common errors in human thinking is imagining agency in complex, chaotic data.\n\nOur instincts jump on any observation that could be indicative of a mind taking action against us, regardless of the probability that this is the case.\n\nThis is why we assumed thunder and lightning must be caused by some intelligent gods. It's why kids get scared of noises in the dark. It's the reason conspiracy theories from the Illuminati, to vaccine's causing autism, to Q-anon, are so readily adopted by so many.\n\nIt's why in a system as complex and chaotic as the crypto markets, if things start to go wrong it feels reasonable to attribute this to the intentional machinations of a group of powerful individuals.\n\nThe reason for this instinct is simple to understand. There's an evolutionary advantage to assuming every rustling in the bushes is a predator. If you're wrong the cost of fleeing is minimal and doesn't impact your ability to pass on your genes, if you're right it saves you from being eaten. On the other hand, if you assume the rustling is just the wind (which it probably is 90% of the time) then if you are wrong even once it can potentially end your chances at passing on your genes (because you're dead). Therefore in the next generation there are more descendants of those who imagined agency where none existed.\n\nRepeat that for a few million years and here we are today, imagining conspiracies to explain the fact that an unsustainable house of cards has collapsed.\n\nFor sure, these kinds of ideas add drama and excitement to the narrative. On the other hand if enough people play along with the conspiracy for fun then more people will start to believe it.\n\nWe have seen this play out in many nonsnse claims and can see it at different stages with different conspiracy beliefs today.\n\nIdeas start off with most people sharing them as jokes, like the 'birds aren't real' stuff; if these ideas are funny they get spread around communities like 4chan and then dispersed wider in a more trolly way. The 'flat Earth' movement is an example of a conspiracy that 10 years ago was mostly a joke but now has true believers, including a guy who killed himself in a home made rocket trying to fly high enough to see for himself. If an idea is given enough legitimacy and has a motivated community who want it to be true then it can get to frightening levels of belief, exemplified by the q-anon cultists who have convinced each other that people they disagree with politically are in fact paedo-vampires...\n\nIn the case of UST/Luna, the risk I see is that if the people who lost money fall into the narrative that there was an external attack, rather than just the collapse of a house of cards that people had warned them about, then they won't learn from it. Terra won't be held to account and the believers will be vulnerable to fall for the same kind of nonsense again.\n\nLoosing money from mistakes in crypto can be a really valuable learning experience. You can see it as an expensive education, meaning you're stronger as an investor in the future. By creating a false narrative with a shadowy enemy people are robbed of even the chance to gain knowledge from their experience.\n\n\nTL:DR - Go and re-read The Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Reposting my previous comments on this.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most common errors in human thinking is imagining agency in complex, chaotic data.</p>\n\n<p>Our instincts jump on any observation that could be indicative of a mind taking action against us, regardless of the probability that this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>This is why we assumed thunder and lightning must be caused by some intelligent gods.
