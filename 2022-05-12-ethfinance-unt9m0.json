If you weren\u2019t around for the last real bear market, it was a good 2 years of constant pain. Does that mean it has to last that long this time, definitely not, but I wouldn\u2019t rule it out either. During that time any good news and fundamentals did little to nothing for the price. In a bull market buying the dip makes sense, but during a bear market the dip keeps on dipping. I\u2019m not saying not to buy, but I am saying you may want to shift your mindset. We\u2019re all here because we believe in ETH and think it\u2019s a life changing investment. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to, or should blow your all dry power after a large drop like this one. Timing the bottom is extremely difficult. There were many times in the last bear that I thought the bottom was in only to see it fall further. And as much as I hate to say it, the quantity of people in here suggesting that we have to be close to a bottom probably means we\u2019re not actually there yet. The merge is a bullish catalyst yes, but macro is bearish until proven otherwise, and the reality is that price action in this space is still largely driven by narrative and speculation. Hopefully that begins to change post merge.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo what should you do in times like this? Keep an open mind, expect hard times, plan accordingly, come up with a strategy and stick to it. Personally I find DCA to be a reliable approach to accumulating without risking too much all at once. Others will wait for a trend reversal and then start to DCA in. What you don\u2019t want to do in times like this is get excited and bet more than you can afford to lose because it has fallen so far so fast, and it looks so appealing compared to prices a week ago. Anything you put in these market conditions should be funds you don\u2019t need for the foreseeable future. If you need help planning, feel free to ask others in here what they did. There are plenty of veterans in here that made a killing by stacking during the bear last time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for keeping your mental health in check, lean on fundamentals, learnings, and discussions in here as validation that you\u2019re investing for the right reasons. Invest with conviction or don\u2019t invest at all. If you\u2019re feeling down about price, step away and don\u2019t check for a while. Bear markets are a great time to learn, build, and network with people that are going to be around regardless of what the market conditions are. I distinctly remember RSA and David posting links to their first ever Bankless podcast in here and asking for feedback. DCInvestor spent his time learning and diving into early-stage projects with large upside. Superphiz used to be a regular poster like anyone else before becoming the staking guru he is now. There are plenty of examples of people that stuck it out and made efforts to better themselves during the bear market, and saw large dividends for it later. If becoming more involved in crypto isn\u2019t your thing, then invest passively and pick up a new hobby or skill; or maybe devote more time to spending time with those you care about. Time is a valuable resource and you may find that you have more of it when you\u2019re not obsessing over number go up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll in all, we may be in for some rough times ahead, but there\u2019s no better place to weather the storm than /r/ethfinance.

BTC hitting below its last low didn't trigger a cascading sell off, and so far they painted a lower low, while ours is still a higher low. So if this was the actual bottom and we manage to go up from here, this will mean great things for ETH during the bull. Because not only has ETH appreciated better than BTC during the pump, but it also held up better during the dump as well. Make no mistake, that will make a whole lot of BTC whales take notice and start allocating a bigger portion of their portfolio to ETH since the risk of losing more money with ETH during bear periods is no longer a threat.\n\nSo the bottom has to be around here somewhere because the # of coins changing hands during this dump has been insane...things may drop lower, but with the volume we are seeing right now there is a major expiration clock for this dump.\n\nNow you know during bear market I tend to do my analysis of BTC, because it tends to drag the market down during these periods regardless of what ETH does.\n\nAnd the volume profile for BTC is very promising. Not only short term, but also long term. \n\nOn Binance, on BTCUSD, during this dump, BTC had $31.3 billion in volume from the breakdown to today.\n\nBy comparison, the end of the world COVID dump for BTC traded $6.9 billion dollars in volume from the breakdown all the way to the bottom.\n\nSo that's 4.5x more volume compared to the covid dump which then triggered a 18x run for BTC and a 57x run for ETH($86->$4868). In other words, after this much volume changing hands, the upcoming bull run is going to be absolutely epic\n\nNow you are probably going to say...I'm still scared, the stock market is going to crash and it won't matter. But thats a good thing. Remember that the stock market has been going through the same exact thing as us. And a lot of these tech stocks are doing even worse than us. For example, Paypal had an 78% drop in a year. Crypto might be used to such big drops, so we can mentally handle them better, but the stock market isn't, which means they are way overdue for a massive move up of their own at the first sign of things improving....similar to what they've done after their covid drop. And if you remember the post covid pump in the stock market, its going to be absolutely epic. And we already know the catalyst for it...all it would take is for inflation to start receding and the market will take that as a green flag to go up massively. And a stock market rallying, means crypto is going to go absolutely bonkers. \n\nThe old log chart is still intact, so BTC should hit $300-400K during a proper run, and there is a REAL chance its going to hit a million bucks if we get the sort of prolonged stock rally I'm expecting. \n\nNow thats just BTC...ETH situation is going to be even better:\n\n1. we have the merge thats the equivalent of multiple halvings, the 6 month of no new ETH entering the market and even after that the # of ETH being allowed to unstake is limited. Now we should be seeing the merge within 6 months, so it should be dropping when we are firmly in the safety of a bull market and parabolic moves will be taken as granted.\n2. we've consolidated on the ratio for 4.5 years. By the time we hit ATH on the ratio, it would have been 5 years of consolidation before a break out. Now if you follow crypto at all, you know the longer you consolidate, the more epic the run gets. A year of consolidation, and some alts rally 5x-10x on the ratio. Can you venture one guess what breaking 5 years of consolidation will do for the ETHBTC ratio?  Its simple...the ratio is going to go absolutely vertical once it breaks out after so much time....why? because hitting the ATH on the ratio isn't just a technical trade...it would also mean ETH has taken the #1 spot away from BTC and is finally allowed to do price discovery on its own terms. And after 5 years of consolidation...there'll be a LOOOOOOOT of BTC holders that will want to switch over for the breakout trade. So my prediction of 2-3 BTC per ETH isn't as far fetched as many of you might think. Especially since ETH at number one, means there is no more ceiling any more, the narrative changes to ETH can do X, Y, Z that BTC can't...thus it should be worth X more than BTC. \n\nBecause of all that, I expect ETH to hit $50-150K during a normal run(for example if we match our covid pump, and do another 57x from $1800 that puts us at $102,600)...and remember we had 57x without the merge, without the triple halvning, without 1559, and without the parabolic momentum of breaking out on the ratio, and without the transition of BTCers into ETHers. So we should have a lot more momentum this time and should out perform that 57x. In other words, if things get truly crazy on the ratio, and we hit the 2-3BTC per ETH range I expect, a million dollar ETH is very much possible. The same way moon in the 2017 cycle was $100...and then after we broke out on the ratio ,we went exceeded all expectations and hit $1,400 \n\nSo keep your chin up, keep buying for your long term stack and accumulating because its only a matter of time before the stock market recovers and everything starts going up massively.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>haven&#39;t posted much guys because i&#39;ve been spreading my hopium in the EVM discord...but figured I was due to give you an update considering the last 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways to sum up the current situation</p>\n\n<p>Its going to be ok.

So in a scenario where that achieves sufficient lindy and scaling over time, the question might be, what is the optimal algorithm that allows for the lowest LTV or percentage of hard collateral while still being safe? </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done enough experimentation to know the answer to that, and for that reason I still lean towards lax or zero regulation on it for the time being. I do think 0% hard collateral backing shouldn\u2019t be allowed, but once you set that as a limit it becomes a debate and opens the door to more aggressive guard rails in the future. The unfortunate side effect of regulatory uncertainty is that investors have to assume the responsibility of becoming informed and exercising proper risk management. Unfortunately many will not, and there will be more losses for people</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-12 17:55:55","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-12 18:02:53","id":"i8e5gjd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_unt9m0","parent_id":"t1_i8e0im9","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Even if you have a hard collateral like actual gold to back your synthetic gold tokens there is still the question of what the fractional percent can be.
