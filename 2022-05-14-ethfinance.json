It's best if you don't give the same amount to every project, but instead, give more dai to projects you believe are most valuable for the ecosystem.

You can send DAI on Arbitrum directly to the matching pool. This is simple and doesn't require ANY verification. Anyone in the world can add to the matching pool, without the need for BrightID.

The 15% node operator fee rate isn&#39;t nearly high enough to overcome the farming opportunities in Defi. Someone running a node in Rocketpool might make 5% after the merge and we reach some staking equilibrium. In the meantime, someone piggybacking on their efforts by using the rETH pool in Defi might end up making 8%. For example see my <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/tgul2p/daily_general_discussion_-_march_18_2022/i152i74?context=3\">Logris Vault</a> idea for a way to make double rETH&#39;s yield using Alchemix.</p>\n\n<p>I can criticize staking in Lido. I can criticize staking in Dex&#39;s. I don&#39;t personally have an interest in running a node at home and buying my into an IT job. But Rocketpool is objectively good for the network and rETH is probably getting too good of a deal as it stands.</p>\n\n<p>Execution risk is about the only thing I can think of here.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-14 21:15:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i8nqhsu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_up9x14","parent_id":"t1_i8mx4fa","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/monkeyhold99","body":"They were late and lost first mover advantage.

Every day the oDAO oracle looks up how much ETH every node operator has on the beacon chain and feeds that in the smart contracts to update the ratio. In normal conditions (and even in a majority of non-normal conditions) the ratio always increases. \n\nSo like in a simplified world where RP just launched and the ratio starts at 1 ETH = 1 rETH we can follow along:\n\n* You deposit 16 ETH, get 16 rETH\n\n* Ratio guaranteed by RP is 16 / 16 = 1.00 ETH for every rETH\n\n* A node operator is handed those 16 ETH and matched with his own 16 ETH to start a minipool and stake them on behalf of the pool\n\n* A year later, he made a clean 5% yield\n\n* Total of 16.8 ETH in the system belongs to the pool, but there's still a total supply of 16 rETH circulating. Total ratio is 16.8 / 16 = 1.05 ETH for every rETH\n\n* Someone deposits 21 ETH in the pool and mints 20 rETH. Total ETH is 16.8 + 21 = 37.8 ETH for a total supply of 36 rETH. 37.8 / 36 = ratio is unaffected, still at 1.05\n\n* You use that dude's deposit as your exit liquidity from the pool, you burn 5 rETH and get 5.25 ETH in return (realizing 0.25 ETH of staking profits). Total ETH is now 37.8 - 5.25 = 32.55 for a total supply of 31 rETH. Ratio is 32.55 / 31 = still unaffected at 1.05\n\n* The deposit pool now contains 16.55 ETH waiting to be matched, completely idle and earning 0% APR. The one minipool operator is still only earning yield on those first 16 ETH (the 0.8 ETH rewards he got over the past year is not accumulating any yield since beacon chain doesn't compound)\n\n* Another year goes by and he made another 5% so the total ETH in the system increases by another 0.8 ETH, there's now a total of 32.55 + 0.8 = 33.35 ETH that belongs to the pool, for a circulating supply still at 31 rETH. 33.35 / 31 = ratio of 1.0758 ETH per rETH.\n\n* So the ETH sitting in the pool has effectively diluted the yield from every rETH from the beacon chain's promised 5% down to 1.0758/1.05 = ~2.45% for that second year. Or more simply the rETH you've been diamond-handing since day 1 have appreciated in value by 7.58% over those 2 years instead of the expected 10% you would have gotten if that second dude didn't deposit ETH that never got matched with a new node operator.\n\nLol the numbers were meant to be clean and simple at first but got progressively messy but hopefully it's still easy to follow.\n\nBut yeah, every rETH is fungible so you're at the mercy of yield dilution getting socialized across all rETH. There's a maximum of 2000 ETH in the deposit pool after which the contract will refuse to mint more rETH, in order to put a cap on this yield dilution in cases where people want rETH in large quantities and there's not enough new node operators to put all that new ETH to work. And there's more yield dilution to consider when the ETH does get matched but still takes 2-3 weeks to start earning staking rewards because of the clogged up beacon chain deposit queue.\n\nAnd as we've seen, burning/minting rETH doesn't affect the ratio since it affects both the numerator and denominator proportionally. So there's no get rich quick buy low sell high play to be had with the official contract itself, you always gotta wait to realize profits on your rETH's yield. (Sometimes the price will be higher or lower on Uniswap, which opens the door for some arbitrage)\n\nOn the other hand if (post-merge) our lucky node operator happens to win 100 ETH in tips at the start of an NFT drop, 50 ETH goes to the pool which also gets proportionally handed to rETH holders by affecting the ratio. 83.35 ETH / 31 rETH = ratio instantly jumps 2.68 rETH per ETH lol. (In reality with ~85k rETH, a lucky 100 ETH tip works out to an increase of barely 0.0012 on the ratio). \n\nWhat's cool is that these tips rewards will be immediately liquid and thrown back into the deposit pool, so that's 50 ETH that can be paired up with more node operators and that's effectively yield on 50 ETH that no one ever deposited (so no corresponding rETH got minted), increasing the numerator but not the denominator. So basically auto-componding the yield and we'll keep to see the ratio climb up faster and faster of course, rETH holders don't have to do anything special, just keep holding that bad boy. It'll be an awesome to track how significant this compounding effect turns out to be.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The formula is dead simple: Total ETH / Total rETH = how much ETH the official rocketpool contract is willing to trade for 1 rETH</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Total ETH&quot; is composed of the staked ETH + accrued staking rewards + ETH waiting in the deposit pool.
