It is understood well in advance yet has an impact every time\n* The merge is the most powerful structural flow catalyst to ever occur in the crypto space\n* Because this is very hard to price in, we can expect it to have a dramatic impact\n\n**Why ETH is valuable**\n\nCrypto assets are difficult to value because they are unlike any other asset. They fill a hybrid role.\n\nCrypto assets derive value from three different sources:\n\n* As a currency\n* As a store of value\n* As equities\n\nWhen the market is in a very frothy stage the actual value accrual mechanisms are less significant. When you get into a more mature market the true value that you can derive from the token starts to matter a lot more.\n\n**ETH vs Alt-L1's**\n\nEthereum:\n\n* only services the high end of the market\n* has extremely high net income margins\n* generates extremely sticky revenue\n\nAlt L1's:\n\n* only services the low end of the market\n* has negative net income margins and no path to positive net income margins\n* proven to be a very disruptable revenue base over time\n\nIn this context it makes sense to describe a higher multiple to the high margin sticky business. Yet, today, eth trades at a lower multiple than the alt-l1\u2019s.\n\n**Developer community**\n\nThe ETH developer community puts forth a strong focus on sustainability and is doing things the better way for the right reasons.\n\n**Revenue and costs**\n\nRevenue:\n\n* Transaction fees\n\nCosts:\n\n* For proof-of-work assets the issuance is an expense\n* For proof-of-stake assets the issuance is not an expense\n* For proof-of-stake assets the issuance becomes revenue because not everybody stakes. It is an expense for those who do not stake. It is a revenue for those who do stake\n* Other expenses for L1\u2019s are quite low: Paying developers (R&D expense). Any ecosystem fund or incentives\n\n**Supply and Demand**\n\n* Supply and demand is the price that you see when you look at any asset\n* It is just the price at which buyers and sellers are at equilibrium\n* The only thing that actually impacts price is supply and demand\n* Fundamentals can only impact price through their ability to affect supply and demand\n* Structural supply and demand forces are extremely important\n* Proof-of-stake assets in general have much more favourable supply and demand dynamics\n\n**The Merge**\n\n* The crypto space is dominated by BTC and ETH\n* The rest of the market tends to follow their behaviour\n* Both assets are proof-of-work\n* The space at large, and the macro crypto cycles, are governed by these proof-of-work supply and demand dynamics\n\nEvery day miners get a fixed number of tokens for mining the network. The issuance they receive is denominated in tokens, and not fiat currency. This means that ETH miners get 15,000 ETH tokens every day. \n\nIf you assume miners sell two-thirds of their tokens (possibly higher over time), that means that 10,000 tokens get sold every day. If ETH was $100, then you have nearly $1 million dollars of market selling every day that needs to be absorbed. $1 million dollars is not that much to be absorbed. However, if ETH goes to $5,000 then you have $50 million dollars every single day that needs to be absorbed. That\u2019s $1.5 billion dollars a month that needs to be absorbed. That\u2019s extremely hard to sustain. \n\nThat issuance linearly correlates with the price of the asset. This creates a very reflexive price action where when the asset goes up in value it pushes naturally the price back down because it creates more sell pressure. The reason for that is because the supply is denominated in tokens but the demand is denominated in fiat. Buying power does not expand when the price of the asset expands, so demand is relatively constant over longer periods of time, while supply increases with the price.\n\nThis is the actual most important fundamental driver as to why you see crypto cycles the way that you do.\n\nYou'll have a period of parabolic interest, fomo and excitement around these rallies, resulting in a parabolic rise. All the new money entering the space is enough to offset that increased miner sell pressure for a period, but inevitably it can\u2019t offset it forever. By the nature of the fact that you reset the price higher, you start to push it back down.\n\nUltimately you can never sustain any parabolic rise in crypto history because you create so much sell pressure by actually producing the parabolic rise.\n\n* The merge fixes this problem. There will be no more miner issuance dictating the entire market\n* This will create the lifting of the ceiling that has capped the price of the asset for so long\n* Instead of needing new money flowing into the network to sustain price every day you will instead need new money leaving the token every day to keep the price from rising every day\n* This will be paired with a very dramatic fundamental increase in value that will probably also stimulate discretionary demand\n* And also a massive increase in the staking rate which will also fuel discretionary demand\n* When the merge occurs we\u2019ll have this structural seller that has filled every Ethereum buyer for the last seven years disappear at one moment in time, paired with increased discretionary demand\n* The link between fundamentals and price is strengthened post-merge because revenue does flow into buy-pressure. Fundamentals start to directly correlate with flows and matter more for price\n* ETH dominance will rise post-merge and will likely flip BTC\n\n**Hal's Report**\n\nHal recently put out his report: [Ethereum, a generational investment.](https://medium.com/@halp1120/1-the-only-other-large-assets-that-arguably-have-structural-demand-are-luna-and-bnb-cdcf8b2a8281)\n\nI would reccomend giving it a read as it fleshes out many of the concepts he discussed in the interview.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m sure many of us watched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ARp6GRzJ3A\">Hal Press interview</a> on Bankless recently.</p>\n\n<p>For those that did not, I&#39;ve summarised Hal&#39;s outlook for you:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The crypto space trades on supply and demand</li>\n<li>The price is determined by an equilibrium between buyers and sellers</li>\n<li>The most important factor is structural supply and demand factors</li>\n<li>We can see this with the bitcoin halving event every four years.

Brand new internet money for hackers, that the government couldn't just shut down like the prior centralized attempts (and you know they would have, if they could). Watching the brand new, cutting edge of what would become this generation's largest social experiment, barely off the ground. Everyone was congregating on the Bitcoin Talk forums to talk about it. I was there making new buddies less than 2 years after Satoshi made his final post there in December 2010. People making all sorts of forks back then - all you had to do was change the issuance schedule and maybe the block time, and you had a new currency that other forum users would start mining. The only altcoins that survived from that era with any notable value left are dogecoin and arguably litecoin. I remember like, IX coin, IO coin, fucking Bitbar, Worldcoin, Peercoin or \"PPCoin\" with their god-awful shitty-ass website, which I always pronounced as \"pee pee coin\" which is probably why they changed the name, Namecoin which let you register and resolve names on it like ENS which was WAY ahead of its time, it really was a different era. You'd download a fork of Bitcoin-Qt, sync the altchain, use some no-name exchange to swap a little bitcoin for the altcoin, and you were off to the races.\n\nThen the Bitcoin subreddit came along with [this fucking ad](https://i.imgur.com/582E0LI.jpg) which will always be burned into my brain in the bestest of ways.\n\nNowadays I don't even use crypto to buy stuff anymore, I just hodl it for investment and speculation. Hopefully there will be another renaissance in the next five years or so, where I can freely spend USDC through an Ethereum L2 on physical goods, paying pennies in transaction fees just like in the old days, and making the store clerk call over their manager to figure out how to get the POS to accept a native digital payment, like a clerk trying to figure out how to accept apple pay seven years ago. And then a few years later, it will be mainstream.\n\nI wish I could feel the brand-newness again of first understanding the bitcoin whitepaper, there was no feeling like it. The feeling of holding onto a secret that the rest of humanity didn't yet know, but that you had a sneaking suspicion they would discover over the next decade. Honestly, the Ethereum merge comes close.\n\nI remember in 2012 being *so jealous* of the people who mined back in 2010, sucking up fat 50 BTC block rewards multiple times per day, while my GPU took days to mine even a single Bitcoin. I wanted to have, like, a thousand bitcoins. There were other people on Bitcoin Talk with a thousand bitcoins and I was jealous. They ran polls sometimes of how many bitcoins everyone had. Of course, at Bitcoin's recent peak, a thousand bitcoins is $60 Million. If I had only known, I would have YOLO'd my then-meager entire life savings into it and today I'd be buying kickass houses for my extended family. The first time I saw a Bitcoin price chart, way before I ever considered buying any, Bitcoin was at $6. If I had only fucking known! Though that's not to say I'm not happy with the way my life is turning out - it's so rich in so many other ways! The difference in happiness between comfortable middle class and fuck you rich really isn't that wide. At least I wasn't that one guy who threw out a hard drive with ten thousand bitcoins on it, and wasted the rest of his life scouring the landfill.\n\nRefreshing Mt. Gox over and over as the website got slower and slower from its shitty php code during big pumps and dumps. Watching people get double-rekt by bitfinex, first getting rekt from their derivatives behaving as designed, then getting rekt again by from their derivatives behaving not as designed. Butterfly labs and their \"two weeks\" meme about how they kept delaying shipping their asic mining hardware. ASICminer shares. The chinese \"Discus Fish\" mining pool taking over, then later it was cex.io with almost 50% of Bitcoin hash power. The whole Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin ABC stuff, and Brian Armstrong of Coinbase getting canceled for his views on it.\n\nFiddling with some random instructions from Bitcoin Talk, trying to use a clever time-lock transaction to move your Bitcoin SV without it triggering a replay transaction on the main Bitcoin chain. Watching Roger Ver and Craig Wright get painted as heroes and villains by conflicting ideological groups.\n\nBack then, it used to be really fun to make a bitcoin transaction. \"Wow! Look! Look it got a confirmation! Look, you can see it on blockchain.info! It's part of the chain's history now! Remember, wait 1 confirmation for low-value transactions, 3 confirmations for mid-value transactions, and 6 confirmations for high-value transactions! Remember, not your keys, not your coins!\" Also, managing your \"cold wallet\" private key using a pain in the ass offline-signing scheme on an old laptop, since hardware wallets didn't exist yet.\n\nAnybody else feel this way?

I'm so excited that you're joining us! I'd be glad to try to catch up on voice in about three hours if you want to dm me. Here are my thoughts:\n\n1. Bad security CAN lead to loss of funds if your deposit seed phrase is exposed. I know you know this, but I need to say it for everyone else. You're correct that if your staking box has never seen your seed phrase then your potential for loss is limited to slashing or exit, and to be honest that's unlikely as it probably won't benefit the attacker.\n\n2. Only run your keys on one machine, but you know this too.\n\n3. We're entering the merge phase so you'll want to update your client regularly. If you're using systemd processes from Somer's guides, write a script that basically contains those commands to make upgrading easier and reduce your offline time. One \"gotcha\" about upgrading system processes is that you must restart them to actually update the running binary.\n\n4. Don't panic. Really. If you somehow break everything or accidentally flush your node down the toilet in a drunken haze, it's no big deal, buy some parts and take a week to rebuild.\n\n5. If you ever feel like you're in over your head just relax, there are lots of different ways to solo stake and you can easily try another one. Being down is okay. You can leak for something like ten years before you'll be ejected.\n\n6. Beaconcha.in isn't going to give you a lot of info until you go live. If you're in the deposit queue you're fine, just wait anxiously until your two week wait in the queue is up. You can be offline during that time so it's a great time to write & test your update scripts.\n\n7. Even if you're the worlds worst validator and you feel like you can't ever get it right, you can still exit your validator any time you choose and withdraw the funds after Shanghai. I know this won't be the case, but I want to emphasize that you're never trapped.\n\n8. Make sure you set up notifications in beaconcha.in by creating an account (this isn't a product endorsement, but I'd definitely vouch for beaconcha.in), they also provide client update notices if you use the mobile app.\n\n9. You'll need to run both an execution client AND a consensus client locally, if you followed Soner's guide recently you're already doing this.\n\n10. You're going to need to set a fee recipient for EL rewards before the merge if you haven't already. I haven't set mine yet, but we still have a few months.\n\n11. SSD space is the most common issue people face on a daily basis. It's an annoyance that can be solved easily with bigger SSDs or pruning. If this gets annoying you can also put your EL and CL on different drives. This will likely be resolved by state trimming & statelessness in the near future.\n\nThat's about it. Once you start validating you can stare at those rewards trickling in, but you'll eventually forget the machine is even there... Just don't forget to update regularly.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wooo!! I&#39;m so excited that you&#39;re joining us!

These projects focus on setting up a Node (Stereum), portfolio tracking (rotki), visualizing beaconchain data for the average end user (Beaconcha.in), creating a dashboard to monitor the health of Ethereum's decentralization (Project Sunshine) and more. All projects help improve the Ethereum staking ecosystem by showing data, providing guides and promoting decentralization.\r  \n\r  \nIf you want to contribute you would have to verify that you are a unique human by going through the BrightID verification process: https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/verify This is to prevent Sybil attacks.\r  \nYou can verify by having two verified humans (could be your friends or me) verify that you are a real person.

These projects focus on setting up a Node (Stereum), portfolio tracking (rotki), visualizing beaconchain data for the average end user (Beaconcha.in), creating a dashboard to monitor the health of Ethereum&#39;s decentralization (Project Sunshine) and more. All projects help improve the Ethereum staking ecosystem by showing data, providing guides and promoting decentralization.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to contribute you would have to verify that you are a unique human by going through the BrightID verification process: <a href=\"https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/verify\">https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/verify</a> This is to prevent Sybil attacks.</p>\n\n<p>You can verify by having two verified humans (could be your friends or me) verify that you are a real person. The second option is verifying via a Zoom meeting. You only need to show your face and talk to someone for a quick minute in a Zoom meeting. You don&#39;t need to dox your name, address or any other personal data.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to contribute, there&#39;s more information + a guide here: <a href=\"https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/about/how-it-works\">https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/about/how-it-works</a></p>\n\n<p>You can see the different projects here: <a href=\"https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/projects\">https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/projects</a></p>\n\n<p>Quadratic funding explained by Finematics: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEHv-dE4xl8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEHv-dE4xl8</a></p>\n\n<p>If you want to learn more or ask questions join us in the Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/PBwdbtkn\">https://discord.gg/PBwdbtkn</a>  </p>\n\n<p>You can also add <a href=\"/u/-lightfoot\">u/-lightfoot</a>&#39;s smart and fast way to contribute if you are short on time (sometimes called lazy or time constrained):   </p>\n\n<p>If like me you don\u2019t want to do brightid for whatever reason but want to contribute to the ethstaker projects, you can add dai to the matching pool by clicking on app and then going to the round info. On pc thats on the left, on mobile/metamask app I think the below link works. This is on arbitrum.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/round-information\">https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/round-information</a></p>\n\n<p>Fwiw I\u2019m mostly not using brightid because I\u2019m lazy/time constrained and haven\u2019t bothered to really understand what it is. I guess that might cost me an airdrop some time down the line but this time around I\u2019m a lot more interested in simply supporting these important projects.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-16 06:36:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i8tgfz0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uqo3kx","parent_id":"t1_i8t5evb","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"\ud83d\udc46 Do what this man says. \ud83d\udc46","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\ud83d\udc46 Do what this man says. \ud83d\udc46</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-16 05:28:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i8t8mlc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uqo3kx","parent_id":"t1_i8t5evb","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Or else! \ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\ude21","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Or else! \ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\ude21</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-16 05:47:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i8tamnl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uqo3kx","parent_id":"t1_i8t8mlc","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Been heads down on a bunch of stuff but just wanted to let everybody know that another solo staked, double minority client, validator was [just born](https://imgur.com/a/xQyP45w) yesterday!

There are clearly lots of sketchy projects, but if you believe in decentralization of money like they do, then defi takes that way further than just sending digital cash between users.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp4U5aH%5C_T6A\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp4U5aH\\_T6A</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-16 09:22:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i8u3vt8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uqo3kx","parent_id":"t1_i8u2mzo","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheHighFlyer","body":"I go even further and say that I agree with the vast majority of his takes, same as Robert Breedlove.

When Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani came to power, she promulgated a new constitution which would have strengthened the monarchy relative to the legislature in which Euro-American business elites held disproportionate power. \n\nOn January 16, the Marshal of the Kingdom Charles B. Wilson was tipped off to the imminent coup. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13-member Committee of Safety, and put the Kingdom under martial law. Because the members had strong political ties with United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, the requests were repeatedly denied. After failed negotiations, Wilson rallied a force of 496 men to protect the queen.\n\nAs these events were unfolding, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu. Stevens, advised about these supposed threats, summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the USS Boston and two companies of U.S. sailors to land on the Kingdom and take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16. 162 sailors and Marines aboard the USS Boston in Honolulu Harbor came ashore well-armed but under orders of neutrality. The sailors and Marines did not enter the Palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served to intimidate royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, \"the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.\"  \nOn January 17, 1893, when John Good, a revolutionist, shot Leialoha, a native policeman who was trying to stop a wagon carrying weapons to the Committee of Safety led by Lorrin Thurston. The Committee of Safety feared the shooting would bring government forces to rout out the conspirators and stop the overthrow before it could begin. The Committee of Safety initiated the overthrow by organizing armed non-native men, under their leadership, intending to depose Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani. The forces garrisoned Ali'iolani Hale across the street from \u02bbIolani Palace and waited for the Queen's response.\n\nDue to the Queen's desire \"to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life\" for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. The anti-monarchist Honolulu Rifles took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a Provisional Government.\r  \n\r  \nOn January 17, 1893, the Chairman of the Committee of Safety, Henry E. Cooper, addressed a crowd assembled in front of \u02bbIolani Palace (the official royal residence) and read aloud a proclamation that formally deposed Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani, abolished the Hawaiian monarchy, and established a Provisional Government of Hawaii under President Sanford B. Dole.\n\nNewly inaugurated U.S. President Grover Cleveland called for an investigation into the overthrow. The investigation concluded that the \"United States diplomatic and military representatives had abused their authority and were responsible for the change in government.\" Minister Stevens was recalled, and the military commander of forces in Hawai\u02bbi was forced to resign his commission. President Cleveland stated, \"Substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character as well as the rights of the injured people requires we should endeavor to repair the monarchy.\"\n\nThe next U.S. president, William McKinley, in 1898 signed the Newlands Resolution annexing Hawaii. The formal ceremony which marked the annexation of Hawaii to the United States was held at the Iolani Palace on August 12, 1898. Almost no Native Hawaiians attended the annexation ceremony, and those few Hawaiians who were on the streets wore royalist ilima blossoms in their hats or hair.
