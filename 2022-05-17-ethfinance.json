By now I know dozens of people who own crypto or have dabbled in it. But how many *truly get it*? By that I mean, how many could join this subreddit as a mid-tier contributor without being out of their depth or not knowing any of the alpha here already? My answer out of maybe 20-30 people I know in crypto is just one, maybe two if you're generous. And this is excluding those who simply don't get crypto at all.\n\nSo let's analyse these two people and clarify what I mean by people who \"get it\". The first and probably only person I know who truly understands the alpha we understand here is my best friend. I ETHpilled him right away and he went right down a very similar rabbit hole to me. This almost doesn't count since a huge amount of what he knows is from me and the resources I pointed him to. He has moved into his own niche in that while I'm more of an EthFinance user who's more conservative with my crypto portfolio (almost all ETH, not taking too many risks) he is more risk tolerant and likes to speculate on NFTs a lot more than me and prefers Twitter and Discord over Reddit. Person #2 gets crypto and has been in it longer than me. However, he doesn't have any allegences to any coins. He just buys it all and doesn't spend too much time looking for the alpha, preferring to just buy everything and ride the macro crypto wave. Whenever I tell him about some Ethereum news it is evident to me that he really doesn't know too much about how much of a leader ETH is technologically. So while he definitely gets crypto as an OG Bitcoiner and shitcoin maxi, he couldn't separate the real innovation in this space from the VC chains and copycats (he does know what's a scam and what isn't though).\n\nSo what about the other folks I know who are in crypto? Well the vast majority have no idea what they're doing (think the most stereotypical retail investor) or are simply buying because they want to at least have some skin in the game and they kind of invest without really following crypto. For many of these people I have even tried pointing them in the right direction but in many cases they ended up making the same rookie mistakes despite my warnings.\n\nSo what is my point here? ***I'm saying we're still early.*** Sure, gone are they days of someone being interested and asking about \"that Bitcoin thing\" I'm so enthralled by, but do not conflate this with a lack of alpha. Sure, everyone may know what crypto is these days, but 99% of people still don't know where the real innovation is happening. They don't know where the value lies and they don't know that Ethereum is by far the most likely candidate to be the Amazon of our generation in financial terms (definitely not in ethical terms lmao, we are much better than that).\n\nA $2,000 ETH really is criminally undervalued in my opinion. We've just discovered [the big picture solution](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/skb5h6/how_ethereum_scales_eli12/) to the blockchain scalability trilemma and now we just have to build it. A modular Ethereum with rollups and danksharding is able to scale and remain decentralised while its monolithic competitors still seem to think that $20,000 super charged validator nodes is the answer, despite the many downtime issues and centralisation issues they have been facing lately. But almost nobody knows this. The masses see Bitcoin, the environment destroying leader of our industry falling towards its 2017 high and tens of billions of dollars disappearing in an instant as Terra \u2014 a system which Maker's head of risk declared foolishly risky back in 2018 \u2014 collapsed exactly as many of us predicted. They think crypto is dying.

The post COVID reopening / stimulus boom wasn't a \"real\" bull market. What's the likelihood that this crash is a \"real\" bear market? \n\nIf I put my foot on someone's neck until they pass out, then take it off and hang them upside down by their feet, and then take them down and let them recover, do they as a person intrinsically have \"dangerously low blood supply to their brain\", \"really high blood supply to their brain\", or do they have a normal blood supply to their brain and outside circumstances changed those measurements in a way that is so far outside normal experience that using that figure as a diagnostic measurement is meaningless?\n\nCOVID is still happening and there are major manufacturing cities in China that are in lockdown. Supply chains have never truly recovered since March 2020, and with these recent lockdowns in China that situation isn't going to improve.\n\nRussia stupidly invading Ukraine has caused new unprecedented turmoil in financial, energy, materials, and food markets as stronger and stronger sanctions have been applied.\n\nTerra / Luna imploded because someone(s) with deep pockets pulled a financial attack that targeted that network's weak point - it wasn't because the Ponzi crumbled due to not being viable when normal market swings shifted to bear. So, a big part of this new crypto crisis has basically zero to do with economic cycles.\n\nNothing for the last 2 years has been normal, nothing about any of these crises is a part of the normal cycle of expansion and contraction. People reading the tea leaves by looking at past recessions, and historical crypto price data during those recessions, seem like they might be missing the forest for the trees. It feels like we are experiencing yet another hyperspeed cycle that is an echo of the original COVID crash and stimulus, only with some bonus party favors thrown in for fun. \n\nNow that there hasn't been stimulus in a while and the Fed has tightened, plus Russia, plus the new crisis thanks to Terra, there is deleveraging of overhang that built up during the reopening and stimulus phase...but the important thing here is that this is *still not* a normal economic cycle. Everything fell off fast, came back on too fast, and now is falling off again fast. Expecting things to keep falling because in previous real bear markets prices dropped 90% just seems like a silly assumption.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that it can\u2019t go lower, or *a lot lower* if there\u2019s some insane new crisis, I\u2019m just saying that anyone saying that it *has* to go lower *because* in previous bear market cycles that\u2019s what it did might not exactly be reading the room. \n\nAnd before anyone says, \"isn't that just another way of saying this 'time is different'?\" I think that where that sentiment causes problems is when people say that about things that happen within the normal functioning of a market. When the difference has to do with fundamental structural aspects outside the market, then it might be worth actually considering if this time is different. \n\nLike if a decent sized meteor hits the planet and causes a nuclear winter that destroys food production for a decade, if someone says \"oh this economic downturn and reduced output will only last a year or so because all bear markets tend to turn around fairly quickly\" they'd be wrong because they are looking at past performance *within* normal market functionality when in fact the entire structure and capacity to support a market has changed.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think that trying to use historical gauges for what is happening in the economy that are from times of normal business just doesn&#39;t really have much meaning right now.
