Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, Jos\u00e9 do Esp\u00edrito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers. Two weeks after they disembarked from the SS Ravenscrag in late August 1879, the Hawaiian Gazette reported that \"Madeira Islanders recently arrived here, have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts.\" One of the most important factors in establishing the ukulele in Hawaiian music and culture was the ardent support and promotion of the instrument by King Kal\u0101kaua. A patron of the arts, he incorporated it into performances at royal gatherings.\n\nCommon types of ukuleles include soprano (standard ukulele), concert, tenor, and baritone. Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or \"pocket uke\"), bass, and contrabass ukuleles. Other types of ukuleles include banjo ukuleles and electric ukuleles. Of the standard ukuleles, the soprano, often called \"standard\" in Hawaii, is the second-smallest and was the original size. \n\nThe ukulele is generally made of wood, though variants have been composed partially or entirely of plastic or other materials. Cheaper ukuleles are generally made from plywood or laminated woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a tonewood such as spruce. More expensive ukuleles are made of solid hardwoods such as mahogany. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is a type of acacia endemic to Hawaii, called koa.\n\nThese instruments usually have four strings; some strings may be paired in courses, giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings (primarily for greater strumming volume.) The strings themselves were originally made of catgut (that is, stretched animal intestines similar to sausage casings). Modern ukuleles use nylon polymer strings, with many variations in the material, such as fluorocarbon, aluminum (as winding on lower-pitched strings), wound metal strings (similar to wound nylon strings, but with a metal core) and Nylgut.\n\nOne of the most common tunings for the standard or soprano ukulele is C6 tuning: G4\u2013C4\u2013E4\u2013A4, which is often remembered by the notes in the \"My dog has fleas\" jingle. Another common tuning for the soprano ukulele is the higher string-tension D6 tuning (or simply D tuning), A4\u2013D4\u2013F\u266f4\u2013B4, one step higher than the G4\u2013C4\u2013E4\u2013A4 tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s. D6 tuning is said by some to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D6 tuning with a low fourth string, A3\u2013D4\u2013F\u266f4\u2013B4, is sometimes called \"Canadian tuning\" after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor ukuleles.\n\nThe ukulele was popularized for a stateside audience during the Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition, held from spring to autumn of 1915 in San Francisco. The Hawaiian Pavilion featured a guitar and ukulele ensemble, George E. K. Awai and his Royal Hawaiian Quartet,along with ukulele maker and player Jonah Kumalae. The popularity of the ensemble with visitors launched a fad for Hawaiian-themed songs among Tin Pan Alley songwriters. The ensemble also introduced both the lap steel guitar and the ukulele into U.S. mainland popular music, where it was taken up by vaudeville performers.\r  \n\r  \nThe ukulele soon became an icon of the Jazz Age. Like guitar, basic ukulele skills can be learned fairly easily, and this highly portable, relatively inexpensive instrument was popular with amateur players throughout the 1920s. In the 1960s, educator J. Chalmers Doane dramatically changed school music programs across Canada, using the ukulele as an inexpensive and practical teaching instrument to foster musical literacy in the classroom. 50,000 schoolchildren and adults learned ukulele through the Doane program at its peak. \"Ukulele in the Classroom,\" a revised program created by James Hill and Doane in 2008 is a staple of music education in Canada.\n\nI'll save a post on more contemporary ukulele music for another day.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>By request from <a href=\"https://hodlercon.com/\">Holdercon</a>-goer <a href=\"/u/Tricky_Troll\">u/Tricky_Troll</a>, some background on the Hawaiian ukulele:</p>\n\n<p>The ukulele evolved in Hawaii from small guitarlike instruments from Portugal.

They are doing stupid shit like making K3vinh3art.eth and tagging @kevinhart to try to make him buy it. It makes the space look scammy and just downright stupid. They keep saying &quot;ENS summer is right around the corner bro, 3 digit ENS are going to 100E floor!!! Trust me bro, buy now!!!&quot; (And linking their opeansea) </p></li>\n<li><p>People are registering stupid as shit like Telsamotorvehiclecompany.eth thinking it has value because &quot;Tesla&quot; is in the name, once again, Tesla is not going to see that and say &quot;OMG I must buy this!!!!&quot;</p></li>\n<li><p>Budweiser bought beer.eth, not budweiser.eth...nuff said</p></li>\n<li><p>When I register names I register them for 5 years and up, try to make it more enticing for the buyer, I plan on doing 10 year extensions when I can catch cheap gas times. But I think they should raise the price to stop stupid ass registrations.</p></li>\n<li><p>Going back to the community, I believe registering names like Amaz0n and Mircosoft (I actually saw that one today, almost had me) is scammy and makes the space a mess, I agree. Another scam going around is for digits ls instead of 1s so like 9ll, you won&#39;t believe how many people get scammed from that. </p></li>\n<li><p>That being said, I bought a few (I think) great potential names, I won&#39;t reveal them yet, waiting on buying one more before setting up my own marketplace. I think ENS does have a future (especially with Coinbase integrating it), but I will make it a point to be fair with my values, as well you won&#39;t find any brand names or scams in my opensea, just clean, and practical names.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-18 13:23:19","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-18 13:28:32","id":"i948o6s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_us57z8","parent_id":"t1_i946mq6","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"It's feels and looks scammy because, like domain squatting, it is.\n\nEDIT: Remember \"work from home, make 2K a day!!?!\" that is all now MLMs and Drop Shipping?
