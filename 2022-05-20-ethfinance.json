[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/un1xdr/daily_general_discussion_may_11_2022/i88bpvp/?context=3) were my picks from last week. Sad to see some of my favorites go. There's now few enough protocols I'll be talking about each rather than just shit-talking the ones I want to go.\n\n**1) Aave**. Not much to say here I didn't say last week already.\n\n> AAVE as a token has too much issuance, too little protocol revenue, and their stkAAVE insurance backstop is ineffective at providing practical insurance. The moment a hack actually occurs, the AAVE price would crater before you could so much as make a snapshot poll on what to do about it. So if they think they have $100M in insurance backstop, it's practically probably closer to $25M. They should swap to a stablecoin insurance backstop (maybe LUSD?) and tie the stkAave issuance to vote participation with bonded stablecoins on your vote.\n\nI'm not seeing much innovation here lately other than deploying to multiple chains. The coolest thing they did recently was add wstETH as collateral. I'd like to see some rETH collateral but as I understand it rETH doesn't meet the liquidity depth they want yet. They should add other ibTokens as collateral to create more yield rate spread plays and get a fairer rate to base tokens such as USDC and DAI in the same way icETH/ETHMAXY have done for ETH.\n\n**2) Balancer**. Once again this is up against Bancor and Curve and imo it's being out-innovated by both. Both Balancer and Bancor are trying to get capital efficiency by investing idle capital in Defi rather than compressed liquidity ranges. The point of this is to improve yields without increasing IL. If that's the goal though, Bancor clearly wins on that mark. The other contender on the IL insurance was Tokemak. Y'all voted out Tokemak last week by a wide margin though. I didn't realize it was so unpopular. I'd like to hear your thoughts on that.\n\n**3) DefiSaver**. Wouldn't have made the cut for me last week so naturally they're on my chopping block again. Frankly I think these guys just need more devs. Their recipe books are awesome. They have a transaction simulator similar to what EY just put out too. Underappreciated work all around and I plug them whenever I reasonably can.\n\n**4) MakerDAO**. Despite recent... *demonstrations* on the difficulty of maintaining the peg of synthetic dollars Maker has still seen rapidly sliding adoption. DAI market cap is down from $10B to $6.5B at a time where there has been a flood of capital to stablecoins. Their RWA program is incurring *massive* costs but haven't yet really hit any exponential adoption. They've turned off the MKR burn entirely in favor of just growing the surplus buffer. After DAO expenses, their PE is now at 100 which is about 5x overpriced. Even if the MKR token was at $300 though I still wouldn't be buying it until they turn around their negative adoption trajectory.\n\nAt minimum here are my suggestions to them:\n\na) Change the PSM to shave 1% on minting/redeeming any DAI. There's way too much DAI that the DAO is responsible for maintaining the peg of but isn't getting any revenue from.\n\nb) Add an AMO like Frax and Alchemix that arbitrages peg deviations. If DAI is over the peg, the protocol can mint it, sell it for USDC or another stablecoin, and deposit the result into the PSM. This keeps the arbitrage profit in house. Right now, external arbitrageurs are making money on peg deivations. That's potential revenue that is just *bleeding* out from their ecosystem that could be captured by the DAO.\n\nc) Add default Dex buyers to their auction system. If no one bids, the system shouldn't sell your ETH for 0, it should sell it to Uniswap or another Dex by default.\n\nd) Launch an rETH vault. It's ok if you keep the debt ceiling on it low, people want to see this.\n\ne) Put together some proper education materials on your RWA program. Make some grants for it. People would be more excited for this if they did a better job on educating about it.\n\n**5) Curve**. Honestly I think Curve v2 pools are unappreciated. Everyone thinks of Curve as being a Dex for like-kind assets but the Tri-crypto pool has been on Curve for a good long time now and it's amazing. Like Kyber's DMM it adjusts it's bonding curve and fee structure in response to recent slippage. This basically takes profit away from arbitrageurs and reduces IL in times of price instability.\n\nEverything else going on with Curve is great too. Their weekly newsletter is the busiest of any protocol I know of. Over 100% of their CRV emissions are getting locked up in Convex alone. Their DAO is one of the most engaged anywhere. Curve basically handles the fat head of Defi liquidity between ETH/BTC/USD and it's associated synthetic assets.\n\n**6) Bancor**. Bancor is just coming online with their v3 platform. It's much more gas efficient, it auto-compounds LM rewards, it doesn't have the liquidity caps of v2, it allows partner DAOs to inject LM rewards into their pools without having to create a separate farming system, and it returns an LP token which makes for Defi composability.\n\nThe place where Bancor really shines is on the long tail of governance tokens. Curve gets you between BTC, ETH, and some synthetic USD very well. Bancor gets you from ETH/DAI to FARM, UMA, etc. The long tail of governance tokens tends to suffer higher IL and therefore requires higher APRs to attract liquidity. These rates and the subsequent dumping of liquidity farming tokens has absolutely destroyed the price of many of these tokens in the bear so far. For example, Alchemix is down over 98% from the ATH *already*. Just holding ALCX can give you over 40% APR and despite that, no one seems willing to. Most tokens that are farmed are aggressively sold. But these protocols need liquidity depth because they are issuing their token for other expenses and that only is an incentive if there is some place to sell the token. Bancor can insure the IL, which means lower risk, which means higher liquidity per issuance.\n\nThe bnTokens are another change I don't think is fully appreciated yet. Just like Balancer is changing voting to use a BAL/ETH LP token, other DAOs can change their voting token to be a bnToken. This provides the protocol with deeper liquidity without having separate Pool-2 expenses. If nothing else, the issuance could be tied to voter participation rewards instead of straight farm and dump rewards.\n\nThe risk with Bancor is the same as it's greatest strength: IL insurance. If the riskiest tokens are the ones getting the best deal from Bancor then we can expect that's where they'll go! But can Bancor survive insuring the IL if the majority of liquidity it attracts is this long tail of higher risk tokens? That remains to be seen. There's definitely a LUNA style bank run scenario possible with Bancor. Ultimately your IL is insured by BNT as a backstop. If there is a lot of IL and there is a race for the exit the BNT minted via IL insurance will be heavily sold and drive down the BNT price. Later exiters will then mint more BNT per bnToken withdrawn (just like LUNA) which will drive the BNT price down harder and faster (just like LUNA). It's the Bancor Bank Run scenario. It's ultimately up to the protocol to manage the liquidity depth in response to market conditions to prevent IL in the first place. Tokemak does this with their weekly voting rounds and active liquidity management. This pushes accountability for mismanagement onto TOKE voters. BNT pushes the risk onto BNT holders but without the same active voting system. If IL is actually as bad as Bancor says in their press pieces how can Bancor insure depositers against it and absorb all those losses while remaining profitable? If they can't, then all depositers are taking extraordinary risks without realizing it. I'd personally like to see a dashboard with the IL stats such as the IL per pool and IL/BNT market cap ratio.\n\nI think a combination of Curve + Bancor can win the AMM wars over Uniswap in the long term. They just treat their LPs better and combined they handle the fat head and long tail of liquidity with more nuance than Uniswap. I like Tokemak too but it got voted off the island.\n\n**7) Alchemix**. There is so much going on here I don't know where to start. They are revamping their tokenomics. They are deploying to multi-chain, Arbitrum next. They are adding new ibAsset vaults that are exciting. They are putting the transmuter funds to work in an AMO that generates DAO profits. They are adding a gamified NFT layer eventually. They have tokenized bribes with their materia shards. They even added a delegation feature no one is talking about but which I think can be used to avoid income tax. I'm writing a Logris' Vault system on top of their v2 as well.\n\nThe risks I'm aware of atm is their token price and rapidly depleting transmuter reserves but everything the devs are doing is solid, if slow.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Alright, time for another ManeNet Protocol Runoff post! <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/un1xdr/daily_general_discussion_may_11_2022/i88bpvp/?context=3\">Here</a> were my picks from last week.

No need for complex interop with all client pairs since consensus and execution will be fully decoupled post-merge.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-20 12:35:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i9d84ax","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_utlsws","parent_id":"t1_i9coma9","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/SeaMonkey82","body":"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/  \n  \nConsidering they are targeting 2023, I would say no, but I'm not a developer.  \n  \n*edit* [Relevant Bankless panel on sharding from 2022-05-13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5p0TB77flM)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/\">https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Considering they are targeting 2023, I would say no, but I&#39;m not a developer.  </p>\n\n<p><em>edit</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5p0TB77flM\">Relevant Bankless panel on sharding from 2022-05-13</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-20 10:27:14","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-21 04:27:22","id":"i9cr64a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_utlsws","parent_id":"t1_i9coma9","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/wanglubaimu","body":">targeting 2023\n\nThat's 2023 Lubins ;) \n\nI'm also not an expert but to me it sounds like sharding will be harder than the merge.

Yet huge value accrues at the land value (think the price of an empty lot) simply because you get access to a natural monopoly.  Essentially this means tons of money goes to people who own land for doing essentially zero work.  In economic justice terms this is essentially immoral. A much more fair system would be a collective ownership of the land where value is distributed more justly to the collective. With the goal of providing some amount of land to every individual. Improvements and all rights should still be owned by the individual for the positive benefits that provides as well as incentives to continue land improvement.\n\nOK so how in the world do we get there?  Idea time.  A LandDAO which buys the land \"ownership\" in combination with an individual who gets rights to live there essentially in perpetuity and has all claims to improvements to the land.  The LandDAO uses increase in value (hand-wave specific mechanics here... although I've actually thought of a few, aka fractionalizing an NFT of the land deed ownership and LPing it on Uniswap) in order to purchase new land with additional individuals and rinse repeat. The LandDAO would only purchase primary homes with individuals since the end goal is to have everyone have access to home ownership, thus various things like land speculation etc actually fund subsidizing the purchase of homes for new homeowners. It could even build new homes since we're in dire need of increased housing supply. Eventually the DAO would own enough land/homes to ensure everyone gets a house. \n\nSo you could sell your home to the LandDAO knowing that it is unwinding the inequality wedge that home prices are driving in society plus subsidizing homeownership for first time owners.  And on top of that you get to put your money into an actually productive asset like ETH instead of housing which isn't productive at all. \n\nHousing SHOULD be a solved problem. It's not like we don't have the ability to house everyone. Obviously not everyone can have the best/perfect house but at least everyone could have something acceptable.

Rant over :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The dream project: a collective land ownership DAO. </p>\n\n<p>Owning land (the dirt, not the improvements aka buildings etc) isn&#39;t a productive endeavor, only the improvements on the land.  Yet huge value accrues at the land value (think the price of an empty lot) simply because you get access to a natural monopoly.  Essentially this means tons of money goes to people who own land for doing essentially zero work.  In economic justice terms this is essentially immoral. A much more fair system would be a collective ownership of the land where value is distributed more justly to the collective. With the goal of providing some amount of land to every individual. Improvements and all rights should still be owned by the individual for the positive benefits that provides as well as incentives to continue land improvement.</p>\n\n<p>OK so how in the world do we get there?  Idea time.  A LandDAO which buys the land &quot;ownership&quot; in combination with an individual who gets rights to live there essentially in perpetuity and has all claims to improvements to the land.  The LandDAO uses increase in value (hand-wave specific mechanics here... although I&#39;ve actually thought of a few, aka fractionalizing an NFT of the land deed ownership and LPing it on Uniswap) in order to purchase new land with additional individuals and rinse repeat. The LandDAO would only purchase primary homes with individuals since the end goal is to have everyone have access to home ownership, thus various things like land speculation etc actually fund subsidizing the purchase of homes for new homeowners. It could even build new homes since we&#39;re in dire need of increased housing supply. Eventually the DAO would own enough land/homes to ensure everyone gets a house. </p>\n\n<p>So you could sell your home to the LandDAO knowing that it is unwinding the inequality wedge that home prices are driving in society plus subsidizing homeownership for first time owners.  And on top of that you get to put your money into an actually productive asset like ETH instead of housing which isn&#39;t productive at all. </p>\n\n<p>Housing SHOULD be a solved problem. It&#39;s not like we don&#39;t have the ability to house everyone. Obviously not everyone can have the best/perfect house but at least everyone could have something acceptable. It&#39;s just a coordination game problem like so many others.  This is the type of stuff I imagine crypto disrupting that feels so entrenched but would truly make so many people&#39;s lives better.

The cultural hurdle to convince people they don't need to own the land might be too high.  This happens in townhomes and condos, but you pay a fee to the land owner for maintenance.
