I'm not just 'in it for the tech' either. While there are some beautiful design elements to blockchain architecture my initial impression of Solidity contract development and the supporting tools hasn't impressed me as much as other tech stacks I've had to learn.

The short answer is this field is the only place seriously making progress on the single most important topic in all of history: human coordination.\n\nOutside of crypto, progress on human coordination proceeds at the snails pace of decades and centuries. Occasionally a new nation is founded and there's an interesting innovation in a constitution such as checks and balances or ranked-choice voting. Sometimes a new company is founded that has a cooperative ownership structure or offers some new technology like upvote systems that allow us to scale up a network of content authors and direct community attention to the best, most relevant data. But in Defi, new DAOs are seemingly founded every day. Each DAO inspires the creation and restructuring of other DAOs. Today we see the rise of inalienable reputational influence in the Optimism DAO, tokenized bribe influence in the Alchemix tokenomics revision, the rise of liquidity provider tokens as capital voting tokens, and retroactive influence redistribution based on the predictive power of voters.\n\nSo why, is this so important? The pillars of technology that enable our destruction have far outpaced the pillar of technology that prevents it. All of our greatest threats are planetary in scale. This ranges from antibiotic overuse, to ocean acidification, climate change, nuclear proliferation, and wealth inequality. Solving those challenges by definition requires coordination at both an individual and international scale. Our usual solution to forcing uncooperative parties to behave is to coerce them using military force. \"When reason fails, might prevails.\" This does not work at an international scale without a world government with unified military. To solve the largest problems facing humanity today we need to replace military coercion with economic coercion.\n\nCrypto, through smart contracts, offers solutions **uniquely** suited to solving these planetary scale coordination problems. A solution needs to be opt-in because no global government exists to coerce all network participants militarily. Since the incentive system is economic in nature there needs to be a unified monetary system attached to it binding all participants. This monetary system needs to be neutral and not belong to any one participant or you\u2019re basically granting governance rights to a single participant which the rest will not agree to. Executing these incentives needs to be scalable which basically implies a program needs to do it but that program needs to be uncorruptable to be trustable.

You'll have lots of opportunities to find Kona coffee at [Hodlercon](https://hodlercon.com/).\r  \n\r  \nThe coffee shrubs are cultivated on the slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa in the North and South Kona Districts of the Big Island of Hawaii. The weather of sunny mornings, cloud or rain in the afternoon, little wind, and mild nights combined with porous, mineral-rich volcanic soil create favorable coffee growing conditions.\r  \n\r  \nThe Kona Coffee Belt is a recognized \"terroir\" located on Hualalai Mountain and Mauna Loa, ranging from 500 to 3200 feet above sea level. It starts from Hawaii Route 190 on Palani Road, with Makalei being its most northern section, includes Koloko, goes through Hawaii Route 180, also called North Kona Road or Kona Heritage Corridor, passes through Holualoa, and merges with Hawaii Route 11 at Kainaliu and extends through Kealakekua and H\u014dnaunau.\r  \n\r  \nKona coffee beans are classified by law according to seed. Type I beans consist of two beans per cherry, flat on one side, oval on the other. Type II beans consist of one round bean per cherry, otherwise known as peaberries. Further grading of these two types of beans depends on size, moisture content, and purity of bean type. The grades of type I Kona coffee are 'Kona Extra Fancy', 'Kona Fancy', 'Kona Number 1', 'Kona Select', and 'Kona Prime'. The grades of type II Kona coffee are 'Peaberry Number 1' and 'Peaberry Prime'. Also, a lower grade of coffee, called 'Number 3' (or 'Triple X') can not legally be labeled as \"Kona\" but as 'Hawaiian' coffee. Any bean grade below Number 3 is considered 'Offgrade' coffee and can only be labeled as generic coffee. Not an official classification grade, but commonly used by Kona coffee farmers, is the 'Estate' grade where the various grades are not being separated from each other. Only the 'Number 3' and 'Offgrade' beans are being sorted out.\r  \n\r  \nBecause of the rarity and price of Kona coffee, some retailers sell \"Kona Blends.\" These are not a combination of different Kona coffees, but a blend of Kona and Colombian, Brazilian, or other foreign coffees. Usually they contain only the minimum required 10 percent Kona coffee and 90 percent cheaper imported beans.\r  \n\r  \nCurrent Hawaiian law requires blends to state only the percentage of Kona coffee on the label but not any other coffee origins. There is no matching Federal law. Some retailers use terms such as \"Kona Roast\" or \"Kona Style.\" To be considered authentic Kona coffee, the state of Hawaii's labeling laws require the prominent display of the words \"100% Kona Coffee.\"","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Kona coffee is one of the most expensive coffees in the world, though considerably less so than civet coffee.
