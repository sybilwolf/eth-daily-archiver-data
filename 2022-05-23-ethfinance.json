In that time 2.3 million ETH has been burned, resulting in an average net reduction of 60%.\n\nWhile the UX improvement has been outstanding ([Yay for predictable fees and reduced transaction wait times!](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1483110996931534850)) there's so much more to the story. \n\n**EIP-1559 is a work of economic beauty that speaks to Ethereum's unique strengths**\n\nThe feature that makes Ethereum most different from the Bitcoin network is that Ethereum supports an economy.\n\nIn a deflationary economy, currency increases in value in real terms, so individuals have a financial incentive to not spend money - they have an incentive to remove money from the economy, take less risk, and store their wealth for the future as it will have grow in value by simply doing nothing. This is great for the individual agent, who can put aside their hard earned cash at ease and expect to be able to pay their bills tomorrow. Unfortunately it\u2019s terrible for the economy at large, which sees vast sums leave circulation, reduced economic participation, and reduced investment in innovation.\n\nIn an inflationary economy, currency deteriorates in value in real terms, so individuals have a financial incentive to put money into the economy to grow it in order to match the pace of inflation. Calling this an incentive is a bit misleading - it\u2019s much worse than that. I work hard, earn some cash, and have no choice but to take on investment risk lest I take the default option of watching my money slowly erode in front of me. This is great for the economy as huge financial inflows pour into economic circulation to avoid the death knell of inflation. Economic participation increases, there is more investment in innovation. However, this is awful for individual investors - it leaves them with a default option of slowly watching their savings erode and effectively forces them to participate in economic activity as their only alternative is to let their savings wither away.\n\nHere\u2019s the beauty of EIP-1559 - it\u2019s adaptive. \n\nEIP-1559 makes Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy reflexively adapt to economic activity.\n\nIf there is a huge wave of investment and economic activity on the network, fees will rise and higher fee burn will make ETH a deflationary asset. Incentives will shift towards storing money in ETH and not spending it.\n\nIf there is a huge wave towards using ETH as a store of value and economic activity on the network declines, fees will decline and lower fee burn will make ETH an inflationary asset. Incentives will shift towards using ETH on chain to participate in the digital economy.\n\nUltimately, the core economic innovation of EIP-1559 is that it creates harmony between the need for a core incentive towards increasing economic participation and investment in innovation and the need for the core economic unit to be an effective store of value, protecting economic participants from the deterioration of their hard-earned labor.\n\nThis is economic beauty. Ether is reflexively deflationary when it is most able to be, and inflationary when economic activity is most necessary. It is a monetary policy that is built to last - one that adaptively shifts to protect the economy from the most dire risks of the present, whether those risks are inflationary or deflationary extremes.\n\n**EIP-1559 has tied the value of ETH to the Ethereum network**\n\nEIP-1559 ensures that miners cannot be paid with any token other than unstaked ETH. Prior to EIP-1559 it was already the case that ETH was being paid as gas during every transaction, but now the door is closed to workarounds. \n\nThis mechanism  captures economic value created by the use of the network, and it buys us resistance to economic abstraction. With EIP-1559, ETH has a special place on the Ethereum network as the only asset that is able to pay for the protocol fee.\n\nThe value captured by this mechanism is removed from the supply, making ETH a scarcer asset. If I buy 1 ETH and use it as gas, miners can only sell 0.4ETH to take profits. 60% of the fees in every transaction are transformed into an effective share repurchase.\n\nImportantly, in a proof-of-stake paradigm the annual fee burn cannot go above some percentage of unstaked ETH without moving price. \n\nThe reason why is because agents buying ETH for use as gas are gas price sensitive, **not** ETH price sensitive. As unstaked ETH prices go up, gas prices don't need to rise. These are agents who cannot replace their price insensitive ETH buying with buying of staked ETH derivatives. They're limited to unstaked ETH only.\n\nThe inevitable result is that the price of unstaked ETH must rise so that gas fee burn represents a smaller percentage of unstaked ETH, OR demand for gas must fall. \n\nThis is where the network's value accrues to price. After the merge, there will be a lower limit where ETH prices will be forcibly moved by Ethereum network activity itself.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* EIP-1559 makes Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy reflexively adapt to economic activity\n\n* EIP-1559 has tied the value of the ETH to the Ethereum network","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>EIP-1559 has been live for 9 months now.

There are so many factors (macro, the merge, crypto ecosystem fuck ups like UST, etc.), so it's 100% speculation.\n\nWhat I can talk about is my learnings from the 2018-2020 bear market. I made my first buy literally on the top of the ETH blow off top in Jan 2018. I basically only knew bear markets for a long time. I was the stupid retail buyer that doubled down too many times, I was exit liquidity.  Most of the things here will be obvious to many. Some will say that the things I am writing might be too late, and they might be right.\n\n* Alts underperform ETH/BTC: I was buying alts for a long time in 2018/2019. I doubled down on so many \"last cycle\" coins, it hurt. While some these coins made decent runs in 2020/21 (making the investments USD profitable), most of the time an investment in ETH would have been (way!) better. This applies both for buys during the bear market (and coins continuing to dip, but ETH dipping less than altcoins), but also for the bull market (coins going up, ETH outperforming last cycles altcoins). Coins can go down 90% only to go down another 90%. Sadly crypto surprises us when it comes to the downside (but it also surprises to the upside). \n* Last cycle alts won't come back: This is obviously somehow connected to the first point, but there is some details here I'd like to point out. Most of last cycles altcoins will survive, they might even still be in the top 100 (like XRP, which somehow still is top10), but they are not the ones that will push the market into a bullish direction. Bear markets are for builders and the results of their work *right now* will make a difference soon. DeFi was new in 2020 and most of the protocols were built in the time when no ones was thinking about crypto and the market was dying. There will be exceptions and some defi protocols might make it, but I would assume that picking the winner will be very hard. E.g. I wanna buy dydx because I really believe in the product, but I am not sure it will really be a good investment.\n* Now is the time to pay attention: If you stick around now, you will make it. Not as in generational wealth, but you're way more likely to understand narratives (\"meta\") and what will change the market at one point. Imagine identifying the next defi (not as in defi 3.0, but as in the new meta that will lift the market) and receiving airdrops, being able to yield farm or whatsoever. I wasn't paying enough attention in 2020 and missed defi summer, both because I didn't spend enough time to learn about whats happening and because I wasn't open enough to play around a bit.

During her lifetime, she experienced and encountered the decline of her Hawaiian people. She was well aware that education was key to the survival of her people and culture; therefore, she left 375,000 acres of ancestral land, entrusting her trustees to use this gift to educate her people, specifically native Hawaiians.\n\nAfter Bishop's death in 1884, her husband Charles Reed Bishop carried out her will and organized a school on a model of European-American education.\u200a The original Kamehameha School for Boys opened in 1887; after it moved to a new campus, that site was taken over by the Bishop Museum, which remains today.

Because far more applicants claim Hawaiian ancestry than the schools can admit, virtually all students have some Native Hawaiian ancestry. Non-Hawaiians have attended, but this is extremely rare.

A big criticism of Yuga has been that they seem to not be accessible for the general user since the mints are expensive and current holders get priority/airdrops ($APE).  Maybe this is them leveling the playing field?\n\nThat was pretty much enough to make me scratch the degen-mode itch and I bought 3 NFTs for an average of .35 ETH on Saturday.  Probably dumb!
