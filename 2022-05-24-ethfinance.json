Networks become more centralized when full nodes are not easily accessible.\n\nEthereum has long prioritized security and decentralization over scalability at the base layer. With the pivot to a [rollup centric roadmap,](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) Ethereum is leveraging its base layer to offer robust data availability in place of L1 scalability while still maintaining security and decentralization.\n\nThe intention of this pivot is that the majority of the execution on the Ethereum network we're used to today (DeFi, NFTs, etc) will move to rollups instead of occurring on mainnet. Because rollups inherit security from mainnet Ethereum, the same trilemma does not apply to them. With the hard parts handled by Ethereum, rollups are able to focus on being the best execution layer possible.\n\nWhen Ethereum undergoes its metamorphosis from a monolithic chain to a modular system, it changes the dynamics of the competition. L1 smart contract blockchains are no longer competing with Ethereum directly. They are competing with rollups.\n\n**The advent of EVM-compatabile general purpose ZK-rollups will bring about the obsolescence of every other L1 smart contract blockchain.**\n\nThe reality is, with competing implementations and the freedom to focus on execution efficiency, rollups will iterate toward the best versions of themselves at extreme speed.\n\nRollups have superior:\n\n1. Security - Rollups have rich security assurances that enable interesting dynamics like the escape hatch (immutable functions that allow users to exit rollups back to mainnet even if the rollup network is offline), and progressively decentralized sequencers and provers (even a centralized sequencer in a rollup is much safer than centralization in an L1 chain. When using a rollup with a centralized sequencer or prover you are compromising on trust and censorship resistance, but not security - sequencer operators cannot steal your funds and you can always withdraw back to mainnet Ethereum)\n\n2. Data availability - Once Ethereum pivots to a modular system with [danksharding,](https://notes.ethereum.org/@dankrad/new_sharding) rollups will enjoy an abundance of data capacity that will only increase with time. The [sheer amount of nodes and validators](https://imgur.com/XCmgCuN) on the network means Ethereum will possess the highest capacity data availability. Being the ultimate chain for rollups means Ethereum users also get to benefit from alternative data availability solutions only ZK-rollups can bring to the table: Volition and Adamantium; solutions that allow users to choose whether they want or need to utilize on-chain data availability through the volition's rollup, or off-chain data availability through the volition's validium. Both of these solutions are only available to ZK-rollups\n\n3. Costs and throughput - Transaction costs on rollups are already fairly low. But there are far more optimizations on the way which will bring huge reductions in gas costs, and numerous techniques that will be deployed to increase transaction throughput. Validity proof amortization means transactions becomes cheaper as more people submit a batch. This is the complete opposite of monolithic blockchains where demand for blockspace increases as the amount of active users increases, causing a surge in gas prices. Additionally,  there will be many hundreds of rollups operating in parallel. Each capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of users. Each with their own enormous thoughput. All powered and secured by Ethereum. In the event one rollup is saturated, it will be trivial to hop over to another rollup and begin transacting\n\n4. Privacy - Privacy is not inherent to Ethereum, but work is being done for ZK-rollups to allow permissionless privacy. Recursive proofs, the act of verifying a proof inside of another proof, is a a handy compression technique that allows for greater efficiency and reduced privacy costs.\n\n5. Flexibility - ZK-rollups enjoy the freedom to innovate on multiple fronts without the risks of catastrophic failure that L1 chains carry. One of the key principles of a rollup-centric roadmap for Ethereum is that the free market is being sourced to discover all of the best ways to build a rollup, rather than a small group of core developers making the assumption of what should be best. Because developing and deploying a rollup is a permissionless endeavor, we\u2019ll see many different approaches to rollups in the race to onboard users. This includes varying styles of governance, tokenomics and liquidity incentives, different tradeoffs within the decentralization spectrum, different expressions of ideology, and even different choices of VM environments. Other L1 smart contract blockchains cannot iterate on any of these as rapidly as rollups can.\n\n6. Applications - Outsourcing computation and data availability enables a host of [new on-chain applications that are not feasible on mainnet Ethereum](https://medium.com/starkware/a-thundering-herd-the-rise-of-l2-native-dapps-290598f6477f) or any other smart contract platform online today. It also allows us to build superior versions of any existing on-chain product.\n\nZK-rollups bring a lot to the table, and Ethereum will soon be positioned to let them flourish to the best of their abilities.\n\nOver the course of 2020/21 we saw a number of \"cheap and fast\" EVM chains spring up. We\u2019ve also seen chains come online with the promise of having \u201cdefeated the scalability trilemma!\u201d at the base layer, waving away at the notion of scaling in layers (what they really mean is they have sacrificed decentralization for speed and security.)\n\nIt should be clear by now that general computation ZK-rollups will be more secure, faster, more decentralized, more adaptive and flexible, and more lightweight than any L1 smart contract chain could ever hope to be. Each standalone \nL1 chain will be carrying unnecessary security overhead and risks while being an inferior product.\n\nThe pragmatic solution in the future is for these chains to relinquish their redundant consensus mechanisms and data availability and become a ZK-rollup or volition. They should assimilate to Ethereum\u2019s best-in-class security, its data availability, and its settlement assurances.\n\nOutsourcing the legwork of consensus and security to Ethereum will allow these chains to focus strictly on execution. In a post-sharded, post-rollup dominance world, this is their shot at retaining relevance. Their security baggage will otherwise be far too heavy to keep up. This will be a reality that becomes exponentially clearer - cacophonously obvious - over time. It will be impossible to justify the negligence.\n\nWe are on the verge of a gargantuan paradigm shift that will forever change the crypto ecosystem. ZK-rollups will scale Ethereum and they will do the best job of it. The paradigm shift is strong enough that it very clearly marks the beginning of the end for every L1 smart contract chain - even Ethereum as we know it today.\n\nThere have been many different propositions for scaling. Thousands of hours of research, implementation, success, and failure have gone toward finding the right way to create this proverbial light bulb - and, of course, the work is far from over. The road ahead is full of twists and turns, but the destination has never been clearer.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nEthereum has pivoted to a rollup centric roadmap.

Thought I'd pop in here with some of what I've learned, half as advice for qf contributors and half as thoughts/reflections.\n\nConceptually, BrightID is all about making a graph of connections between people, upon which any number of algorithms can be run to classify nodes (users) as unique humans or potential duplicates. In practice, there are two forms of verification: Meets and Bitu. The ethstaker qf round claims to accept either (though some people claim to not be getting through despite Bitu verification)\n\n***\n\n**Meets verification** can be done by joining a BrightID verification party, or Meet. From the BrightID app, if you go into the \"achievements\" page and tap on the meets achievement, it'll take you to [the list of upcoming meetings](https://meet.brightid.org/#/). There are a number of meetings (on zoom) every day, with a range of languages. No need to pre-register, just hop in to any you want.\n\nIn a BrightID meet, there will be a host who guides you through the process. You will have to connect to their BrightID profile, then the host will go through the connections they received one by one and **ask each person to say hi and show their face on camera**. If you don't mind doing so, a meet is an easy way to get verified. Trying to get around this with masks or other face coverings may get you grief from the host and possibly reported as suspicious. 30 minutes after the meeting is over you should receive your Meet verification, which is sufficient to participate in the funding round.\n\n***\n\n**Bitu verification** is more complicated, and is based on the connections users make. When you connect with a user, you will be asked to clarify the person as \"already known\" (high confidence they're not a bot/duplicate, ideally because you knew them beforehand), \"just met\" (lower confidence), or \"suspicious\" (for when you randomly receive a connection request and have no idea who it is). Where you draw the line between \"already known\" and \"just met\" is up to you, I personally was willing to say \"already known\" to any verified EVM holders with a moderate history of posting on the discord, but you can decide for yourself. In a connection both people set each other's connection level, and it doesn't need to match.\n\n*Bitu details*: Some users known by BrightID to be trusted are listed as seeds. Seed users are always considered to be Bitu verified. Each user's Bitu score is the number of bidirectional \"already known\" connections they have with other Bitu-verified users. So you can see each solid connection as a +1 to your score, and verification propagates outwards from the seeds. In the case of a connection where A rates B as \"already known\" but B rates A as \"suspicious\", A gets a -5 to their score, and anyone else connected to A gets a -1. This is the risk in setting unknown users as \"already known\": they can always choose to stab you in the back. If you ever remove a connection with someone, it changes your connection level to them as \"reported\", which I think gives them a -5 regardless of their connection level with you.\n\n**Important Bitu takeaways**: Your Bitu score only increases if you make connections with Bitu-verified users where both people say the other is \"already known\". As a corollary, making connections where either person rates the other as \"just met\" does *nothing* for either person's Bitu score. If you are specifically trying to get Bitu-verified, it's kind of a waste of time to connect with anyone who is not both Bitu-verified and willing to make a bidirectional \"already known\" connection.\n\nWe had an incident yesterday where one EVMavs member was struggling to understand Bitu verification and tried removing their connections to start over and try again. Myself and a few other members managed to achieve Bitu 3, but when someone removes you as a connection it considers that a \"report\", giving you a -5 and your other connections a -1. This user then gave up altogether and deleted the app without setting up social recovery, making the reports irreversible as far as I can tell. So this one user accidentally (I really don't blame them: the system, and particularly the app UI, is confusing!) nuked our collective Bitu verification. Just be aware of the report system and don't remove connections lightly.\n\n***\n\nA number of discord users walked away disillusioned with BrightID, as hours of effort at getting Bitu-verified didn't go anywhere (mainly because of lack of clarity around the system, not necessarily the report nuke). It definitely feels like a big hurdle to jump just to give away your money. I feel a little better about it than most, but only because I spent all day trying to understand it. I think if we started out with more people who were Bitu-verified and understood the Bitu system and could act as guides, things would have gone more smoothly. I still have hope that BrightID can catch on and find success.\n\nIn the meantime, I am still interested in regaining my Bitu verification (and finding a way to remove the effect of the report, if possible). Once I'm back in Bituland I would be happy to help with last-minute qf verification. I am also happy to answer questions and help people understand the process, here or on the EVMavs discord.

It takes 5 minutes and might cost $20 in gas (HOP protocol fees are ridiculously low, but you'll need to pay mainnet gas to get to Arbitrum).\n\n* Once you get some Ether to Arbitrum, go to [Uniswap on Arbitrum](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=arbitrum) and swap your Ether for DAI.\n\n* Now you're set! Go to https://qf.ethstaker.cc and choose up to 8 projects to fund.

I&#39;d just say there is some cognitive dissonance between the numbers I&#39;m reading and the price action. Clearly there is a lot of farm and dump pressure and it&#39;s outweighing accumulation by any DAOs.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"https://zapper.fi/account/0xa86e412109f77c45a3bc1c5870b880492fb86a14\">Best answer I could find</a> for how the reactor liquidity is deployed.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-24 17:49:22","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-24 18:06:36","id":"i9vl9ol","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uwj41l","parent_id":"t3_uwj41l","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/tutamtumikia","body":"I managed to make it years without putting money into dumb ass coins but Tokemak got me good.

The primary goal of the voyage was to explore the anthropological theory of the Asiatic origin of native Oceanic people, of Polynesians and Hawaiians in particular, as the result of purposeful trips through the Pacific, as opposed to passive drifting on currents, or sailing from the Americas.\n\nBetween the 1976 voyage and 2009, H\u014dk\u016ble\u2018a completed nine additional voyages to Micronesia, Polynesia, Japan, Canada and the mainland United States, all using ancient wayfinding techniques of celestial navigation. In May 2014, H\u014dk\u016ble\u2018a and her sister vessel, Hikianalia, embarked from Oahu for a three-year circumnavigation of the earth. She returned to port in Hawaii in June 2017.
