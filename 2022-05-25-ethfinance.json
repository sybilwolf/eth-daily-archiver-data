We now have two chains running almost independantly:\n\n1. The Ethereum chain, the proof-of-work chain that keeps track of the Ethereum network state and transactions. [Ethereum blocks](https://etherscan.io/block/14517750) currently contain all execution data - the current state, executed transactions and their receipts\n\n2. The Beacon chain, the proof-of-stake chain that keeps track of validator participation to the conensus, and of the 32 ETH deposits. [Beacon chain blocks](https://beaconcha.in/block/3517562) currently contain all data related to the votes made by validators which agree on the current state of the chain\n\nEach of these blockchains currently run with different software clients:\n\n1. The Ethereum chain clients manage the transactions mempool, the EVM execution and are connected with the p2p network of Ethereum nodes to share the Ethereum blocks\n\n2. The Beacon chain clients are connected to the P2P network of Beacon nodes to share the Beacon chain blocks. They are also connected with an Ethereum node in order to fetch the deposits made on the Ethereum chain, that will then be verified to activate a validator\n\nAfter the merge, only one blockchain will exist and [its blocks](https://beaconchain.kiln.themerge.dev/block/170272) will include the execution data and the proof-of-stake consensus data. The post-merge Ethereum chain will manage 2 parallel states: the execution state (ETH accounts, smart contracts variables etc.), and the consensus state (active validators, deposits, validators balance etc.)\n\nTo manage those 2 different states, the chain will still be run by the two types of clients we saw previously: execution clients will manage execution state, whereas consensus clients will manage the consensus state. The consensus nodes are still peered together, and the execution nodes too, but a new engine API enables more communications between consensus and execution clients.\n\nWhen the merge update is complete, miners will no longer exist and transaction fee rewards and tips will be sent to validators in the execution data of each block. The 2 ETH issued per block by the network on Ethereum PoW will be reduced by ~90% after the Merge. Therefore, there will be multiple reward streams post-merge for validators, some in the consensus state and some on the execution state.\n\nThe merge will not enable withdrawals, meaning that the 32 staked ETH used to activate a validator plust their consensus rewards will still be locked on the consensus level.

What behaviour does this incentivize? A little example: Your retirement fund can not be touched by you for the next 30 years. Assume 50k in the fund and a deflation of, in average, 3%. The actual value you have left in 30 years is pretty much exactly 20k. So, there is little incentives to save this money, but lots to take out loans to repay them later when the currency is debased. If you combine that with a fractional reserve system, it doesn't take a lot to see, that this is wildly unsustainable. I guess you have already realized that this is basically what happened in 2008.\n\nSo, inflation incentives spending, which leads to higher demand, which leads to even higher devaluation (2020, 2021), which then obviously leads to a backlash (2022) as most people realize they can't not afford nearly as much as they thought anymore. Panic sets in and artificially surpressed volatility strikes back twice as hard. A phenomenon that can be seen all through nature. An interesting one is wildfires.

This leads to competition, rivalry and inevitably war. These wars can drag along till either human or material ressources are depleted as the war can be funded almost till infinity as the central authority has the possibility to create value out of thin air. This will of course debase the currency, but atm it can be seen with the Rubel how long it takes till it has actual consequnces for a regime and how many tricks exist to kick this can down the road. Inflation funds the most total of wars with all its consequences.\n\nLast but not least you have to outpace inflation if you want to make steps forward in your personal life. This means extracting value from your environment on a faster pace than erosion of monetary value. This leads to horrific working conditions and the exploitation of nature. We're in the aeon of the Anthropocene. It is all but clear where this experiment will lead us, but it will leave its trace on the planet for millions of years to come, be it in the atmosphere, hydrosphere or lithosphere.

And if that's the case, doesn't it weaken the argument he makes that this money will continue to flow in to ethereum at the same rate after the merge? Maybe it's more likely that the market will continue to find balance at $2000-$3000? \n\nMaybe the more important thing is actually what the market agrees the price ought to be, not how much implied daily sell pressure is created by issuance every day? I think in the short term, the market might not go on a crazy run; it won't react to the change in dynamics very quickly. We've certainly seen significant delay in the effects of the BTC halvenings on the market price.\n\nHal argued that narrative follows price, which I believe to be at least somewhat true.

The shadows that are cast are small and can have unusual properties; e.g. trees&#39; shadows reveal the trees&#39; dendritic patterns.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1990s the Bishop Museum held a contest to name the phenomenon the people chose Lahaina Noon, which translates as &quot;cruel sun.&quot; The ancient Hawaiian name for the event was &quot;kau ka l\u0101 i ka lolo,&quot; which translates as &quot;the sun rests on the brains.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>During Lahaina Noon near Honolulu City Hall, the undulating sculpture &quot;Sky Gate&quot; by Isamu Noguchi forms a perfectly circular shadow around a central disk. There will be a free concert at the sculpture to mark the occasion, which is tomorrow (May 26) at 12:29 p.m. (it&#39;s not exactly at chronological noon because our timekeeping system does not rely on solar noon).</p>\n\n<p>The phenomenon also inspired the book of poetry &quot;Lahaina Noon&quot; by Eric Paul Shaffer.</p>\n\n<p>Lahaina Noon will not occur anywhere in the main islands during Hodlercon, but it will return to Honolulu on July 16 and on other dates elsewhere as listed <a href=\"https://www.bishopmuseum.org/lahaina-noon/\">here</a>. Between the dates of Lahaina Noon, those of us living north of the Tropic of Cancer may be slightly disoriented by the sensation of the sun being in the north at midday and casting shadows to the south rather than vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere on earth \u2014 the subsolar point \u2014 always is experiencing Lahaina Noon and can be found at <a href=\"https://rl.se/sub-solar-point\">https://rl.se/sub-solar-point</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Only seven days until registration closes!
