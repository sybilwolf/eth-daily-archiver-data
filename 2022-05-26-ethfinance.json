I just recently passed 5 years since my first ETH purchase. This community has meant a lot to me over that time, so I want to ramble about some important lessons I\u2019ve learned.\n\n1. Do not fucking blow yourself up. For the love of god. There are so many ways to lose your money. Don\u2019t chase 180% APR paid in YAMs. I have watched so many people gain and lose millions of dollars due to very understandable mistakes. Take every precaution to protect yourself from those outcomes. If you do find yourself in that situation, though\u2026 forgive yourself. Think of the loss as paying for education. Personally, I have lost money doing almost every single crypto activity I\u2019ve ever tried. One time I sold ETH for fucking $108. It\u2019s okay. You will survive. Keep your eye on the ball.\n\n2. Monitor your mental health. It doesn\u2019t matter if you think you have diamond hands. Money is inherently emotional. Watching the number go down will bring a stress response that can manifest in insidious ways. Every single seasoned crypto investor has taken some huge losses. I would recommend reading The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel, but also please talk to a therapist if crypto is really dominating your thinking in a negative way.\n\n3. Time is your most valuable resource. Saving time could mean filtering your twitter feed, simplifying your investment approach, or picking one sub-area of Ethereum where you\u2019d like to focus. Don\u2019t try to do everything at once. Learn which educators tend to align with your personal values. \n\n4. Don\u2019t be scared to try new things. Trying new products is the most rewarding thing you can do in crypto. We are working on bleeding edge software applications and it\u2019s exciting to be some of the first humans to try out new things. It\u2019s also financially rewarding. Honestly, though\u2026 money shouldn\u2019t matter at all. Trying new stuff is most of my reason for being here.\n\n5. PARTICIPATE. I was a lurker for more than two years before I started commenting here. It is so much more rewarding to have ongoing conversations with people compared to reading this thread like a news article. For example, I remember one of my first comments was about superphiz\u2019s first public appearance. It\u2019s so cool to see friends grow within the community over time.\n\nLife isn\u2019t all about money. Money is pretty fucking stupid tbh. If you have been ruminating about markets over the past however many weeks, feel free to hit my DMs. Life is complicated.\n\nLove others. Forgive yourself. Move forward.\n\nEthereum.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019m going to turn 30 years old in two weeks. I just recently passed 5 years since my first ETH purchase.

Did the creation of bitcoin forks like litecoin, dogecoin, bitcoin cash, or any of the countless others make bitcoin no longer scarce?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>the monetary policies have changed multiple times, dramatically, over the last couple years, with more to come with the merge. To pretend that the current plan moving forward is fixed in stone in lunacy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a straw man argument. I&#39;ve never claimed that the monetary policy is fixed. My claim is that the fact that the monetary policy is not fixed does not make the supply of ETH unlimited, and hence does not mean that ETH is not scarce.</p>\n\n<p>The innovation behind the internet was to make data cheap, available, and infinitely copiable. This innovation opened up the world to abundant and cheap information, and humanity is better because of it. However, cheap, available, and copiable is the opposite of what money and value are. Money and value are by definition scarce, expensive, and difficult to access.</p>\n\n<p>When Bitcoin solved the internet\u2019s double-spend problem, it achieved creating internet scarcity. For the first time ever, when you sent something on the internet, you could no longer keep it yourself.</p>\n\n<p>This is the scarcity that Ethereum enables for digital assets on it&#39;s platform. Monetary policy and supply of ETH is not relevant so long as the double-spend problem has been solved</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-26 22:44:38","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-26 23:18:39","id":"ia5tqpo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uxzzat","parent_id":"t1_ia5kiha","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"I can't believe it.

Remember that as the consequences to all of this come into focus.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum could have, would have, saved us from all of this, but obviously we needed more time.  Indeed, I believe it is the fact of Ethereum&#39;s potential that helped set the pace for much of this ruinous change; if you see the day is fast approaching where lies can no longer be propped up through censorship, then the incentive of course is to move on your ruinous plans sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n<p>Normally the damage we suffer today only strengthens us in the long run.  But it appears now that life itself has been weaponized, and joins nuclear <em>everything</em> in making terms like &quot;in the long run&quot; sound like pollyanna.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-26 01:21:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ia1itbn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uxzzat","parent_id":"t1_ia1fho8","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/proto-n","body":"Thanks, that's super interesting.

Please verify the contract address before minting or shopping secondary markets; be careful, there are similarly named projects out there. To find on Opensea search for Hodlercon BeachBums or go to [https://opensea.io/collection/hodlercon-beachbums](https://opensea.io/collection/hodlercon-beachbums). You can view the art there or by scrolling on hodlercon.com.\n\nHodlercon ticket hodlers can redeem these NFTs for only the cost of gas. Ticket hodlers have multiple options to do so:\u2014 Message u/Hawaii_Facts with your booking number, which will be on the ticket confirmation emailed to you, and an Ethereum address for each ticket purchased. You can send this from any Reddit account; we\u2019d prefer you not doxx your main EthFinance handle but it\u2019s fine if you do.\n\n\u2014 Send your booking number and an Ethereum address for each ticket purchased to woh.eth via [chat.blockscan.com](https://chat.blockscan.com).\n\n\u2014 DM your booking number and an Ethereum address for each ticket purchased to u/HodlerCon\n\n\u2014 If you have some other preferred way to send us this information let us know via homing pigeon and we\u2019ll figure it out.\n\nAddresses will be manually whitelisted for the free redemption similar to how Ethereum Virtual Mavericks were done. Each BeachBum redeemed will need a separate address; i.e., if you buy three tickets and want three NFTs, you need to send one booking number and three separate addresses. Each address will need adequate ETH to pay for gas when you do redeem.\n\nHodlercon organizers do not want anything to do with any of your personal identifying information; please take care to use fresh or adequately anonymous addresses and accounts. Booking numbers are provided to us by the third-party event planner without any information beyond number of tickets, time booked and fees paid.\n\nProceeds from the sale go to offsetting community costs for Hodlercon 2022, including event planner fees, food, beverages and activities. Any excess funding will go toward future Hodlercons at the DAO\u2019s (that means BeachBum hodlers\u2019) discretion.\n\nThe BeachBums collection is a community-first project led by volunteers. Proceeds go toward Hodlercon 2022 and future endeavors. A few specialized skills were needed to deliver the BeachBums collection; a small number (on the order of five) BeachBums may be minted and distributed by the Hodlercon multisig to compensate people for their work on the project. The project includes a 5 percent royalty on each sale, which will go toward the Hodlercon DAO to be controlled by BeachBum hodlers. This fee primarily discourages wash trading and sketchy activity while building a kitty for future Hodlercons.\n\nEthFinance moderators reviewed and permitted this message in advance.\n\nThere's also a post in https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/uy9qnw/announcing\\_hodlercon\\_beachbums/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Today&#39;s fact is \u2014 no exaggeration \u2014 the most exciting so far:</p>\n\n<p>Starting now you can mint BeachBum NFTs to support Hodlercon 2022 and determine location, dates and other details of future Hodlercons via a DAO.

You can view the art there or by scrolling on hodlercon.com.</p>\n\n<p>Hodlercon ticket hodlers can redeem these NFTs for only the cost of gas. Ticket hodlers have multiple options to do so:\u2014 Message <a href=\"/u/Hawaii_Facts\">u/Hawaii_Facts</a> with your booking number, which will be on the ticket confirmation emailed to you, and an Ethereum address for each ticket purchased. You can send this from any Reddit account; we\u2019d prefer you not doxx your main EthFinance handle but it\u2019s fine if you do.</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Send your booking number and an Ethereum address for each ticket purchased to woh.eth via <a href=\"https://chat.blockscan.com\">chat.blockscan.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 DM your booking number and an Ethereum address for each ticket purchased to <a href=\"/u/HodlerCon\">u/HodlerCon</a></p>\n\n<p>\u2014 If you have some other preferred way to send us this information let us know via homing pigeon and we\u2019ll figure it out.</p>\n\n<p>Addresses will be manually whitelisted for the free redemption similar to how Ethereum Virtual Mavericks were done. Each BeachBum redeemed will need a separate address; i.e., if you buy three tickets and want three NFTs, you need to send one booking number and three separate addresses. Each address will need adequate ETH to pay for gas when you do redeem.</p>\n\n<p>Hodlercon organizers do not want anything to do with any of your personal identifying information; please take care to use fresh or adequately anonymous addresses and accounts. Booking numbers are provided to us by the third-party event planner without any information beyond number of tickets, time booked and fees paid.</p>\n\n<p>Proceeds from the sale go to offsetting community costs for Hodlercon 2022, including event planner fees, food, beverages and activities. Any excess funding will go toward future Hodlercons at the DAO\u2019s (that means BeachBum hodlers\u2019) discretion.</p>\n\n<p>The BeachBums collection is a community-first project led by volunteers. Proceeds go toward Hodlercon 2022 and future endeavors. A few specialized skills were needed to deliver the BeachBums collection; a small number (on the order of five) BeachBums may be minted and distributed by the Hodlercon multisig to compensate people for their work on the project. The project includes a 5 percent royalty on each sale, which will go toward the Hodlercon DAO to be controlled by BeachBum hodlers. This fee primarily discourages wash trading and sketchy activity while building a kitty for future Hodlercons.</p>\n\n<p>EthFinance moderators reviewed and permitted this message in advance.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also a post in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/uy9qnw/announcing%5C_hodlercon%5C_beachbums/?utm%5C_source=share&amp;utm%5C_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/uy9qnw/announcing\\_hodlercon\\_beachbums/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a>.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-26 08:06:26","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-26 08:14:50","id":"ia2nfow","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uxzzat","parent_id":"t3_uxzzat","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KuDeTa","body":"Woo.

If comments are generally positive or provide the constructive criticism it needs, I'll suggest it after the fork.\n\n* Step 1: Re-peg UST to either $0.01 or $0.05, so that Luna can begin burning. Say $0.05 for now. \n\n* Step 2: TFL needs to lend out the BTC it still has (all whopping 313 of it!) and spend some of the interest payments towards UST. This will begin draining the market of liquidity and provide a guaranteed buyer to begin driving price upwards.\n\n* Step 3: Take the BTC interest you didn't spend on UST and synchronize stepping up UST's peg to the next denomination ($0.05 to $0.10) with taking out a leveraged long on UST (to provide upward market pressure without relying on printing Luna, so that Luna doesn't hyperinflate again). \n\nFundamentally, what got me thinking this way is that while it is normally impossible to use a 1% APY on 300 BTC to recover over $11 Billion in USD in anything like a reasonable timeframe, at the moment the UST you actually need to drain from the market is trading at $0.05, or 1/20th its list price. After the fork, there's a good chance it'll be closer to $0.01. This means that liquidity draining will happen at 100X speed. And one of the beautiful things about being a dead coin is that if you use the arbitrage mechanic baked into Luna to artificially lower UST's price further and the market won't react. The market attention will be focused on the fork. You can (probably) make that liquidity vacuum happen even faster, although that will mean Luna will burn slower. This also means that the chain can theoretically be revitalized with a lot less resources than 300 BTC, but the more BTC you use, the more Luna you can burn, and therefore the lower  Luna issuance at the end. More is better, but it isn't strictly speaking necessary.\n\nMy guess is that if people are actually interested in maintaining the chain and pursuing a reboot strategy like this, it will take probably about 1 year to drain the excess UST and Luna liquidity from the protocol, and at the same time, to build secondary layers of stability beyond arbitrage. The lesson of the day is that maintaining the peg is not *so* important that it's worth destroying the base protocol, so a smart contract which knows when to suspend the arbitrage mechanic and re-peg with an alternate means is the correct way forward. \n\nIf we assume about a 2 month cooldown between each denomination step-up, and an extra stop at $0.75 because jumping straight from $0.50 to $1 is nuts, that means that Luna Classic can recover it's peg in approximately **two years.** As an added bonus, the protocol would have a known way to slowly recover from similar market events in the future, and could spend time between here and there adding even more tactical depth to the protocol's defenses.\n\nI'd say that sounds like a good bear market activity.\n\nIf people are interested, I'll write up a real proposal (I need to know how much UST liquidity is currently on exchanges to make more than a guess).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Continuing my stablecoin brainstorm trends: this is a hypothetical way to re-stabilize the Luna Classic chain after the fork chain proves to be a Fork To Nowhere like I suspect it will.
