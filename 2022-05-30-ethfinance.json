I think one of the biggest things which is easy to understand the value of is the concept of composability of an open source, instantaneous financial system (which also has the benefit of being self-custodial so you can do all of the following things without having to trust a bank or stock broker). This concept often gets the nickname of \"money legos\" because an ecosystem of composable apps means that you can plug in any new app on top of another one again and again until you have a big tower of financial applications (or legos) which all build on top of each other. This isn't possible in the traditional finance system because the system is custodial and therefore involves trusting others with your money and almost all financial software and apps are proprietary, largely because it allows the institutions which create these apps to gatekeep their software and charge a large fee or earn interest on your assets while you let them be your custodian.\n\n>For example, in decentralised finance or \"DeFi\" on Ethereum, you can instantly get a collateralised loan. Literally instantly. No paperwork, credit check or discrimination. If you have an asset, you can leverage the value of that asset and get some cash. This is useful if you have some ETH or another crypto investment which you think will go up in price and don't want to sell but you have a bill which needs paying but you don't have the cash to pay it on time. You can lock up 1 ETH in a \"vault\" on an app like AAVE or Compound and they will give you up to 66% of its value in US dollar stablecoins for a small annual fee of a few percent. If the price of the ETH drops below the value of the dollars they gave you, the app will automatically leave you with the dollars but take your ETH as compensation. Alternatively, if the price of the ETH goes up, you can get your ETH back at any time by paying back the stablecoin amount you were loaned plus interest. As a result, you still have your ETH which has appreciated in value and were able to pay your bill on time without missing out on the upside.\n\n>Now, on the other side of this there are people who are lending their stablecoins for the interest paid by the users getting loans and this is where it gets interesting. Thanks to composable \"money legos\", a new app can plug into this interest rate. My favourite example of this is through an app called Alchemix. Alchemix offers self-repaying loans. In other words, it allows you to get a loan of the future interest bearing value of your asset. So for example, if the interest rate in DeFi for loaning a USD stablecoin or ETH is 5%, you can deposit your savings, lets say 10 ETH (can also be dollars though). It will take your 10 ETH and then start earning interest. Then, it will allow you to take out a loan against that 10 ETH because it knows that if you lock up your ETH for 10 years at 5% you will have earned 5 more ETH in interest (could be longer or shorter if the interest rate on the lending apps AAVE or Compound changes). Once you have deposited your 10 ETH, Alchemix will allow you to mint 5 alETH. This alETH has the same value as 1 ETH because 1 alETH is redeemable for 1 of the ETH you deposited at any time. Once you have your 5 alETH, you can sell them to whatever asset you want, maybe dollars if you want to buy something fancy, lets say a new car, without having to lose price exposure to that ETH. That way you can have your new car now without having to sell your ETH. So if ETH doubles or more in those 10 years, you didn't end up missing out on that value increase, because when the interest pays off the loan you get your original 10 ETH back. Alternatively, if half way through those 10 years you need your original ETH back, all you have to do is return your 5 alETH, minus whatever interest has already been earned (since this has been used to pay back the loan) and get your 10 ETH back.\n\n>This is just one example of a simple two storey money lego which isn't possible in traditional finance because you are plugging in to the instantly accessible interest rate paid out by another application. The reality today after just a few years of DeFi since the first app was created in 2018 is that you have many complex apps which build off one another many storeys high. While this does come with risks, (if the app at the bottom has an exploit/bug, it can cause others to lose collateral and break, leaving users missing funds) the beauty of it is that it is all transparent and open source. If you read and trust the code or trust the companies which audited the code, then nothing nefarious will happen. Scams can be detected easily if you read the source code or check if the software has been audited by a trustworthy company (or even easier, look for interest rates which are too good to be true. if it's below 10% it's probably legit, above 10% and it's probably a scam, so do some due diligence into the source code and/or audits.). Furthermore, you can get insurance now on your deposits. If you can earn 5% interest on a 4th storey money lego but you want to hedge the chance of collapse, you can pay 1-2% of the interest to another app which will bail you out in the event of an exploit.\n\n>At the end of the day, what has been created is more financial tools previously not possible, built by many less people than the large numbers of paper pushing bankers and is more transparent and resistant to embezzlement (if you do your due diligence) because everything is open source. A great example of this is Uniswap. Uniswap lets you swap one cryptoasset for another instantly (I won't bore you with the innovation which made this possible, if you're curious, Google \"automated market maker\"). Uniswap V1 was created by one man. Three years later, Uniswap's 10 man team has just hit the enormous milestone of ***$1 trillion*** (yes, trillion) dollars worth of trading volume. A fucking 10 man team in just 4 years. That's how efficient this software is. A man with an idea for a new type of asset exchange creates a few hundred lines of code which allow people to swap assets instantly and in 4 years, this software trades 5% of what the New York stock exchange traded from its inception in over 200 years from 1792 to 2011. And that's only one of hundreds of DeFi apps. And it's growing exponentially. And there's no shortage of new ideas yet to be built.\n\n>**TL;DR:** You couldn't build one financial app on top of another one before crypto. This creates endless new possibilites for ideas which couldn't previously be built. These apps can all interact with each other instantly and trade billions of dollars a day with no employees needed to keep the system running.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><ul>\n<li><p>Someone in AskReddit says &quot;what&#39;s a sign of low intelligence?&quot;</p></li>\n<li><p>Someone else answers &quot;Making strong opinions on topics you don&#39;t understand.&quot;</p></li>\n<li><p>Someone says they don&#39;t talk about their field of expertise on Reddit anymore outside of its specific sub because they get downvoted for telling the truth.</p></li>\n<li><p>I say &quot;yeah that&#39;s crypto.

What do we actually mean by that? How is this different than data stored on Ethereum blockchain to date?** (vitalik answers) (27:30)\n\n**TLDR:** Data availibility guarantees that the data on the Ethereum Blockchains and in shards passed through a process where anyone can download it. Vitalik highlights this by comparing ZK Rollups to Validiums, with the key difference being that in ZK rollups the inputs (state deltas) are on chain vs. in Validiums only proofs are on chain. He then explains how the Beacon chain will be a series of hashes (KCG commitments) that point to shards, and L2\u2019s will leverage this to bring scalability. DankSharding is just providing this guarantee around data availiblity rather than trying to actually shard EVM execution for now.\n\n- What the difference between us (ETH) and IPFS\n    - IPFS - If enough people care the data is broadcasted and anyone can download it\n        - Resource: [What is IPFS?](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/)\n    - ETH - provides a hard consensus on the question of a whether or not a piece of data with a particular hash or paticular commitment IS available\n        - Available - Did the data go through this process where anyone who needed the data could\u2019ve downloaded it\n    - The key difference is with a malicious publisher\n        - On IPFS a malicious actor can corrupt this basically, can\u2019t ensure that the data was DEFINITELY published to everyone, ETH gives a binary consensus\n    - Why does this matters - layer 2 protocols\n        - L2 protocols depend on data not downloaded by anyone, but downloadable by anyone\n        - Example - ZK rollup\n            - You have a sequencer\n            - Sequencer accepts transactions\n            - Sequencer publishes blocks\n            - Blocks: state deltas proofs\n            - State deltas maintain states\n            - ZK Rollup vs Validium:\n            - In ZK rollup state deltas (or inputs) are stored on chain while in Validiums only proofs are on chain, everything else off chain\n            - What are Validiums\n            - ZK Starks prevent anything invalid from coming in, in both Validiums and ZK Rollups\n            - ZK Rollups prevents what if sequencer disappears or becomes malicious or inactive?\n            - Resource: [Validium vs. ZK Rollup](https://blog.matter-labs.io/zkrollup-vs-validium-starkex-5614e38bc263)\n            - Resource: Relevant [Twitter thread from Matter Labs (retweeted by Vitalik) on Validiums vs. ZK Rollups](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1269274510710243330?lang=en)\n            - Validiums can basically extort in the worst case and freeze assets, can\u2019t happen on a ZK Rollup because state deltas and inputs are on chain\n            - Basically key difference is the data on chain or off chain?\n        - Proto dank sharding and eventually danksharding\n            - Try to zero in on a providing a platform that provides exactly that capability - rebuilding state in the case of sequencer going down or not having access to off chain data\n            - The beacon chain will ONLY contain hashes of data\n                - Hashes = KCG commitments\n                - Resource: [Dankrad on KCG commitments](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html) (very technical)\n            - Full data will exist in shards\n            - Hashes point to data on shards basically\n            - Provides a way that data HAS been published without everyone storing it\n            - Shards will not have to store the data forever\n                - 30 days \u2192 3 months\n                - Anyone can download the data? But who ? Where?

He then explains how the Beacon chain will be a series of hashes (KCG commitments) that point to shards, and L2\u2019s will leverage this to bring scalability.

I also plan several days of Hawaii facts around the attack on Pearl Harbor around D-Day, June 6, as sort of bookend pivotal moments for American involvement in the war; the beginning of U.S. direct engagement with Pearl Harbor and the beginning of the end in Europe.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-30 10:47:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iakgy92","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v0sn6p","parent_id":"t3_v0sn6p","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SeaMonkey82","body":"> The first known use was as an altar where Hawaiians offered human sacrifices to pagan gods and the killed violators of the many taboos\n\nBEARS FOR THE ETH GOD","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The first known use was as an altar where Hawaiians offered human sacrifices to pagan gods and the killed violators of the many taboos</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>BEARS FOR THE ETH GOD</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-30 11:14:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iakkmln","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v0sn6p","parent_id":"t1_iakgy92","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Not gonna lie, I'm very new to crypto and I pretty much bought ETH after listening to 3 Arrows Capital when Su Zhu said there won't be any more big drawdowns, only corrections, and we're entering an only-up supercycle. \n\nHaving seen a 60% decline and all their theories being proven absolutely wrong (not to mention the Ethereum backstabbing they did a few months ago), to be honest, I was super disappointed and left questioning advice from authority figures esp. related to price action.

However, their option prices are comparable to Deribit (no mispricing there) but the liquidity is insanely bad - a large trade can slippage doubling the price or more. But if it had better liquidity then we would really be getting somewhere. </p>\n\n<p>Also, is it built on top of Synthetix or something? Why do they use sUSD on Lyra as the default stablecoin?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-30 12:18:50","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-30 13:41:12","id":"iaksylj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v0sn6p","parent_id":"t3_v0sn6p","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Drew41","body":"Dopex on Arbitrum or Lyra on Optimism","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Dopex on Arbitrum or Lyra on Optimism</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-30 12:40:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iakvq6r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v0sn6p","parent_id":"t1_iaksylj","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"Thank you will check it ou!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you will check it ou!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-30 13:14:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ial01s5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v0sn6p","parent_id":"t1_iakvq6r","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/igorkn","body":"Lyra finance on optimism?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Lyra finance on optimism?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-30 12:39:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iakvjur","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v0sn6p","parent_id":"t1_iaksylj","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"Thanks man - good reason for me to finally get to Optimism!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks man - good reason for me to finally get to Optimism!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-30 13:14:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ial02rc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v0sn6p","parent_id":"t1_iakvjur","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Drew41","body":"Regarding your edit, Dopex does have options selling/writing.
