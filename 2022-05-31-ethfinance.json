He and I have been collaborating on this and we think it's ready for your viewing pleasure.  \n\nThe idea behind this dashboard is to explore the on-chain habits of the wonderful community we have here/in EVMavericks.  This is probably the best data we have so far on how people here are *actually using* the ethereum blockchain! \n\nWe looked at staking. How many people are participating in various forms, whether it be solo staking, rocketpool node operating, lido, etc? Plus I made a graph which is fun.  \n\nLayer 2 participation is strong. You can see how many people were using zksync, hop, arbitrum, optimism, polygon, sand starknet.  Lots lots of early L2 users in here. No surprise but also really cool to see.\n\nPublic goods support. The community has a heart too! It's not all about making money. We have Gitcoin donators and ukraine donators and pooly minters and constitutionDAO contributors. \n\nPlenty of Defi and NFT users as well.  Look at that ENS number!  Wow.  That one shocked me a bit. Sooo high. Very impressed. \n\nAND these are all minimum counts because community members may have minted to fresh wallets, use multiple wallets, etc. Which makes these numbers all the more impressive as only a portion of the true usage.   \n\nI hope this is something everybody here finds interesting because it's about us! \n\n----------------- Sentiment + shilling below this point -----------------\n\nI also wanted to take a second to just get excited about collaborating together with another awesome community member u/mtitus6 (who by the way built the first EVMavericks dune dashboard entirely himself and it's awesome and [you should go here](https://dune.com/mtitus6/EVMavericks) and star both dashboards. It makes a big difference!) to build something.  \n \nThis is the bear market before what I think will be a generational explosion in this space.

He and I have been collaborating on this and we think it&#39;s ready for your viewing pleasure.  </p>\n\n<p>The idea behind this dashboard is to explore the on-chain habits of the wonderful community we have here/in EVMavericks.  This is probably the best data we have so far on how people here are <em>actually using</em> the ethereum blockchain! </p>\n\n<p>We looked at staking. How many people are participating in various forms, whether it be solo staking, rocketpool node operating, lido, etc? Plus I made a graph which is fun.  </p>\n\n<p>Layer 2 participation is strong. You can see how many people were using zksync, hop, arbitrum, optimism, polygon, sand starknet.  Lots lots of early L2 users in here. No surprise but also really cool to see.</p>\n\n<p>Public goods support. The community has a heart too! It&#39;s not all about making money. We have Gitcoin donators and ukraine donators and pooly minters and constitutionDAO contributors. </p>\n\n<p>Plenty of Defi and NFT users as well.  Look at that ENS number!  Wow.  That one shocked me a bit. Sooo high. Very impressed. </p>\n\n<p>AND these are all minimum counts because community members may have minted to fresh wallets, use multiple wallets, etc. Which makes these numbers all the more impressive as only a portion of the true usage.   </p>\n\n<p>I hope this is something everybody here finds interesting because it&#39;s about us! </p>\n\n<p>----------------- Sentiment + shilling below this point -----------------</p>\n\n<p>I also wanted to take a second to just get excited about collaborating together with another awesome community member <a href=\"/u/mtitus6\">u/mtitus6</a> (who by the way built the first EVMavericks dune dashboard entirely himself and it&#39;s awesome and <a href=\"https://dune.com/mtitus6/EVMavericks\">you should go here</a> and star both dashboards.

Validators sandwich attack users or take advantage of opportunities that are seen as antisocial but do not involve violation of state or consensus norms (Tangent: The line between honest and dishonest is pretty subjective here. Even the idea of a perfectly honest transaction ordering is subjective but that\u2019s a different topic). </li>\n<li>  Private transaction ordering and censorship.  Private transaction pooling is okay in its current state, but MEV operators and attacking nodes hiding private transactions from defending nodes could be a problem in my mind that makes \u201chonest\u201d staking economically unsustainable.</li>\n<li>  Block timing attacks. Attacking nodes delay block proposal to chain together more blocks for the attacking pool, making it more difficult for defending nodes to propose blocks in correct slot or to follow correct chain weight based on voting. </li>\n<li>  Multi-block reorgs:  attacking nodes coordinate to follow and vote for a reordered set of blocks, essentially allowing them to reorganize all of the transactions. Defending pools would have hard time overcoming this due to proposer selection and vote weighting not being in their favor. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The dishonest behaviors here would probably not destroy the entire chain. The net value of the protocol might decrease, but the rent extracted by the attacking pool is sizable enough to warrant the dishonest behavior.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-31 06:21:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ianripy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v1ikyu","parent_id":"t1_iano85y","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LiterallyTrolling","body":"Aren\u2019t all of these attacks possible under PoW today?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Aren\u2019t all of these attacks possible under PoW today?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-31 08:45:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iaoah9f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v1ikyu","parent_id":"t1_ianripy","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheFightingTemeraire","body":"Some but not all. miners aren\u2019t beholden to on-chain governance and block production under PoW is different.

You're incorrect on multiple fronts but you post confidently. Firstly, CRV's only \"real value\" is not that you can sell it as a yield. veCRV holders are entitled to the profits Curve makes, and these profits are paid in a stablecoin (3CRV) . \\*That\\* is it's real value.
