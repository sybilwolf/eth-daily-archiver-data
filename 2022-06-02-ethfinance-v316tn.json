It may be true, I don't really know. I know that every day I'm feeling more and more like going dark because the tide is turning against us and I'm running out of energy. [Danny](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1524044527828303872) and [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1525301234516652032) have spoken out against Lido's increasing governance of the Ethereum beacon chain validator pool, currently at [32.39%](https://www.rated.network/) with some recent decrease due to side effects of the Terra/Luna meltdown. Danny recently published an article regarding the [dangers of liquid staking derivitives](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1531383030786314240) where he articulated many of the risks associated with allowing one governance entity to control more than 33% of the validator set. I strongly encourage you to read this article closely.\n\nIn a perfect world, this kind of attention from Danny and Vitalik would cause a rational liquid staking provider to take steps to prevent further growth, but this isn't happening. Lido [appears to be doubling down](https://research.lido.fi/t/should-lido-on-ethereum-be-limited-to-some-fixed-of-stake/2225) on their growth plan and is planning to onboard [additional operators](https://i.ibb.co/sC2ZLCM/new-operators.png) many of whom are client implementation teams. \n\nSomeone's napkin math (that I can't find right now) suggested that Lido operators earn 600 Eth per year in rewards for running nodes. Let's ignore the fact that those rewards ought to be going to individuals, and focus instead on the impact of those rewards for operators. When Lido operators are also beacon chain implementers it puts the network in a very precarious position: The EF pay for implementation isn't as great as the Lido pay for being an operator, so it creates a conflict of interest that is likely to cause implementers to put the needs of Lido above the beacon chain.\n\nThis is classic capture, and it's the kind of thing that happens right in front of our eyes. I've heard Lido operators say that the best way for them to effect positive change in Lido is to do so as part of the system rather than fighting from the outside. I call this \"capture speak\", what it translates to is, \"I can't turn down that really sweet paycheck.\" I believe the correct course for operators is to leave, or threaten to leave unless Lido corrects its course. No operator should willingly participate in network capture.\n\nI don't want to spread FUD, but Lido incentives are running deep through our ecosystem right now, and unless something changes Lido will probably find itself operating more than 33% of the validator set when their peg is re-established and deposits flow in again. \n\nThere's a counter-argument that says, \"We can't really do anything to offset Lido until withdrawals are enabled.\" I strongly disagree with this statement. It's true that Lido will continue to operate the validators they have, but the community can still exit their position through the liquidity token and take that Ether to pretty much ANY entity that doesn't control 33% of the infrastructure. If 1/2 of the lido liquidity exited and staked with Rocket Pool it would have a few positive effects: It would increase decentralization on the network, and it would further de-peg steth which will prevent further minting of steth.\n\nLido has continually denied being a governance layer, but the 600 Ether (?) incentives they're paying to their operators are evidence of governance at work. The fact that Lido operators will jump through hoops to keep those rewards - even if it supports an attacker on the chain - is bad for all of us.\n\nOn top of all of this are hundreds of voices from people who are my friends telling me that I'm blowing it out of proportion, that Lido would never harm the network, and that if Lido didn't capture the network someone else would. Not to mention the idea that chains are somehow purely capitalistic and we should never ask people to \"do the right thing\" if it isn't forced by financial incentives. I don't buy any of this, but I'm just one person. In the [Soulbound paper](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=589112090009124099127002093122074064031038028079005001126106083005088008068027072031100048097039026028033108099064095026094126017001002076092009082110125115085114080054048004021018118006006064095124091028011115071016003084002068064095000088065010117125&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE) there's a line that says,\n\n> even if not a Sybil attack\u2014such a vote\nis more likely to be a group of Souls who are making the same error in judgment or who share the same bias,\nand so should reasonably be weighted less than a vote with the same numerical level of support but from a\nmore diverse base of participants.\n\nthis reminds me that my voice may be wrong. That we need to hear diverse voices and give credibility to different viewpoints where it's due. With this, I acknowledge that asking Lido to cap its validator set may not be the best course of action, I also agree with Vitalik's price-gouging suggestion; but the one point I can't back down from is that allowing any entity to exceed 33% of the validator set is a manifestation of network capture and it's contrary to every reason that I'm a participant in Ethereum.\n\nSo.. one way or another I'm going to be done with this soon. This isn't my war, I'm not a fighter. My true inclination is to get along with everyone and have a lot of healthy network participants. I recognize that greed is a natural part of human nature, but I still believe that enough people with aligned incentives can work together to build a better world for everyone. I want that to be on the Ethereum beacon chain.\n\n**update June 3:** I'm no longer comfortable with these words, they make me feel anxious.

My reason is because I use a lot of DeFi because it is genuinely useful. Most of my DeFi use isn&#39;t to yield farm or utilise liquidity incentive programmes. Uniswap, Gitcoin, Pool Together, NFTs like EVMs and BeachBums, Maker, RocketPool, ENS. These are all apps I have used due to the utility they offer. Sure, I have used apps I wouldn&#39;t have used if it weren&#39;t for airdrop hunting opportunities such as Pika Protocol and some of the L2s plus their bridges, but that&#39;s not the majority of my on-chain activity in terms of fees paid to the L1.</p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, these incentive systems are more about infighting to outcompete competing protocols. Sure, it may double, triple or even quadruple activity in the short term in some cases but it&#39;s not entirely fake demand. The exponential growth in the use of these platforms will offset the loss of temporary liquidity paid for by these programmes in my opinion.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-02 18:56:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iazjo3m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v316tn","parent_id":"t1_iazbohg","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"> Uniswap, Gitcoin, Pool Together, NFTs like EVMs and BeachBums, Maker, RocketPool, ENS.\n\nSpeculation on tokens, niche public good donations, gambling, speculation, Maker is dope, onetime set up fees for infrastructure, speculation\n\nThere are not likely to be the applications that are going to onboard the next billion people though, your usage as a crypto native who interacts with Ethereum as a hobby is not generalizable to your average person.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Uniswap, Gitcoin, Pool Together, NFTs like EVMs and BeachBums, Maker, RocketPool, ENS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Speculation on tokens, niche public good donations, gambling, speculation, Maker is dope, onetime set up fees for infrastructure, speculation</p>\n\n<p>There are not likely to be the applications that are going to onboard the next billion people though, your usage as a crypto native who interacts with Ethereum as a hobby is not generalizable to your average person.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-02 19:28:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iaznpra","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v316tn","parent_id":"t1_iazjo3m","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"> Speculation on tokens (Uniswap)\n\nActually, most of my use of Uniswap has been profit taking into stablecoins and then subsequent sales of those into my bank account for spending.\n\n>niche public good donations (Gitcoin)\n\nStill a use case.
