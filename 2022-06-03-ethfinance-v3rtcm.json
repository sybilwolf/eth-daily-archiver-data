Along with his ukulele playing and incorporation of other genres, such as jazz and reggae, IZ remains influential in Hawaiian music, and is seen by many as the best Hawaiian musician of all time.\n\nAfter performing and recording with Makaha Sons of Ni\u02bbihau for about 15 years, IZ released his first solo album in 1991. He achieved commercial success outside Hawaii when his album Facing Future was released in 1993. His medley of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\" was released on his albums Ka \u02bbAno\u02bbi and Facing Future, and was subsequently featured in several films, television programs and television commercials.\n\nFacing Future became Hawaii's first certified platinum album, selling more than a million CDs in the United States. In 2021, the song \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\" was inducted into the National Recording Registry as one of 600 recordings preserved in the Library of Congress because they are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.\n\nIn 1988, a friend of IZ's called a Honolulu recording studio owned by Milan Bertosa at 3 a.m. with a request that IZ be allowed to come in to make a recording. Bertosa was about to shut down, but told the friend that IZ could come if he was able to make it within 15 minutes. In a 2011 interview, Bertosa recalled, \"In walks the largest human being I had seen in my life. Israel was probably like 500 pounds. And the first thing at hand is to find something for him to sit on.\" A security guard gave IZ a large steel chair. \"Then I put up some microphones, do a quick sound check, roll tape, and the first thing he does is 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow.' He played and sang, one take, and it was over.\" This recording would not be released until 1993 as a last-minute addition.\n\nIZ suffered from obesity throughout his life, at one point weighing 757 pounds (343 kilograms) while standing 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 meters) tall. He endured several hospitalizations because of his weight. With chronic medical problems including respiratory and cardiac issues, he died at the age of 38 on June 26, 1997, from respiratory failure.\n\nOn July 10, 1997, the Hawaiian flag flew at half-staff for Kamakawiwo\u02bbole's funeral. His koa wood casket lay at the state capitol building in Honolulu, making him the third person (and the only non-government official) to be so honored. Approximately 10,000 people attended his funeral. Thousands of fans gathered as his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean at M\u0101kua Beach on July 12, 1997.

Every attempt to make Heaven on Earth has succeeded quite spectacularly in making Hell on Earth. While I do get the excitement around Ethereum's potential, let's be realistic: no technology can fix the problem in the human heart. We are all, alas, broken from birth.\n\nBut why am I interested in Ethereum? Aside from KOOL TEK, which is admittedly a good reason to learn about anything, it's pretty simple: economic justice.\n\nThe Book of Amos is unusual among the minor prophets because it begins with excoriating other nations for their horrible sins. When the LORD comes to Israel, he has two major complaints:\n\n1. Idolatry\n2. Economic injustice.\n\nHere's a representative sample:\n\n>4 Hear this, you who trample on the needy\r  \nand bring the poor of the land to an end,\r  \n5 saying, \u201cWhen will the new moon be over,\r  \nthat we may sell grain?\r  \nAnd the Sabbath,\r  \nthat we may offer wheat for sale,\r  \nthat we may make the ephah small and the shekel great\r  \nand deal deceitfully with false balances,\r  \n6 that we may buy the poor for silver\r  \nand the needy for a pair of sandals\r  \nand sell the chaff of the wheat?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n7 The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:\r  \n\u201cSurely I will never forget any of their deeds.\r  \n8 Shall not the land tremble on this account,\r  \nand everyone mourn who dwells in it,\r  \nand all of it rise like the Nile,\r  \nand be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n9 \u201cAnd on that day,\u201d declares the Lord GOD,\r  \n\u201cI will make the sun go down at noon\r  \nand darken the earth in broad daylight.\r  \n10 I will turn your feasts into mourning\r  \nand all your songs into lamentation;\r  \nI will bring sackcloth on every waist\r  \nand baldness on every head;\r  \nI will make it like the mourning for an only son\r  \nand the end of it like a bitter day.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying that God will smite America/the world/whomever if things don't change. He might. I don't know. I'm not God. But be honest: are you here just for the KOOL TEK, the financial rollercoaster ride, or the potential to fix some coordination problems? Or are you, too, here because you're sick of the current broken system and want some change?\n\nFor the crypto community's faults (to which anyone who saw the LUNA disaster can attest), we have genuinely created an alternate financial system which, if not necessarily fairer, has at least the potential to be fairer. Sandwich attacks aside, anyone using Uniswap gets the same deal, whale and plankton alike. DAOs, at their best, reinvent the corporation, blurring the edges between participant and investor. Yes, there are imposters, but an artist can sell NFTs directly to the public. (I long for the day some NFT-based platform kicks Amazon's posterior and we authors can stop putting up with their crap.) I'm not even going to get into non-usurious financing, because that's a whole comment by itself. There is no difference in Ethereum's eyes between one account and another, only what gas a transaction will pay for.\n\nWill Ethereum change the world? I hope so. I don't think it's the most important thing going on in the world. The most important thing you can do is go to Mass, but short that, head to the local street corner and talk to a homeless person. But in terms of technology, we finally have something that puts Big Tech, Big Money, you, I, and that homeless person all on a mostly even playing field.\n\nWill God act if we don't? Again, I don't know. The Old Testament, wishing to emphasize God's sovereignty as the Supreme Being and not one God among many, talks about God directly acting in all circumstances and is hazy on indirect causation. Also from Amos, \"Does evil befall a city, / unless the LORD has done it?\" But what can you expect? Biblical Hebrew has \\~900 words, most of which have several meanings. Rather, modern Jews and Christians alike emphasize God's role in stepping back and allowing people to reap what they sow.\n\nAs we saw a few weeks ago. (Does evil befall a blockchain, / unless the LORD has done it?)\n\nWere those who invested in LUNA any worse sinners (financially speaking) than the rest of the crypto community? I doubt it. But vengeance, direct or indirect, tends to have collateral damage. The crypto community suffered for LUNA, innocent or not, and with economic woe on the horizon we will all be suffering soon.\n\nWe don't know when Amos was preaching, other than in the reign of Jeroboam II. Jeroboam II's reign was marked with material prosperity, and even success in war. But his death was the end of his dynasty, and after that it hit the fan. Within the lifetime of Amos's hearers the nation had fallen. False weights and measures might not be our issue per se (although goodness knows $100 doesn't buy what it used to at the grocery store) but the LORD is the same from age to age. We don't have a prophet to warn of us the future.\n\nBut it's still worth thinking about, isn't it?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Time for a completely different perspective.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not a techno-utopian.

When the LORD comes to Israel, he has two major complaints:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Idolatry</li>\n<li>Economic injustice.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a representative sample:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>4 Hear this, you who trample on the needy</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and bring the poor of the land to an end,</p>\n\n<p>5 saying, \u201cWhen will the new moon be over,</p>\n\n<p>that we may sell grain?</p>\n\n<p>And the Sabbath,</p>\n\n<p>that we may offer wheat for sale,</p>\n\n<p>that we may make the ephah small and the shekel great</p>\n\n<p>and deal deceitfully with false balances,</p>\n\n<p>6 that we may buy the poor for silver</p>\n\n<p>and the needy for a pair of sandals</p>\n\n<p>and sell the chaff of the wheat?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>7 The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSurely I will never forget any of their deeds.</p>\n\n<p>8 Shall not the land tremble on this account,</p>\n\n<p>and everyone mourn who dwells in it,</p>\n\n<p>and all of it rise like the Nile,</p>\n\n<p>and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>9 \u201cAnd on that day,\u201d declares the Lord GOD,</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI will make the sun go down at noon</p>\n\n<p>and darken the earth in broad daylight.</p>\n\n<p>10 I will turn your feasts into mourning</p>\n\n<p>and all your songs into lamentation;</p>\n\n<p>I will bring sackcloth on every waist</p>\n\n<p>and baldness on every head;</p>\n\n<p>I will make it like the mourning for an only son</p>\n\n<p>and the end of it like a bitter day.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not saying that God will smite America/the world/whomever if things don&#39;t change. He might. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not God. But be honest: are you here just for the KOOL TEK, the financial rollercoaster ride, or the potential to fix some coordination problems? Or are you, too, here because you&#39;re sick of the current broken system and want some change?</p>\n\n<p>For the crypto community&#39;s faults (to which anyone who saw the LUNA disaster can attest), we have genuinely created an alternate financial system which, if not necessarily fairer, has at least the potential to be fairer. Sandwich attacks aside, anyone using Uniswap gets the same deal, whale and plankton alike. DAOs, at their best, reinvent the corporation, blurring the edges between participant and investor. Yes, there are imposters, but an artist can sell NFTs directly to the public. (I long for the day some NFT-based platform kicks Amazon&#39;s posterior and we authors can stop putting up with their crap.) I&#39;m not even going to get into non-usurious financing, because that&#39;s a whole comment by itself. There is no difference in Ethereum&#39;s eyes between one account and another, only what gas a transaction will pay for.</p>\n\n<p>Will Ethereum change the world? I hope so. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the most important thing going on in the world. The most important thing you can do is go to Mass, but short that, head to the local street corner and talk to a homeless person. But in terms of technology, we finally have something that puts Big Tech, Big Money, you, I, and that homeless person all on a mostly even playing field.</p>\n\n<p>Will God act if we don&#39;t? Again, I don&#39;t know. The Old Testament, wishing to emphasize God&#39;s sovereignty as the Supreme Being and not one God among many, talks about God directly acting in all circumstances and is hazy on indirect causation. Also from Amos, &quot;Does evil befall a city, / unless the LORD has done it?&quot; But what can you expect? Biblical Hebrew has ~900 words, most of which have several meanings. Rather, modern Jews and Christians alike emphasize God&#39;s role in stepping back and allowing people to reap what they sow.</p>\n\n<p>As we saw a few weeks ago. (Does evil befall a blockchain, / unless the LORD has done it?)</p>\n\n<p>Were those who invested in LUNA any worse sinners (financially speaking) than the rest of the crypto community? I doubt it. But vengeance, direct or indirect, tends to have collateral damage. The crypto community suffered for LUNA, innocent or not, and with economic woe on the horizon we will all be suffering soon.</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t know when Amos was preaching, other than in the reign of Jeroboam II. Jeroboam II&#39;s reign was marked with material prosperity, and even success in war. But his death was the end of his dynasty, and after that it hit the fan. Within the lifetime of Amos&#39;s hearers the nation had fallen. False weights and measures might not be our issue per se (although goodness knows $100 doesn&#39;t buy what it used to at the grocery store) but the LORD is the same from age to age. We don&#39;t have a prophet to warn of us the future.</p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s still worth thinking about, isn&#39;t it?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-03 05:27:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ib127sv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v3rtcm","parent_id":"t3_v3rtcm","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"I think this is a first for me to see someone unpack a prophet from the Bible eloquently with crypto in mind.
