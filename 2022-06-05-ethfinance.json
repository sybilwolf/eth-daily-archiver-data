They don&#39;t hold any positions in crypto, so they don&#39;t benefit financially if the price of Bitcoin drops. Doing otherwise is a form of denial that isn&#39;t so far removed from climate change denial tactics used by oil companies and their ilk.</p>\n\n<p>For me, the argument that it&#39;s in it&#39;s infancy is a flawed and misguided way to view it. to take that view and simply allow things to carry on as they are is likely to turn out bad for everyone as it has for so many technologies/developments. We don&#39;t really have the luxury of doing that any longer. Which is one reason why if someone brings up crypto/NFTs around me now, I point out the negative effects they have compared to a few years ago when I would have been talking about the possibilities they provide.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-06 10:42:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibe2dlo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v5694r","parent_id":"t1_ibd4say","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/SuddenMind","body":"He\u2019s simply ngmi","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>He\u2019s simply ngmi</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-06 20:44:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibg6fq9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v5694r","parent_id":"t1_ibbbts7","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Set1Less","body":"Still amazed that Ray Dalio told all his millions of followers in Feb that cash is a useless asset.. right at the time when holding cash and preserving capital is the best trade most would have made","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Still amazed that Ray Dalio told all his millions of followers in Feb that cash is a useless asset.. right at the time when holding cash and preserving capital is the best trade most would have made</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-05 05:54:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ib8xlui","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v5694r","parent_id":"t3_v5694r","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptobuddy_1712","body":"He recently said equities are much crappier.

At a $2K price, that is about $28 million a day. Coingecko states that the last 24 hour volume for ETH is $7.8 billion. So the $28 million that the miners are selling (lavishly assuming they sell everything), that&#39;s only 0.35% of daily traded ETH that&#39;s will no longer be available (assuming 0% inflation after merge) .

Get yer [NFTs](https://hodlercon.com/beachbums/) if you haven't already. \u2014\n\nToday we hear about someone who knew how to buy when blood was in the streets \u2014 Honolulu businesswoman, real estate investor, author and prostitute Jean O'Hara. O'Hara had been working as a prostitute around the U.S. mainland in the 1930s and probably was working in a high-class brothel in San Francisco when she was recruited to work in Honolulu around 1938.\n\nWhen Honolulu madams needed new prostitutes, they sent a \"mail order\" to agents, usually in San Francisco, to recruit them and arrange transport to Honolulu. The steamers were met by a detective, as prostitution was legal in Hawaii at the time and regulated by a vice squad. O'Hara and the other women were taken to the Blaisdell Hotel on Fort Street, explained the \"10 commandments\" for prostitutes and told any infraction would lead to them being removed from the islands. The rules included prohibitions on dating, going to high-visibility beaches and living outside the red-light district. The women were then taken to the police station, where they were fingerprinted and photographed. From there she was taken to the brothel where she was to work on Hotel Street.\n\nAfter a few months she had saved a considerable sum. She decided to live outside the red-light district and rented a house near Waikiki Beach with her friend Betty. After the vice squad objected, the women moved to the Pacific Heights area. After the vice squad again objected, O'Hara and Betty worked in brothels on Kauai and then Maui before returning to Honolulu in 1939.\r  \n\r  \nOn her return, a police officer beat O'Hara, breaking her nose, jaw and ribs, and charged her with assault and battery on a police office by the officer concerned. She in turn filed a case against the officer and the chief of police. The resulting publicity resulted in the charges being dropped. This successful standing up to the vice squad was the start of the squad losing its hold over the red-light district.\r  \n\r  \nWith some money behind her, O'Hara set herself up as a madam. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, people were fearful of further bombings and invasion. People were keen to sell their property and O'Hara bought up several properties which subsequently made her very wealthy. Immediately after the attack, many of the brothels were turned over to quarters for the wounded. With the brothels occupied and the authorities distracted, the prostitutes started working outside the district. O'Hara started working from the luxury Moana Hotel with two other women. \n\nFollowing complaints about noise, O'Hara was arrested under the new May Act of 1941, which outlawed prostitution near U.S. military installations and production facilities. As the military had now taken control of the red-light district and prostitution, she was tried by a military court and sentenced to six months. \r  \n\r  \nOn her release she returned to her brothel on Hotel Street. By this time the military had set a fixed price for prostitute's services. O'Hara is credited with inventing the \"bull pen\" system where a single prostitute would work three rooms in rotation: In one room a man would be undressing, in a second room the prostitute would be having sex, and in the third room the man would be dressing. With price controls circumventing the laws of supply and demand, O'Hara's system sped up the process and allowed each prostitute to see many more \"johns\" every day.\n\nIn 1944, O'Hara published her memoirs as \"My Life as a Honolulu Prostitute\" available under its reprint title at [https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/36272/ohara\\_honoluluharlot\\_tiff.pdf](https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/36272/ohara_honoluluharlot_tiff.pdf).  The 1956 Jane Russell film \"The Revolt of Mamie Stover\" was based on O'Hara's life and shot in Hawaii. The full film is on YouTube at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMsk3NYN0b4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMsk3NYN0b4). This Redditor skimmed it and found it not very good beyond the setting, like pretty much any 1950s film.\n\nO'Hara wrote in her book: \"My decision to write this article can be attributed to those public-spirited people whose persistence in uncovering the evils of prostitution have made me see my duty. Public officials, who are violating their sworn duties, and citizens who are getting rich off the flesh mines of this city, are weak and corrupt. They should be exposed.\"\n\nShe lived another 29 years, dying in 1973.\n\nSources: Wikipedia and Brittney Bonser's senior thesis: [https://huichawaii.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bonser-Brittney-2019-AHSE-HUIC.pdf](https://huichawaii.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bonser-Brittney-2019-AHSE-HUIC.pdf)\n\nBonus fact: Venereal disease was a huge problem for the world's militaries at the time, with the U.S. losing 18,000 soldiers *a day* to such illnesses in World War I, reduced to 606 a day by the early 1940s due to better treatment and prevention.
