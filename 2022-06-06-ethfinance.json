First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with the Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and enabling Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson-Walsh Act erased any chance of victory. Third, to deliver a blow to America's ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific, battleships were chosen as the main targets, since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time. Finally, it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale such that the U.S. government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests and would seek a compromise peace with Japan.\n\nThe attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time.  The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft (including fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers) in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. Of the eight U.S. Navy battleships present, all were damaged, with four sunk. All but USS Arizona were later raised. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship and one minelayer. More than 180 U.S. aircraft were destroyed. 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed.\n\nThe attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater. Further losses compounded the alarming setback; over the course of seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off the coast of Malaya, causing Winston Churchill later to recollect \"In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters, Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked.\"\n\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were out to sea and untouched; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines \u2014 the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \"decisive battle\" that never happened.\n\n\\[I plan to cover the USS Arizona and Pearl Harbor National Memorial on Thursday or Friday.\\]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2014 11 days to Hodlercon \u2014</p>\n\n<p>Today as many look back on the Allied invasion of occupied France, we&#39;ll cover a pivotal attack that marked the United States&#39; entry into World War II combat, the attack on Pearl Harbor.

That is a very different picture than the idealized model people have for why these cryptocurrencies are secure.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>For Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research who was consulted on the research, this finding demonstrates how decentralization played a rhetorical rather than substantive role. \u201cAnd that rhetorical role was very powerful \u2014 it bound together this community, much as other myths have bound together other communities, like nations,\u201d Dr. Weyl said. But the myth and the promise, he said, were in tension with the reality that emerged. \u201cIt\u2019s just fascinatingly ironic, and also predictable, repeating the historical patterns it aspires to erase.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Lanier called it \u201cdecentralization theater.\u201d</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-06 19:28:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibfy0k1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v5v535","parent_id":"t3_v5v535","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-06 19:51:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibg0kgo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v5v535","parent_id":"t1_ibfy0k1","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Etereve","body":"People here understand that but many NYT readers and anyone without more than casual knowledge of crypto do not.

Like all examples of the arguments of the &quot;benefits&quot; of leaving Europe, one scarcely has to scratch the surface of those arguments to discover that there is no substance or specific (logical) reasoning behind them (just rhetorical soundbites).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-06 04:00:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibcqnpv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v5v535","parent_id":"t1_ibcj813","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/suburbiton","body":"That's not xenophobia that's legitimate supply and demand of labour issues","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s not xenophobia that&#39;s legitimate supply and demand of labour issues</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-06 04:07:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibcr6kc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v5v535","parent_id":"t1_ibcqnpv","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"Create whatever narrative you like, but it's very defintely xenophobia (some of these people are straigh up racist).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Create whatever narrative you like, but it&#39;s very defintely xenophobia (some of these people are straigh up racist).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-06 04:23:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibcsei4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v5v535","parent_id":"t1_ibcr6kc","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/suburbiton","body":"You created the narrative buddy.

The velocity of money really is different with PoS mechanics, [more inflation actually encourages more saving/hoarding](https://dataalways.substack.com/p/manipulating-the-velocity-of-money?s=r). \n\nBy design, Ether is also inherently inflationary. It's only deflationnary when it's undervalued relative to the current demand for blockspace, which means enough people are still willing to part with their ETH in exchange for whatever benefit they get out of whatever transaction they just did. If you think about it, Ethereum incentivizes people to spend their ETH, *even when deflationary*.\n\nThe typical goal of a fiat currency being inflationary is to encourage economic activity, but in the case of ETH the goal of its inflation is too secure the network with some security budget. When it's net inflationary, this security is paid by holders who have their coin diluted by issuing more to stakers (and anyone can become a staker, so if you don't like your wealth getting diluted, just stake! win/win/win for both you and the network and Ether's price). When it's deflationary, the security is paid by those using the blockchain since every holder now enjoys the opposite of coin dilution. On the long term we get near 0% inflation and a secure network backed by a well-oiled economy\n\n>Is there really a good reason why NFTs should be valued in ETH and not USD beyond the trustlessness of ETH?\n\nI mean trustlessness is a pretty big one. ETH is the only 100% objective asset internal to the on-chain economy, since Ethereum's protocol doesn't know what the heck a US dollar is, it just knows about Ether and how to enforce its scarcity and issuance. When you pair stuff with USDT, you're trusting Tether. If you pair it with DAI, you're trusting MakerDao's governance/collateral/oracles, etc. not to mention being pegged to the USD can also be problematic since you're now indirectly tying your on-chain assets to a currency controlled by a big external actor with (potentially) misaligned incentives. Not really that big of a problem since you can peg a stablecoin to anything, but the end result is you're still sacrificing objectivity. It's a meme that 1 ETH = 1 ETH, but in the ethereum economy that actually means something important!\n\nBut maybe the 1 ETH = 1 ETH crowd is too small to matter on the long run, and the majority of economic participants don't care. Can sacrificing some of this objectivity by using a different asset be worth it? I don't see why not if enough people are fine with it, and it just solidifies ETH's place at [the bottom of the flipped economy](https://i.imgur.com/9Jgsz6U.png), still acting as collateral in these \"permissionless reserve banks\" issuing other competing currencies with various monetary policies. Today it's all stablecoins, tomorrow it might evolve into something more flexible like RAI, and then some day we might not even need to keep the value of 1 USD in the loop at all by being able to analyze various on-chain activity to have automatic currency schedules designed to accomplish whichever goals we want them to accomplish.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more EIP1559 really is genius in being the glue that ties everything together: You need ETH to participate in this economy, which incentivizes it to be at least liquid enough for people/whales/institutions/rollups to acquire it, which lets anyone permissionlessly get more ETH and stake it and benefit from the built-in value accrual and/or use it as collateral everywhere and enjoy an ever growing economic bandwidth allowing to do more stuff, get more ETH, whatever, which contributes to even more economic activity that burns even more ETH.

The velocity of money really is different with PoS mechanics, <a href=\"https://dataalways.substack.com/p/manipulating-the-velocity-of-money?s=r\">more inflation actually encourages more saving/hoarding</a>. </p>\n\n<p>By design, Ether is also inherently inflationary. It&#39;s only deflationnary when it&#39;s undervalued relative to the current demand for blockspace, which means enough people are still willing to part with their ETH in exchange for whatever benefit they get out of whatever transaction they just did. If you think about it, Ethereum incentivizes people to spend their ETH, <em>even when deflationary</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The typical goal of a fiat currency being inflationary is to encourage economic activity, but in the case of ETH the goal of its inflation is too secure the network with some security budget. When it&#39;s net inflationary, this security is paid by holders who have their coin diluted by issuing more to stakers (and anyone can become a staker, so if you don&#39;t like your wealth getting diluted, just stake! win/win/win for both you and the network and Ether&#39;s price). When it&#39;s deflationary, the security is paid by those using the blockchain since every holder now enjoys the opposite of coin dilution. On the long term we get near 0% inflation and a secure network backed by a well-oiled economy</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is there really a good reason why NFTs should be valued in ETH and not USD beyond the trustlessness of ETH?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean trustlessness is a pretty big one. ETH is the only 100% objective asset internal to the on-chain economy, since Ethereum&#39;s protocol doesn&#39;t know what the heck a US dollar is, it just knows about Ether and how to enforce its scarcity and issuance. When you pair stuff with USDT, you&#39;re trusting Tether. If you pair it with DAI, you&#39;re trusting MakerDao&#39;s governance/collateral/oracles, etc. not to mention being pegged to the USD can also be problematic since you&#39;re now indirectly tying your on-chain assets to a currency controlled by a big external actor with (potentially) misaligned incentives. Not really that big of a problem since you can peg a stablecoin to anything, but the end result is you&#39;re still sacrificing objectivity. It&#39;s a meme that 1 ETH = 1 ETH, but in the ethereum economy that actually means something important!</p>\n\n<p>But maybe the 1 ETH = 1 ETH crowd is too small to matter on the long run, and the majority of economic participants don&#39;t care. Can sacrificing some of this objectivity by using a different asset be worth it? I don&#39;t see why not if enough people are fine with it, and it just solidifies ETH&#39;s place at <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/9Jgsz6U.png\">the bottom of the flipped economy</a>, still acting as collateral in these &quot;permissionless reserve banks&quot; issuing other competing currencies with various monetary policies.
