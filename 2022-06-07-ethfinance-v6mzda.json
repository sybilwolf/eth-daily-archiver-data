We really felt this shift around November or December of last year, with it accelerating each month. So each month it got a little easier to find people. 2022 Year over year sales were up a lot first quarter, and that slowed second quarter. We were really concerned about having an absolute monster summer, so we have kept staffing levels high. It\u2019s been an absolute luxury being able to do so after how hard 2020 and 2021 were. But now it\u2019s clear that summer will be up a little bit but nothing crazy, so we are able to continue hiring new people but to also lay off people who can\u2019t get their act together despite training. A year ago right now we were absolutely drowning, and it would get worse through October.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-07 12:48:27","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-06-07 13:03:10","id":"ibix3x2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v6mzda","parent_id":"t1_ibipiaf","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/usesbinkvideo","body":"Wow, very interesting figure, thank you for sharing. \n\nI wonder how they calculate \"quit rate\"? \n\nAlso interesting to see what happened the last time a large slide occurred (~Jan 2020).

Midway Atoll is among the leeward islands of the Hawaiian archipelago and the only of these islands not part of the state of Hawaii; it is administered as part of the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nAmerican forces defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy north of Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet. Military historian John Keegan called it \"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare,\" while naval historian Craig Symonds called it \"one of the most consequential naval engagements in world history, ranking alongside Salamis, Trafalgar, and Tsushima Strait, as both tactically decisive and strategically influential.\"\n\nLuring the American aircraft carriers into a trap and occupying Midway was part of an overall \"barrier\" strategy to extend Japan's defensive perimeter, in response to the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo. This operation was also considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii itself. The plan was undermined by faulty Japanese assumptions of the American reaction and poor initial dispositions. Most significantly, American cryptographers were able to determine the date and location of the planned attack, enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to prepare its own ambush.\n\nNot anticipating American carriers to be nearby, Vice Admiral Ch\u016bichi Nagumo had launched the first wave of aircraft to attack Midway Atoll from the carriers Akagi, S\u014dry\u016b, Kaga and Hiry\u016b. While the strike force was in the air, a separate scout reported a previously undetected sizeable American fleet to the east. Nagumo was in a quandary.  His opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or it would have to ditch into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never had an opportunity to position (\"spot\") their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch.\n\nThe few aircraft on the Japanese flight decks at the time of the attack were either defensive fighters or fighters being spotted to augment the combat air patrol. Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would have required at least 30 minutes. Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserves to battle without proper anti-ship armament, and likely without fighter escort. Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, and then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.\n\nAmerican aircraft already were en route to the Japanese carriers. Three American dive-bomber squadrons arrived almost simultaneously at the perfect time, locations and altitudes to attack. Most of the Japanese patrol was directing its attention to torpedo planes from Midway and was out of position; meanwhile, armed Japanese strike aircraft filled the hangar decks, fuel hoses snaked across the decks as refueling operations were hastily being completed, and the repeated change of ordnance meant that bombs and torpedoes were stacked around the hangars, rather than stowed safely in the magazines, making the Japanese carriers extraordinarily vulnerable.\n\nWithin six minutes, carriers S\u014dry\u016b and Kaga were ablaze from stem to stern, as fires spread through the ships. Akagi, having been struck by only one bomb, took longer to burn, but the resulting fires quickly expanded and soon proved impossible to extinguish; she too was eventually consumed by flames and had to be abandoned. As Nagumo began to grasp the enormity of what had happened, he appeared to have gone into a state of shock. Witnesses saw Nagumo standing near the ship's compass looking out at the flames on his flagship and two other carriers in a trance-like daze.\n\nFour Japanese and three American aircraft carriers participated in the battle. The four Japanese fleet carriers \u2014 part of the six-carrier force that had attacked Pearl Harbor \u2014 were sunk, as was a heavy cruiser. The U.S. lost the carrier Yorktown and the destroyer Hammann, while the carriers USS Enterprise and USS Hornet survived the battle fully intact. On the Japanese side, 3,057 men were killed; on the American side, 307.\n\nAfter Midway and the exhausting attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in materiel (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained pilots and maintenance crewmen) rapidly became insufficient to cope with mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial and training capabilities made losses far easier to replace.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2014 10 days until Hodlercon \u2014</p>\n\n<p>Today marks 80 years since the conclusion of the pivotal Battle of Midway, which was just six months after the crippling attack on Pearl Harbor.

What gives banks the right to create that money? As societies we never explicitly agreed on that anywhere that I'm aware of. It was never a decision that the public was involved in, it just came to be somehow and now most people think it's normal and couldn't be any other way.\n\nThe origin of fiat currency is private entities issuing it, not states or banks. Fiat currency was invented in Western China as IOUs that businesses gave out. Then the government got involved and abused the idea by printing too much, causing the first hyperinflation (that I'm aware of). And that's basically the start of centuries of abuse of what began as a clever idea to avoid heaving to deal with (heavy) metal coins. \n\nThe right to property is a human right. I see no reason why this should not include money itself. If we don't own our money, we're but slaves to those controlling it. People need to be free to chose what currencies they want to use and that should include private ones.

What gives banks the right to create that money? As societies we never explicitly agreed on that anywhere that I&#39;m aware of. It was never a decision that the public was involved in, it just came to be somehow and now most people think it&#39;s normal and couldn&#39;t be any other way.</p>\n\n<p>The origin of fiat currency is private entities issuing it, not states or banks. Fiat currency was invented in Western China as IOUs that businesses gave out. Then the government got involved and abused the idea by printing too much, causing the first hyperinflation (that I&#39;m aware of). And that&#39;s basically the start of centuries of abuse of what began as a clever idea to avoid heaving to deal with (heavy) metal coins. </p>\n\n<p>The right to property is a human right.

What do I do if we stall out at 3600? I think we are going down because of fed rate hikes, QT, and consumer inflation worries. So if we got to 3650 and stalled out, and these three factors are still around/relevant, and its less than 6 months then I would just wait. If we got to that level though and one or more of those factors was no longer around OR we are at 6 months then I would need to reassess my thesis or close the position.</p>\n\n<p>what do you think?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-07 08:56:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibi0hxf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v6mzda","parent_id":"t3_v6mzda","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ModeratelyTortoise","body":"This is why it\u2019s not an exact science, you always have to be on you toes making sure nothing about your core thesis has changed.
