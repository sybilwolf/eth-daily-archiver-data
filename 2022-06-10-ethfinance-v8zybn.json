Only nimble institutions like (relatively) smaller funds and family offices can swiftly buy crypto assets. Even if the drive is there for larger institutions, it takes a year or more just to get the paperwork in place and custody methods are a bit of a moving target. \n\n2.

My assumption is that we'll see a lot more rollups and rising L1 tx fees, but maybe that's wrong. So far at least, an increased L2 usage has not lead to a fall in L1 cost. Because the tx that are added are largely new tx that people simply wouldn't have made if it were prohibitively expensive, like the above example. And my presumption is that some conservative L1 users will stay on L1 until it becomes prohibitively expensive for them, simply because they can afford it and they don't want to deal with the added complexity/risk, however small. \n\nCurrently L1 fees are \"low\" only because usage is low because we're in a downcycle.

My assumption is that we&#39;ll see a lot more rollups and rising L1 tx fees, but maybe that&#39;s wrong. So far at least, an increased L2 usage has not lead to a fall in L1 cost. Because the tx that are added are largely new tx that people simply wouldn&#39;t have made if it were prohibitively expensive, like the above example. And my presumption is that some conservative L1 users will stay on L1 until it becomes prohibitively expensive for them, simply because they can afford it and they don&#39;t want to deal with the added complexity/risk, however small. </p>\n\n<p>Currently L1 fees are &quot;low&quot; only because usage is low because we&#39;re in a downcycle.

The dynamic fee will correspond to Ethereum gas fees, which vary based on network activity. Any crypto withdrawal from the Gemini platform that\u2019s not ETH or an ERC-20 token will instead incur a flat fee. The flat fees for non-Ethereum crypto withdrawals can be found here.\nNetwork fees\nThese fees are not intended to generate revenue for Gemini.

This one's a doozy because I found the story of endurance, grit, inhumanity, adventure and happenstantial influence on the future of the Hawaiian Islands fascinating.\n\nAround 1788 American Simon Metcalfe had sailed his 190-ton brig name Eleanora from New York to China on a trading voyage. While in China preparing to pick up tea for the return voyage, he heard about the possibility of bigger money trading sea otter furs from what would become British Columbia. He was advised to get a smaller ship to navigate the many fjords of the area and purchased a 33-foot (10-meter) schooner. He named it the Fair American and put his 18-year-old son, Thomas, in charge of its crew of four.\n\nThey left China intending to sail together to the Pacific Northwest, but shortly after departure  a storm separated the ships. Thomas Metcalfe decided to continue the journey in their small vessel \u2014 undecked and only 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide. His only navigational instrument was a compass, which would break on the way, and his only guide was a rough map made by James Cook a decade or so prior.\n\nThomas and crew sailed north along the Japanese archipelago, the Kuriles, and the Aleutian Islands for about a month and a half, then navigated the Pacific Northwest coast, trading along the way but never encountering his father's ship. The Fair American arrived at their destination at a fur-trading settlement just in time to get caught up in an international incident, the [Nootka Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootka_Crisis). \n\nHis father's Eleanora had arrived and the Metcalfes decided to rendezvous at Kealakekua Bay on the Big Island of Hawaii to spend the winter. But Spanish authorities seized the still 18- or 19-year-old Metcalfe, his crew and his ship; the Eleanora escaped capture and headed for Hawaii. The Fair American was sailed to Mexico, Thomas and crew were imprisoned for 10 days in Monterey Bay, but eventually they were released and sailed toward their rendezvous point.\n\nSimon Metcalfe and the Eleanora had arrived at Kealakekua Bay by January 1790 and met chief Kame\u02bbeiamoku, who traded with them. An unknown action by the chief offended Simon Metcalfe, who had him flogged, and Kame\u02bbeiamoku vowed revenge on whatever ship next came his way.\n\nThe Eleanora then sailed north to Maui to trade and resupply. One night a small boat was stolen and the night watchman was killed. Captain Metcalfe fired his cannons into the village, and captured a few Hawaiians who told him the boat was taken by people from the village of Olowalu on the southwest coast of west Maui.\n\nSimon sailed to Olowalu but found that boat had been broken up for its nails. Nails were treasured in ancient Hawaii, which lacked metal smelting technology. Feigning peaceful intent, Simon invited the Hawaiians to the Eleanora for trade while he had his cannon loaded with ball and shot. When many canoes had gathered at the ship Simon ordered a broadside fired at point-blank range, which blasted the canoes to pieces. About 100\u2013300 Hawaiian men, women and children were killed and a great many more wounded in what would become known as the Olowalu Massacre.\n\nThirty miles away and within maybe a few days, chief Kame\u02bbeiamoku encountered his next ship, which turned out to be the Fair American, captained by the son of the very person who had so offended the chief, although nobody was aware of that fact at the time. Kame\u02bbeiamoku's men easily captured the schooner. Thomas Metcalfe and all but one of his crew were killed. The only survivor was Isaac Davis. Kame\u02bbeiamoku appropriated the ship, its guns, ammunition and other valuable goods (just a decade into trading with Europeans, this materiel was extremely useful), as well as Isaac Davis himself.\n\nSimon Metcalfe sailed back to the Big Island, arriving a day after the capture of the Fair American and the death of his son. At Kealakekua Bay, Simon began what seemed to be friendly trade for provisions. When chief Kamehameha learned about the capture of the Fair American he prohibited further contact between the natives and the Eleanora. Simon sent his boatswain John Young ashore to investigate. Young was captured, and Metcalfe was puzzled by the sudden silence.\n\nHe waited two days for Young to return, firing guns in hope that the sound would guide Young back. Finally, sensing danger or becoming frustrated, Metcalfe left and set sail for China, not knowing that his son had been killed not far away. He never learned about the attack on the Fair American or the fate of his son. Simon and crew were killed in 1794 by the Haida people of Haida Gwaii (formerly Queen Charlotte Islands) in present-day British Columbia.\n\nJohn Young and Isaac Davis were instrumental in Kamehameha's military ventures and his eventual conquest and unification of the Hawaiian Islands. Young and Davis became respected translators and military advisors for Kamehameha. Their skill in gunnery, as well as the cannon from the Fair American, helped Kamehameha win many battles, including the Battle of Kepaniwai, later in 1790, where the forces of Maui were defeated. Young and Davis married members of the royal family, raised families and received valuable lands.\n\nSources: A variety of Wikipedia articles.\n\nBonus fact: The Metcalfe's rendezvous point, Kealakekua Bay, is where 12 years prior Hawaiians had [killed James Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_James_Cook), captain of the first Europeans to arrive in Hawaii. Cook's crew had similarly stolen from the Hawaiians and they from them, until Cook tried kidnapping a chief and the Hawaiians killed Cook on the shore, at a spot now marked with a monument near the settlement Captain Cook.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2014 Seven days until Hodlercon! \u2014</p>\n\n<p>War Week continues.

About 100\u2013300 Hawaiian men, women and children were killed and a great many more wounded in what would become known as the Olowalu Massacre.</p>\n\n<p>Thirty miles away and within maybe a few days, chief Kame\u02bbeiamoku encountered his next ship, which turned out to be the Fair American, captained by the son of the very person who had so offended the chief, although nobody was aware of that fact at the time. Kame\u02bbeiamoku&#39;s men easily captured the schooner. Thomas Metcalfe and all but one of his crew were killed. The only survivor was Isaac Davis. Kame\u02bbeiamoku appropriated the ship, its guns, ammunition and other valuable goods (just a decade into trading with Europeans, this materiel was extremely useful), as well as Isaac Davis himself.</p>\n\n<p>Simon Metcalfe sailed back to the Big Island, arriving a day after the capture of the Fair American and the death of his son. At Kealakekua Bay, Simon began what seemed to be friendly trade for provisions. When chief Kamehameha learned about the capture of the Fair American he prohibited further contact between the natives and the Eleanora. Simon sent his boatswain John Young ashore to investigate. Young was captured, and Metcalfe was puzzled by the sudden silence.</p>\n\n<p>He waited two days for Young to return, firing guns in hope that the sound would guide Young back. Finally, sensing danger or becoming frustrated, Metcalfe left and set sail for China, not knowing that his son had been killed not far away. He never learned about the attack on the Fair American or the fate of his son. Simon and crew were killed in 1794 by the Haida people of Haida Gwaii (formerly Queen Charlotte Islands) in present-day British Columbia.</p>\n\n<p>John Young and Isaac Davis were instrumental in Kamehameha&#39;s military ventures and his eventual conquest and unification of the Hawaiian Islands. Young and Davis became respected translators and military advisors for Kamehameha. Their skill in gunnery, as well as the cannon from the Fair American, helped Kamehameha win many battles, including the Battle of Kepaniwai, later in 1790, where the forces of Maui were defeated. Young and Davis married members of the royal family, raised families and received valuable lands.</p>\n\n<p>Sources: A variety of Wikipedia articles.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus fact: The Metcalfe&#39;s rendezvous point, Kealakekua Bay, is where 12 years prior Hawaiians had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_James_Cook\">killed James Cook</a>, captain of the first Europeans to arrive in Hawaii. Cook&#39;s crew had similarly stolen from the Hawaiians and they from them, until Cook tried kidnapping a chief and the Hawaiians killed Cook on the shore, at a spot now marked with a monument near the settlement Captain Cook.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-10 12:11:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibw1mv2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v8zybn","parent_id":"t3_v8zybn","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"My action modes:\n\n* Eat\n* shitpost\n* eat while shitposting\n* sleep","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>My action modes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eat</li>\n<li>shitpost</li>\n<li>eat while shitposting</li>\n<li>sleep</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-10 12:32:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibw4g9p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v8zybn","parent_id":"t3_v8zybn","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/the_statustician","body":"Whabbout shit while shitposting?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Whabbout shit while shitposting?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-10 13:12:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibw9vdk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v8zybn","parent_id":"t1_ibw4g9p","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/techno-peasant","body":"What about eating shit while sleeping?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What about eating shit while sleeping?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-10 13:31:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibwcboj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v8zybn","parent_id":"t1_ibw9vdk","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/thoughts4food","body":"Take out post and posting here and its totally my world too!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Take out post and posting here and its totally my world too!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-10 12:38:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibw595i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v8zybn","parent_id":"t1_ibw4g9p","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/TippyTippyTippyTop","body":"Assume i am incredibly dumb and explain why we are going down on the merge:","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Assume i am incredibly dumb and explain why we are going down on the merge:</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-10 15:26:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibwr42d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v8zybn","parent_id":"t3_v8zybn","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/I_LOVE_MOM","body":"Merge hasn\u2019t happened yet.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Merge hasn\u2019t happened yet.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-10 15:27:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibwr8k1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v8zybn","parent_id":"t1_ibwr42d","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Merge and other fundamentals don't override short term market sentiment and momentum.

The potential spot conversion of their BTC and ETH ETFs looks promising now that congress has a proposed bill on crypto regulation to debate.  This would be a great win for individual investors in the United States as well as the crypto industry in general.\n\nFor background, Grayscale holds trusts in digital assets and sells them through ETF shares in the United States.  These trusts are backed by an underlying, but have no redemption mechanism, so they trade at extreme discounts.  The discount is somewhere in the neighborhood of 30%, and with 2% management fees, they only continue trending down as futures based ETFs like BITO see approval.  This discount fundamentally makes sense. You can't buy NFTs with ETHE (their ETH ETF), and there are cheaper options and more accessible ways to hold spot through CEX or personal wallets.\n\nA debate regarding the conversion of these ETFs into spot products has gone on for ages now.  Conversion would allow market makers to redeem shares for the underlying and bring the price close to underlying value, as well as incentivize fees to drop considerably as a competitive market for spot ETFs is created.\n\nThis judgment is purely in the purview of the SEC, which has punted on every required judgment they were supposed to make in order to delay this process.  Every delay is a win for the SEC as they marshal resources to continue a litigious battle against the industry instead of actually writing regulation.  For example, see their hundred million dollar shakedowns of CeDeFi lenders when billion dollar hacks and rug pulls are standard fare at this point.  It is clear they care about clout from sure wins instead of calling balls and strikes.\n\nThe investor protection argument against spot ETFs is thin.  Futures-based products are allowed now, ostensibly because they do not share custody and security issues that spot trusts would.  This argument does not make sense as the futures market is settled by the underlying anyway and is much, much thinner than the spot market.  Additionally, there are multiple regulated CEX institutions that custody spot crypto in the US today.  Lastly, futures-based products are structurally expensive compared to spot trusts, as they suffer from carry from continually rolling over contracts to maintain exposure.  Futures-based products are effectively a persistent tax on holders that goes to market makers.\n\nThe SEC's path on this issue draws considerably narrower in about a month's time when they will be forced to make some kind of statement on Grayscale's request.  If they do not grant conversion, which will most likely be the case, then Grayscale has an opportunity to sue the SEC for the first time and plead their case in court.\n\nBased on the weak position of the Democratic administration and an exodus of lawyers from the SEC, I think the tide is turning in the favor of a financial industry that wants clarity and openness on crypto regulation.  Privately, ex-SEC lawyers are returning to private practice because they 1) are being forced to take cases to court instead of settling and 2) are increasingly being pressured to try crypto cases that they don't think they can win.  Additionally, a nonpartisan wing is forming in Congress that wants to legislate the crypto issue and take power back from an administration they see as hip-shooting, self interested bureaucrats.\n\nOver the last couple of months, my conviction that the GBTC Bitcoin ETF will get approval for spot conversion has strengthened considerably.  The commodity/security status of Bitcoin is clearer (from a regulatory perspective) than Ether.  We are on the eve of legal pressure from Grayscale and they are hiring successful and thorough lawyers to build this case.\n\nPolitically, Democrats, especially progressives, are weak.  The party is slated for a midterm slaughter in November and the loud but inconsequential 'socialist-lite' wing could get hit the hardest.  The chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, who is a former Goldman-exec-turned-MIT-crypto-professor-turned-beltway-bureaucrat, has hitched his wagon to Liz Warren in an ever self serving pursuit of running the Treasury someday.  The falling of the progressive star is unequivocally bad for his political ambitions, which have largely aligned with Warren's crypto takes that are as devout as they are uninformed.\n\nWhat is a bigger question is the place of our community in all of this.  Is Ether a commodity or a security?  The promise of Ether folding into the real financial system hinges on this point.  ETH's status decides whether it will be regulated by the SEC or the CFTC, which has a much more defined and agnostic bent on the crypto ecosystem.  If Ether is a commodity, there is a hard case to make that a spot ETF should not be approved after Bitcoin's ETF is.  If ETH  is a security?  No one really knows at that point.\n\nThe bill brought forth in the senate this week listed both Bitcoin and Ether as commodities, and aims to define a path for decentralized organizations to issue securities with a grace period to reach satisfactory decentralization (a so-called 'safe harbor').  Even if this bill does not pass this session, I think this is extremely bullish signal for the commodity classification case of ETH.  The legislative and legal support for the case is rising as the bureaucrats' power is receding.  Concessions on these points from mainstream Democrats will, for better or worse, likely be on the table through the next few elections to curry favor with the financial industry.\n\nWith this in mind, I have started adding more GBTC and ETHE in my retirement accounts.  This is not financial advice, but I think a small amount of exposure to volatile, uncorrelated assets makes sense in a retirement portfolio for a young person.  With the big picture starting to come into focus, I think the Grayscale discounts represent a huge opportunity for an instant 40% gain in exposure once these products are approved.\n\nI'd be interested to hear thoughts from others following this situation.\n\n*This is not financial advice.*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><em>This is not financial advice</em></p>\n\n<p>I want to talk a bit about Grayscale&#39;s crypto ETF products.

That said, I would say it\u2019s perfectly fine to say it\u2019s depegged from what it\u2019s underlying should be worth though, yes. It should be pegged to ETH price/100, minus 4 years of 2.5% fees or w/e. Market says it\u2019s not, and that\u2019s fine, Grayscale aren\u2019t really trying to peg anyway, they should expect it to float away from ETH price over time due to their fees. LIDO in contrast has unequivocally tried to keep their peg.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-10 08:54:06","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-06-10 08:58:52","id":"ibv9toj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v8zybn","parent_id":"t1_ibv6lg4","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-10 09:07:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ibvbsei","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v8zybn","parent_id":"t1_ibv9toj","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pr0nh0li0","body":"> Intent doesn't matter.
