We discuss technological innovation, TA, lambomoonboi memes, speculative visions of the future, and conspiracy theories about mainstream financial institutions/their behavior...\r  \n\r  \n... but conversations about things like \"hey everyone, what should I do if this particular asset that I purchased increases in value by 45x over the next 8 months?\" or \"if I buy this other asset and its price decreases by over 50% in the first week that I have it, what are some good moves for me?\" are immediately shouted down by the hodlganghodlganghodlgang.\r  \n\r  \nThen, when price action like what we're seeing right now occurs, the majority of the community acts like a deer in headlights & is completely unable to make any moves at all to preserve their capital before getting obliterated by the danger that they knew was coming.\r  \n\r  \nWhat very few people talk about is that there are good answers to these questions out there. What you should do at any given moment depends entirely upon the context of your own personal life. If you have absolutely no more money to buy any crypto if the price tanks by 50% and if your heart flutters/panic sets in when you open whatever app that you use to check your crypto prices - it may be time to ask yourself \"the 50% question.\"\r  \n\r  \nHow would you feel if you converted 50% of your position into cash right now?\r  \n\r  \nThink about this question very seriously while you examine three possibilities:\r  \n\r  \n1.) You sell 50% and Eth goes sideways forever. No big deal, really.\r  \n\r  \n2.) You sell 50% and Eth crashes back to mid-triple digits. Do you still have faith in Eth?

If you only want the market to go up and would be emotionally scarred by the price dropping over 50%, it would probably make sense to consider selling a bit so that you could be happy if the price drops.\r  \n\r  \nRealizing and truly accepting the fact that you are overinvested is a powerful thing. You have the capability to rebalance and change your entire perspective at any time.\r  \n\r  \nJust think about it like this - there are people out there hoping that the price of Eth drops to $500 or less before continuing back to all time highs.
