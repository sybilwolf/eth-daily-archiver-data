But this isn't another hopium laden post about why Ethereum is going to make it. You all should know that already. Instead I'm going to focus on the importance of investing strategy and not getting shaken out.\n\nMaybe the reason why I am not stressing out about this is because I learned this lesson in the last bear market. I took exactly 0 profits in 2017. But this time when we had our epic run up to $4,800, despite the fact that I truly believed we were going to break $8-12K easily, one piece of advice stuck with me. That was to have enough capital in stable assets to pay for your operating expenses to last you throughout the next bear market. So I lined up some goals for the next few years and cashed out part of my stack to pay for that. As a result, while I don't have much dry powder to buy the dip with, I can rest comfortably knowing that despite the current dip, I can still visit Hodlercon and I was able to quit my job which was leaving me dissatisfied. I'm not rich. I'm not retired now or anything but I have enough stablecoins on the sidelines to have 3-6 months worth of expenses paid while I figure out what my next step will be career wise.\n\nMy biggest regret with regards to all of this aside from of course selling it all at the top was not preaching that strategy enough. I shared my cashout plan on multiple occasions but rarely my contingency plan. I was too blinded by bullishness to think that the latter was important enough to share but it is now the life raft I float upon while many others here are struggling to stay afloat.\n\nFinally, for those of you who are struggling, I just want to urge you to find the right, responsible balance when investing in such a volatile asset. I still believe we will see a quick recovery thanks to the merge. This has been a very fast and violent bear so far so I'm beginning to believe that the recovery will also be fast since nobody is expecting that. Everyone is calling for a multi-year bear because that's all they know. But even if I am right (I'm probably not), you need to acknowledge the worst case scenario. Don't ape your emergency fund into ETH just because there's a fire sale. I was almost certain that ETH was going to $10K and the only reason I'm not a nervous wreck right now is because I had enough restraint to acknowledge that I could be wrong and I needed to have my bases covered if I am wrong.\n\nSorry if this turned out to be a bit of a rambling mess, I have had a busy few days in light of quitting my job, moving out and getting ready for Hodlercon. I went all day without checking prices only for a friend to tell me we were at $1,200. I just laughed it off as a good buying opportunity (I sincerely mean it too) and once again had to refrain from irresponsibly throwing in my Hodlercon and unemployed budget money, hence I felt the need to share this.\n\nStay strong everyone and stay responsible. \ud83d\udcaa","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I really am still cool as a cuecomber.

It was universal in lifestyle, gender roles, politics and religion. An offense that was kapu was often a capital offense, but also often denoted a threat to spiritual power, or theft of mana. Kapus were strictly enforced. Breaking one, even unintentionally, often meant immediate death, Ko\u02bbo kapu. The concept is related to taboo and the tapu or tabu found in other Polynesian cultures. The Hawaiian word kapu is usually translated to English as \"forbidden,\" though it also carries the meanings of \"keep out,\" \"no trespassing,\" \"sacred,\" \"consecrated\" or \"holy.\" The opposite of kapu is noa, meaning \"common\" or \"free.\"\n\nThe \u02bbAi kapu was the kapu system governing contact between men and women, including a prohibition on men and women eating meals together. Furthermore, certain foods such as pork (the body form of the god Lono), most types (67 of the 70 varieties) of bananas (body form of the god Kanaloa) and coconuts (body form of the god K\u016b) were considered kapu to women. This not only prohibited women from eating these, but also their contact in contexts such as the manufacture of coconut rope. Taro (body form of the god K\u0101ne) was kapu for women to cook and prepare. Some large fish were also kapu for women to eat.\r  \n\r  \nThe kapu system was used in Hawaii until 1819, when King Kamehameha II, acting with his mother Queen Ke\u014dp\u016bolani, his father's other queen Ka\u02bbahumanu, and Kahuna-nui Hewahewa, abolished it by the symbolic act of sharing a meal of forbidden foods with the women of his court. Abolishing the \u02bbai kapu assured political power to the line of Kamehameha rulers as monarchs because it limited the power of the rulers below them. Originally, it was from this political system that the rulers throughout the island would gain rank, power, and prestige.\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n\nBonus fact: The Hawaiian word \"Kahuna\" refers to an expert in any field. Historically, it has been used to refer to doctors, surgeons and dentists, as well as priests, ministers, and sorcerers. The term was used in the 1959 film Gidget, in which \"The Big Kahuna\" was the leader of a group of surfers. The figure of the Big Kahuna as the best surfer on the beach became common in beach party films of the 1960s. Hawaiian surfing master Duke Kahanamoku may have been referred to as the Big Kahuna, but he rejected the term as he knew the original meaning.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2014 Four days until Hodlercon! \u2014</p>\n\n<p>Ancient Hawaiians had a code of conduct of laws and regulations known as the kapu system.

The Hawaiian word kapu is usually translated to English as &quot;forbidden,&quot; though it also carries the meanings of &quot;keep out,&quot; &quot;no trespassing,&quot; &quot;sacred,&quot; &quot;consecrated&quot; or &quot;holy.&quot; The opposite of kapu is noa, meaning &quot;common&quot; or &quot;free.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The \u02bbAi kapu was the kapu system governing contact between men and women, including a prohibition on men and women eating meals together. Furthermore, certain foods such as pork (the body form of the god Lono), most types (67 of the 70 varieties) of bananas (body form of the god Kanaloa) and coconuts (body form of the god K\u016b) were considered kapu to women. This not only prohibited women from eating these, but also their contact in contexts such as the manufacture of coconut rope. Taro (body form of the god K\u0101ne) was kapu for women to cook and prepare. Some large fish were also kapu for women to eat.</p>\n\n<p>The kapu system was used in Hawaii until 1819, when King Kamehameha II, acting with his mother Queen Ke\u014dp\u016bolani, his father&#39;s other queen Ka\u02bbahumanu, and Kahuna-nui Hewahewa, abolished it by the symbolic act of sharing a meal of forbidden foods with the women of his court. Abolishing the \u02bbai kapu assured political power to the line of Kamehameha rulers as monarchs because it limited the power of the rulers below them. Originally, it was from this political system that the rulers throughout the island would gain rank, power, and prestige.</p>\n\n<p>From Wikipedia</p>\n\n<p>Bonus fact: The Hawaiian word &quot;Kahuna&quot; refers to an expert in any field. Historically, it has been used to refer to doctors, surgeons and dentists, as well as priests, ministers, and sorcerers. The term was used in the 1959 film Gidget, in which &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; was the leader of a group of surfers. The figure of the Big Kahuna as the best surfer on the beach became common in beach party films of the 1960s. Hawaiian surfing master Duke Kahanamoku may have been referred to as the Big Kahuna, but he rejected the term as he knew the original meaning.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-13 11:59:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ic8insq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vb4d6l","parent_id":"t3_vb4d6l","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Interestingly, some alts aren\u2019t totally plummeting with BTC\u2019s price action today.

You can do this yourself with more solid numbers based on a few variables that all change with network usage (so you need to use ranges instead of hard numbers), but just the general scope of the situation should give you a clearer picture.\n\nFirst, issuance. \n\nAfter the merge the daily issuance of Ethereum will go from around an average of ~14,500 ETH per day today to around ~1,300 ETH per day. With the passing of a single block that switches the network over, that's a ~90% reduction in new ETH entering the market, day in, day out.\n\nSecond, where does new ETH go?\n\nCurrently new ETH is paid out to miners for running validators. Many of those those miners don't care about Ethereum, mining crypto is just a business. To be able to actually get mining rewards they need to constantly purchase new and more powerful graphics cards to keep up towards the top of the hashing power otherwise they'll basically never get to propose a block. If a new, better, tech comes out they need to quickly move over their hardware or they'll be at a competitive disadvantage. Those mining setups consume a lot of power, and with all those cards needing to be online and running 24/7 they need to be run and managed in data centers. All of those things cost real fiat currency and are not one time expenses. That means that when they accumulate new ETH, they sell that new ETH on the market to cover their expenses.\n\nThat creates a constantly daily pressure on the sell side that pushes prices down, but more on that at the end.\n\nAfter the merge new ETH is paid to stakers via the Beacon Chain, and on top of that for a period of around 6 months all new ETH that enters the market will be locked to the Beacon Chain the same way that staked ETH is locked now. But, even after that period when withdrawals are enabled, stakers don't have the same expenses to run a validator that miners do. In comparison, a staking validator costs essentially zero to run. Additionally people who stake ETH are the kind of people who are invested in the network's success. Obviously some people will do it as a business and sell earnings, but a significant number of stakers will just keep stacking ETH until they have enough to spin up a new validator and in the meantime use staking pools for the piles of < 32 ETH. On the expense side for them, right now in the US, staking rewards are treated as income earned the moment that the coins are delivered and so you have to pay taxes on that, but the new crypto bill has language that says that staking rewards only cause a taxable event when sold - further disincentive to sell when earned.\n\nNext, burning.\n\nEIP 1559 has been working really well and ETH issuance / inflation has already dipped into being deflationary for a number of extended periods even with ~14,500 new coins being created every day. Original estimates were that the ratio of burned fees to distributed fees (transaction fees are also paid to miners / stakers on top of the new coins) would be around 50/50, but since 1559 has gone live that ratio has been more like 85/15 or 90/10 burned / distributed. That means that the majority of fees on every single block the network produces are destroyed and removed from the economy.\n\nAfter the merge if network usage stays the same, that amount of burning that can turn ~14,500 new coins per day to be entirely offset at times since 1559 went live and greatly reduced most of the time, will make ETH issuance deflationary almost all the time. So ~1,300 new coins will be created per day, but somewhere between ~7,000 to ~16,000 ETH will be destroyed, day in, day out.\n\nSumming up.\n\nRight now, any day (other than the past couple weeks) that you see ETH prices stay flat, which it often happens outside of crazy times, that is because the market was able to find enough buyers and sellers for the price to end up roughly where the day started - more buyers than sellers and the price goes up, less and the price goes down. The estimates are that the total value required to keep ETH prices flat is around $20-$30 million (depending on ETH price) coming into the market every single day to meet the sell pressure coming from miners and regular sellers.\n\nAfter the merge, miner sell pressure instantly disappears, and new ETH created instantly drop 90%. Stakers aren't going to sell all of their rewards, and for like 6 months they can't sell even if they want to. New stakers are going to start staking because the yield on staking will look like a nice investment. Meanwhile 1559 is going to keep burning the same amount of coins removing them from the market, and at the same time demand for ETH is going to stay roughly the same thanks to all the things that you can do using ETH besides speculating on price. With the flip of a switch the amount of free floating ETH circulation will start dropping, day in, and day out. But, all of the much scarcer new ETH will be locked on the beacon chain, or after withdrawals, reinvested into more staking.\n\nThat inverts the market situation. Now the market needs to find $20-30 million worth of ETH that people currently holding suddenly want to sell **just to keep the price flat**. Less people interested in selling, price goes up. So now you have a structural upwards pressure on price where today we have a downward pressure, and the people holding are people who don't have expenses to pay for that yield - many of whom are believers in the goals of the network and aren't going to be easily convinced to sell any part of their stack as they see regularly increasing prices.\n\nAnother wrinkle.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, real bond yields are going to be negative (yield minus inflation gives you the real rate). After the merge, ETH staking will earn ~5% interest in staking fees per year, and importantly that is *paid out in ETH*. Combine the structural upward pressure on ETH prices with a falling dollar value due to inflation, and if you are a large institution looking to store big chunks of money, would you rather buy only US treasuries that are costing you money because of the negative real interest rate, or would you rather put some of that money into ETH that pays out in a currency that will be consistently appreciating against the dollar? Any increase in institutional demand for ETH to stake is going to remove even more from the circulating supply since those institutions are going to be seeking consistent yields primarily and aren't going to be regularly selling everything - that makes it even harder to find a float of coins to meet the average amount needed to be sold every day just to keep prices flat.\n\ntl;dr\n\nNone of us own enough ETH.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sure, but back of the envelope math.
