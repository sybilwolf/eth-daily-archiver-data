ETH went sideways for more or less 5 months until May and started going up from there - only to retest 120$ in Nov 2019. \n* In March 2020 ETH crashed to 100$ again.

Right now there is literally nothing that makes me think this will explode soon. The merge is \"delayed\" (of course it isn't, but thats the narrative), and it will most likely not have a strong impact on the very very short term (so, days/ weeks after the merge, even if the arguments from Hal Press in the bankless podcast are interesting). \n\nSo my take is: even if this is indeed the bottom, there is no need to FOMO now. If it's not the bottom, you can buy even lower. If we have bottomed you can probably buy for a very similar price, but with much higher certainty, that we will not crash again in a few months time. Timing the pico bottom is hard. Patience is really a key in these markets. \n\nIf we are only 6-7 months into the bear market and history rhymes we could go lower, at least 20% (e.g. 1k/20k BTC). \n\nNow does this really matter? I don't know :) As I said I have bought and I am not unhappy I did. This post is def not advocating for pico bottoms and timing everything perfectly.

It was a steady crawl upwards, but a slow one as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even if we assumed that the May peak was the start of the bear (and we are 12 months in) this would basically take us to December 2018. Right now there is literally nothing that makes me think this will explode soon. The merge is &quot;delayed&quot; (of course it isn&#39;t, but thats the narrative), and it will most likely not have a strong impact on the very very short term (so, days/ weeks after the merge, even if the arguments from Hal Press in the bankless podcast are interesting). </p>\n\n<p>So my take is: even if this is indeed the bottom, there is no need to FOMO now. If it&#39;s not the bottom, you can buy even lower. If we have bottomed you can probably buy for a very similar price, but with much higher certainty, that we will not crash again in a few months time. Timing the pico bottom is hard. Patience is really a key in these markets. </p>\n\n<p>If we are only 6-7 months into the bear market and history rhymes we could go lower, at least 20% (e.g. 1k/20k BTC). </p>\n\n<p>Now does this really matter? I don&#39;t know :) As I said I have bought and I am not unhappy I did. This post is def not advocating for pico bottoms and timing everything perfectly. It&#39;s only me reflecting about the last bear market and the mistakes I made back then.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-14 01:02:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"icb0q8k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vbvogd","parent_id":"t3_vbvogd","score":36,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProfStrangelove","body":"Disagree on how you paint March 2020 here. \n\nIt was a violent dump to sub 100$ but then rallied back to 250 rather quickly until start of June. \n\nI think many people would give a finger for a 2.5x from here lol","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Disagree on how you paint March 2020 here. </p>\n\n<p>It was a violent dump to sub 100$ but then rallied back to 250 rather quickly until start of June. </p>\n\n<p>I think many people would give a finger for a 2.5x from here lol</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-14 01:41:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"icb3c8h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vbvogd","parent_id":"t1_icb0q8k","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"Ok, agreed, maybe this was a little short.

Finding doxxed/insured entities across the world to host the physical servers seems trivial. \n\nNFTs to raise some initial capital and carry out light governance seem ok. LSD providing is so profitable that this could easily fund itself the second the ball gets rolling.\n\nAll profits go to a multi-sig dedicated to decentralization research (including the best methods to dissolve the project) and potentially incentivizing liquidity. Employees are paid a high salary with an additional bonus that's locked behind the dissolution of the protocol when its deemed that its job is done.

It&#39;s a problem.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t really understand the Polynya thread you linked to though... How on earth does having a mega validator with 69420 ETH help with decentralization? I must be misunderstanding that pretty grossly. Could you correct me on this one?</p>\n\n<p>Lowered validator requirements are a given at some point x years in the future it feels.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As for potential solutions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Lido puts decentralization ahead of market share and starts price gouging ala Vitalik&#39;s suggestion</p></li>\n<li><p>Competition and a community movement to use other LSD providers (with multiple on the way... It&#39;s too profitable to ignore).</p></li>\n<li><p>A social-layer revolt akin to the &#39;UASF&#39; 2017 movement to stop using Lido. Would be messy and toxic. Let&#39;s call this Plan Z IMO.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It would be cool to see a LSD protocol established with a commitment to decentralization and an ultimate mandate of dissolving itself. </p>\n\n<p>As far as businesses go, it really doesn&#39;t seem like it would be <strong>that</strong> hard to manage... Fork Lido&#39;s contracts and hire a team made up of decentralization-aligned people from the wider Ethereum community. No fungible governance token as this would break incentives massively. Finding doxxed/insured entities across the world to host the physical servers seems trivial. </p>\n\n<p>NFTs to raise some initial capital and carry out light governance seem ok. LSD providing is so profitable that this could easily fund itself the second the ball gets rolling.</p>\n\n<p>All profits go to a multi-sig dedicated to decentralization research (including the best methods to dissolve the project) and potentially incentivizing liquidity. Employees are paid a high salary with an additional bonus that&#39;s locked behind the dissolution of the protocol when its deemed that its job is done. Any extra funds are dispersed to the NFT holders and/or public goods.</p>\n\n<p>Feels a little crazy, but I don&#39;t see why it couldn&#39;t work.

With everything going on I have been putting some thoughts down in long form regarding my experience over the last couple of years and my appreciation for this community.\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s wind the clock back. \n\nI got interested in crypto in 2020 as an emotional hedge. I hated it deeply after it bounced in the pandemic crash and felt disenchanted with the accompanying meme stock mania that, to me, was purely pumped by stimulus checks burning holes in the pockets of depressed, directionless youth.  Everything about my working life to that point contradicted the Boglehead dogma that I subscribed to religiously. I was wrestling with a cognitive dissonance that I was at one moment happy and getting ahead financially but at another feeling like I was missing out on something life changing. \n\nA number of people I knew made obscene money sitting at home during the pandemic trading options on 60, 80, or even 100 Vol stocks.  Finance isn\u2019t my industry, but derivatives mechanics are a stone\u2019s throw from my background, and it was clear to me they had no idea what they were doing.  I aim to always find happiness in the success of people I care about but, taking inventory today, I was resentful.\n\nThis was exacerbated by my diametrically opposite experience of COVID, where my job was effectively 100% on site, full time, in person, and we didn\u2019t really know the full extent of long term risks.  Vaccines and therapies were still far on the horizon.  I saw a lot of older people putting their health at risk to make ends meet while young people sat in their pajamas gambling on Schwab accounts like some satirical Dr. Seussian masters of the universe.  Suffice to say, the world had changed so much, so quickly, and it seemed as if nothing was making sense anymore. \n\nIn autumn of 2020 my girlfriend and I were given COVID by someone close to us that lied about their travel, symptoms, and testing.  I was so excruciatingly upset by this, but there was nothing we could do, so we sat in isolation and got through it together.  During this period, the US election happened.  I distinctly remember watching results coming in on CNN that night sipping from a beer that tasted like seltzer while sucking on cough drops that gave an uncanny menthol sensation without any hint of the flavor. To this day I still think the loss of taste and smell from COVID is one of the weirdest collective experiences we went through and just take for granted two years later. \n\nDuring quarantine, I had been following crypto markets and the wallstreetbets usual suspects.  I love poker and am extremely entertained by others\u2019 speculation, so I\u2019m not going to say I was wholly disgusted, but the fear of missing out had reached a tipping point.  The mania had taken up an unhealthy corner of my headspace and I decided to put some skin in the game so that if it continued up, at least I\u2019d get some benefit, and if it went to zero, well that was okay too. \n\nI had a few accounts on crypto exchanges already from playing online poker.  Many US citizens have the privilege of playing online cards exclusively on shady European sites funded with Bitcoin. We enjoy this experience greatly as it is closely aligned with our unequivocating relationship with liberty and freedom.  I have never thought of myself as part of the well established poker \u2014> crypto pipeline, but I guess I am at least tangential to it.  Anyway, I made my long term buys of Bitcoin and Ether at the literal inflection preceding the 2021 euphoric run up. \n\nThe money isn\u2019t really what\u2019s important, so I\u2019ll summarize by saying that what began as a modest emotional hedge ballooned to meaningful wealth for me. I doubled down by timing the Spring 2021 pico top and bottom almost perfectly based on nothing but a gut feeling. In hindsight, I had gotten extremely lucky three times at this point.\n\nAs many people say, having skin in crypto creates an unrelenting gravity toward better technical understanding of the assets and their potential application. I dove deep into the majors\u2019 history and the current trends before discovering this sub, linked near the bottom of either an arr DeFi or arr Ethereum post.\n\nHow lucky I was to find this place!  On balance, this community has a lot of the technical and financial acumen of the better accounts on CT but with an unrelenting and wholesome positivity. If you are new to these assets, make this your base of operation for the bear market.\n\nIf I had to oversimplify the distribution of beliefs here and how my thinking is positioned, I would still say I lean *extremely* skeptical of crypto.  I am not completely sure that a lot of the issues separating DeFi from the real world and finance (realFi, as I prefer to call it) are solveable.  The only thing I have strong conviction in is that the scaling and decentralization issues will be solved within five years. At that point, the question is whether we succeed at the app layer, which if we do, I think Ethereum is positioned to be the only (or at the very least a major) chain securing decentralized, permissionless business logic. \n\nI had an unnerving worry that we could drop 90%-99% last fall but in my calculation the risk of being wrong was too great to justify going completely to cash.  I have played some modest hedges with success but nothing to the extent of u/ab111292 or others here that have played this trend with obscene success.  \n\nNow that we are here after a huge drop, I am just annoyed with the tiny morsels of gossip that big CT accounts and VCs are putting out there about each other.  I think it is just scaring regular people to stroke their egos as they snipe at each other out of some sick schadenfreude.  I don\u2019t have exposure to these suspected insolvent companies and I have unwound my leverage, so I am sitting tight and just focusing on Starknet tutorials and gambling here and there still with some fun money. \n\nI just want to reiterate how lucky I am for finding this place. Even though I disagree often with voices here big and small, I have not once felt unwelcome (and actually I feel more welcomed sometimes because of it). There are a lot of awesome, solveable problems facing the world. It is scary right now but I am extremely optimistic about humanity\u2019s future, with or without crypto succeeding.  This community has and will continue to be *the* forum for a good chunk of these issues as they relate to digital assets. \n\nI\u2019m still not wholly convinced there is a *there* there, but if there is, it will be discussed best here.\n\nCheers.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s officially about a year from when I started lurking the daily.

To this day I still think the loss of taste and smell from COVID is one of the weirdest collective experiences we went through and just take for granted two years later. </p>\n\n<p>During quarantine, I had been following crypto markets and the wallstreetbets usual suspects.  I love poker and am extremely entertained by others\u2019 speculation, so I\u2019m not going to say I was wholly disgusted, but the fear of missing out had reached a tipping point.  The mania had taken up an unhealthy corner of my headspace and I decided to put some skin in the game so that if it continued up, at least I\u2019d get some benefit, and if it went to zero, well that was okay too. </p>\n\n<p>I had a few accounts on crypto exchanges already from playing online poker.  Many US citizens have the privilege of playing online cards exclusively on shady European sites funded with Bitcoin. We enjoy this experience greatly as it is closely aligned with our unequivocating relationship with liberty and freedom.  I have never thought of myself as part of the well established poker \u2014&gt; crypto pipeline, but I guess I am at least tangential to it.  Anyway, I made my long term buys of Bitcoin and Ether at the literal inflection preceding the 2021 euphoric run up. </p>\n\n<p>The money isn\u2019t really what\u2019s important, so I\u2019ll summarize by saying that what began as a modest emotional hedge ballooned to meaningful wealth for me. I doubled down by timing the Spring 2021 pico top and bottom almost perfectly based on nothing but a gut feeling. In hindsight, I had gotten extremely lucky three times at this point.</p>\n\n<p>As many people say, having skin in crypto creates an unrelenting gravity toward better technical understanding of the assets and their potential application. I dove deep into the majors\u2019 history and the current trends before discovering this sub, linked near the bottom of either an arr DeFi or arr Ethereum post.</p>\n\n<p>How lucky I was to find this place!  On balance, this community has a lot of the technical and financial acumen of the better accounts on CT but with an unrelenting and wholesome positivity. If you are new to these assets, make this your base of operation for the bear market.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to oversimplify the distribution of beliefs here and how my thinking is positioned, I would still say I lean <em>extremely</em> skeptical of crypto.  I am not completely sure that a lot of the issues separating DeFi from the real world and finance (realFi, as I prefer to call it) are solveable.  The only thing I have strong conviction in is that the scaling and decentralization issues will be solved within five years. At that point, the question is whether we succeed at the app layer, which if we do, I think Ethereum is positioned to be the only (or at the very least a major) chain securing decentralized, permissionless business logic. </p>\n\n<p>I had an unnerving worry that we could drop 90%-99% last fall but in my calculation the risk of being wrong was too great to justify going completely to cash.  I have played some modest hedges with success but nothing to the extent of <a href=\"/u/ab111292\">u/ab111292</a> or others here that have played this trend with obscene success.  </p>\n\n<p>Now that we are here after a huge drop, I am just annoyed with the tiny morsels of gossip that big CT accounts and VCs are putting out there about each other.  I think it is just scaring regular people to stroke their egos as they snipe at each other out of some sick schadenfreude.  I don\u2019t have exposure to these suspected insolvent companies and I have unwound my leverage, so I am sitting tight and just focusing on Starknet tutorials and gambling here and there still with some fun money. </p>\n\n<p>I just want to reiterate how lucky I am for finding this place. Even though I disagree often with voices here big and small, I have not once felt unwelcome (and actually I feel more welcomed sometimes because of it). There are a lot of awesome, solveable problems facing the world. It is scary right now but I am extremely optimistic about humanity\u2019s future, with or without crypto succeeding.  This community has and will continue to be <em>the</em> forum for a good chunk of these issues as they relate to digital assets. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m still not wholly convinced there is a <em>there</em> there, but if there is, it will be discussed best here.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-14 07:53:02","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-06-14 10:25:00","id":"icc2wtw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vbvogd","parent_id":"t3_vbvogd","score":41,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/roboczar","body":"speculators always eat their own when things get bad.

Rebasing simply means that your token balance (i.e. the return value of `balanceOf` in `ERC20`) is dynamic. Rather than reading the balance value in the contract state, rebase tokens do a bit more of calculations to show the balance at a given time.\n\nIf your balance changes, that simply means that `balanceOf` returned something different, not necessarily that the underlying stored value has changed through a transaction.\n\n[Here's how `balanceOf` is implemented in stETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x47ebab13b806773ec2a2d16873e2df770d130b50#code#F10#L161).\n\nI believe Lido still has to update their oracle daily, with requires a transaction anyway for both stETH and wstETH.\n\nAnother example is UBI.

The way it technically works is that there's a `getAccruedValue` function that returns how much tokens have you accrued since the last \"snapshot\". `getBalance` returns the sum of your \"snapshot\" (how many tokens you have, stored in the contract) and the accrued value (calculated dynamically, not stored in the contract). Then, whenever you move tokens your accrued value gets written to the snapshot and the snapshot is reset to 0.\n\nThis way, your balance is ever incrementing without the need for UBI to do one transaction per second (or one transaction per day, etc).\n\nI agree with your point that vault tokens are preferrable to rebase tokens.

And BTC maxis it seemed had joined hands with nocoiners like bitfinexed to slam Celsius</p>\n\n<p>On celsius side they didnt reply to the allegations with facts, and instead put out some bullshit &quot;damn the torpedoes&#39; post lmao.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.celsius.network/damn-the-torpedoes-full-speed-ahead-4123847832af\">https://blog.celsius.network/damn-the-torpedoes-full-speed-ahead-4123847832af</a> - wtf is this even... it had no facts, just some bullshit motivational quote type article.  </p>\n\n<p>I think in a normal operating conditions there wouldnt be a run, but with this kind of fear engineered on social media + people already sitting on the edge after Luna episode hardly a month ago, it appears a lot of people with funds on celsius started exiting, and celsius were no longer in a position to let new redemptions.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-14 05:07:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"icbizd2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vbvogd","parent_id":"t1_icbhav9","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"Yeah this is a self fulfilling prophecy.

He switched jobs to a different contractor to gain access to more incriminating information.\n\nWhile intelligence officials have described his position there as a system administrator, Snowden has said he was an infrastructure analyst, which meant that his job was to look for new ways to break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world. An anonymous source told Reuters that, while in Hawaii, Snowden may have persuaded 20\u201325 co-workers to give him their login credentials by telling them he needed them to do his job. The NSA sent a memo to Congress saying that Snowden had tricked a fellow employee into sharing his personal private key to gain greater access to the NSA's computer system. Snowden disputed the memo, saying in January 2014, \"I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers.\"\n\nIn May 2013, Snowden quit his job, telling his supervisors he required epilepsy treatment, but instead fled the United States for Hong Kong where he holed up with journalists to review the documents and in time disseminate their findings. On June 5, media reports documenting the existence and functions of classified surveillance programs and their scope began and continued throughout the entire year. The first program to be revealed was PRISM, which allows for court-approved direct access to Americans' Google and Yahoo accounts, reported from both The Washington Post and The Guardian published one hour apart.\n\nOn June 23 he arrived in Russia, where he was granted asylum and was granted permanent residency in 2020. As for the charges brought against him, Snowden said in response to President Obama's suggestion that he returned to the U.S. to face the charges: \"What he doesn't say are that the crimes that he's charged me with are crimes that don't allow me to make my case. They don't allow me to defend myself in an open court to the public and convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit. ...

Betting on a strike price barely above ATH after the Merge does not really seem that reckless to me, especially since he also emphasises in the interview that his main position is still in spot ETH, not options or leveraged trading...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-14 15:34:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"icdwl5n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vbvogd","parent_id":"t1_icdraxd","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ab111292","body":"I\u2019ll go back and see if he said 5k-8k call spread.
