To me, it shows there&#39;s no free lunch.

Ok, that felt a bit scary but it was really nice to finally use this technology, setting up my own wallet and just experiencing how a decentralized system can work.

This is during the lowest of yesterdays lows and I feel the paranoia as I still got my ETH stack at the exchange. I am not worried about losing all the money, as my stack is insured - well, the current value measured in my national currency that is. But I do not wish to take a loss and I have no idea how long it would take to get the money in case something happens. So I send the rest of my stack to my MM wallet and the transaction instantly goes through.\nSo yeah there it is.
