There\u2019s a 28-year-old translator in Ukraine, running computing hardware on his balcony to earn cryptocurrency so he can buy clothing and other necessities. In Argentina, a retiree uses her gaming PC to double her monthly pension. A college student in Canada has mined enough to buy a BMW motorcycle and a modified 2006 Dodge Charger SRT\u2014and pay for gas every month.\n\nAs many people even outside of the blockchain world know, a crash in the crypto markets has made the past few months quite painful for anyone whose financial well-being is tied to the currencies. As of June 15, the price of Ether was down about 70% for the year. At the same time, a lesser-known factor\u2014a tectonic shift known as \u201cthe Merge\u201d\u2014is set to end Ethereum mining altogether, cutting off earnings for as many as 1 million people. \u201cThis will be a huge financial hit and almost a complete loss of a good source of income,\u201d says the Ukrainian translator, who asked to stay anonymous for fear of being robbed.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrency networks by market value, both record transactions using a process known as proof-of-work, where so-called miners dedicate computer resources toward solving difficult math problems to add blocks of transactions to a public ledger. The miners receive payments in cryptocurrency as a reward. Bitcoin mining, which generally involves specialized gear, has become industrialized; and as mining has moved to data centers, participation by regular people has basically been eliminated. But Ethereum mining relies on the kind of graphics cards found inside typical gaming PCs, and many regular folks can still do it.\n\nProof-of-work is just a contest to make computers work hard, which means it uses an enormous amount of energy. The environmental toll it takes is one of the primary criticisms of cryptocurrencies. Since Ethereum\u2019s beginnings, its developers have been preparing for a shift to an alternative model called proof-of-stake. Under such a system, people would set aside, or \u201cstake,\u201d a certain amount of Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, to win rewards for running software that properly batches transactions into new blocks and checks the work of other validators. Proof-of-stake could cut the power consumption of the Ethereum network by about 99%. It would also put miners out of a job, a significant blow given the capital investment that goes into setting up operations. Ethereum miners have spent approximately $15 billion on graphics processing units (GPUs), according to Bitpro Consulting, and that doesn\u2019t include ancillary costs like wiring and transformers.\n\nThe Merge is expected to take place in August, though no official date has been given. It\u2019s already been pushed back multiple times, and many miners hope that\u2019ll happen again. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be able to pull it off\u201d anytime soon, says Aydin Kilic, chief operating officer at Hive, an industrial Ethereum miner. But other people involved with Ethereum see the Merge as inevitable. \u201cThe odds of it not happening this year are very low,\u201d from 1% to 10%, says Tim Beiko, a computer scientist who coordinates Ethereum developers. \u201cThe thing I want to avoid is someone buying a mining GPU today and the Merge happens this summer,\u201d making it almost worthless.\n\nDespite all this, miners are actually expanding their operations. Prices on GPUs have dropped by more than half since the start of the year, leading to a surge of purchases. Ethereum\u2019s hashrate\u2014a measure of how much mining power is supporting the network\u2014has almost doubled in the last year, according to tracker Etherscan. Even in the current crypto price slump, mining Ethereum is more profitable than supporting any other major coin, including Bitcoin. \u201cI would guess that people are trying to get as much as possible before it ends,\u201d says Slava Karpenko, chief technical officer of 2Miners, an organization that helps smaller miners pool their resources to support Ethereum. The group\u2019s number of active users has climbed 70% since November, to about 120,000, he says.\n\nStill, recouping costs has become more challenging because of Ether\u2019s price drop. Mike Lam, a 38-year-old engineer from Ontario who\u2019s been mining for a year, has earned only about $5,000 worth of crypto on his initial $30,000 hardware investment; he also pays about $650 in monthly electricity costs. Aaron Petzold, 24, a recent college graduate who\u2019s mining Ethereum at his parents\u2019 house in Wisconsin, says he\u2019s about four months away from recouping his investment of more than $28,000. \u201cMy hope is I am going to continue mining until the end,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.

After the Merge, their mining setups will still be powerful computing devices that can be put to use elsewhere, and some are planning to mine other coins or find alternative uses for the gear. After the Merge, Petzold is considering using his rigs for an aspect of digital video production known as rendering, which can require significant computing resources. \u201cThere are other uses for the cards: You can make it into a render farm, you can do different machine-learning options,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are just not going to be as profitable as mining has been.\u201d\n\nCanadian mining pool operator Flexpool is looking to add more coins for its members to mine and plans to deploy its developers to code for other crypto projects, says an executive who asked to be identified only as Chris for fear of getting robbed. \u201cIt\u2019s like a typewriter company,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one is buying typewriters anymore, so you have to shift into other businesses using the capital you made in typewriters.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Ivan Zhang, 35, and Karol Przybytkowski, 36, plan to sell their stable of graphics cards and use their upstate New York facility to host the gear of other miners for a fee. But with many Ethereum miners likely to rush to sell right after the Merge, GPU prices are expected to decline further. Bitpro plans to stop buying graphics cards within weeks, says Mark D\u2019Aria, its chief executive officer. \u201cMy perspective is, no matter what we pay today it is going to be way less after this event,\u201d D\u2019Aria says. \u201cWe are just going to sit there and watch that happen and then pick up the pieces.\u201d\n\nSome miners are hoping to do better by moving to mine other coins that require GPUs, such as Ethereum Classic or Ravencoin. The more miners who flock to any coin, the harder it is to make a profit. But crypto breeds optimism, and miners are building the rationale for why their operations will be the ones to survive. Mikel-Angelo Chalfoun, 30, pays $9,000 a year for a warehouse in Dubai to house and power his 76 graphics cards.
