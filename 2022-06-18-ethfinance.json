I guess this boils down to the need for raw unstaked ETH indirectly playing a heavy role in stabilizing the % of supply that gets staked, both from LSD and the more \"pure stakers\"\n\nYes, I agree with this view. I think you can estimate an approximate equilibrium for the % of ETH staked as follows. You have two different price equilibriums:\n\n- Monetary price equilibrium: Price at which ETH is neither inflationary nor deflationary. This depends on number of staked ETH and network revenues.\n\n- Yield equilibrium: Price at which staking yield reaches an equilibrium (following the reasoning you give above) with the rest of available returns of capital given its risk. This is set by the market and depends also on the number of stakers and network revenues.\n\nIf you equate these two prices you can calculate the number of stakers as a function of network revenues and yield, which are independent parameters as they are set by the market. So you have an equation that accepts network revenues and yield as inputs and tells you towards what # of stakers the network will tend to go.\n\n> I'd also like to explore the even-more-farfetched idea of a hyperethereumized world where somehow the main (if only) currency is ETH.

In fact I almost brought up your &quot;pool of unstaked ETH&quot; idea but it was only tangentially relevant to my broader point. I still daydream about it often!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, if I&#39;m given the chance I will pop in to the discussion. I find cryptoeconomics fascinating and still not well understood due to its nascent status.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It also means pressure for validators to unstake their ETH (post-withdrawals, obviously) and either (1) use it in DeFi protocols where ETH-denominated APYs are much higher than the staking yield due to low liquidity or (2) sell it outright - everyone has a price, including stakers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yep, the balance of all these things (and others including rates of return of other assets) is how prices are set. In this case the price of staking ETH which is its yield.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think (1) is the biggest factor that&#39;ll prevent ETH staking from grabbing too much of supply in % terms, at some point the staking APR + illiquidity + maintenance etc. is just not worth it compared to DeFi protocols with similar risk profiles. This goes for liquid staking too, if stETH&#39;s yield offered to users is 3% APR but the stETH/ETH liquidity pools is 5% APR, then more ETH just flows in that LP which means selling stETH which means Lido has to unstake some ETH from the beacon chain. I guess this boils down to the need for raw unstaked ETH indirectly playing a heavy role in stabilizing the % of supply that gets staked, both from LSD and the more &quot;pure stakers&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, I agree with this view. I think you can estimate an approximate equilibrium for the % of ETH staked as follows. You have two different price equilibriums:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Monetary price equilibrium: Price at which ETH is neither inflationary nor deflationary. This depends on number of staked ETH and network revenues.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yield equilibrium: Price at which staking yield reaches an equilibrium (following the reasoning you give above) with the rest of available returns of capital given its risk. This is set by the market and depends also on the number of stakers and network revenues.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you equate these two prices you can calculate the number of stakers as a function of network revenues and yield, which are independent parameters as they are set by the market. So you have an equation that accepts network revenues and yield as inputs and tells you towards what # of stakers the network will tend to go.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;d also like to explore the even-more-farfetched idea of a hyperethereumized world where somehow the main (if only) currency is ETH.
