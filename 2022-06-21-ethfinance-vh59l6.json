So a 50% drop, whilst huge, would just bring us back to \u201cfair value\u201d. It makes some sense that assets became absurdly overvalued because we had unprecedentedly cheap money.

It\u2019s tough to raise more debt than they already have especially with higher rates. Lower interest rates? They are already close to zero and it would just worsen inflation. Print money?

I hope those of you in Hawaii now are having a blast and getting to enjoy this beautiful planet while taking a break from this crazy market. This week I have had some thoughts on regulation in the space and would just like to share them. It's a bit all over the place, so bear with me.\n\nIn many ways, it's just another year in crypto. A boom and bust cycle of epic proportions. We had a crazy bull run last year with, as usual, a lot of projects with zero world utility making 100-1000x gains followed by rug pulls across the board in the months afterward.\n\nI see many in this community are frustrated with the fact that this market is constantly attacked by outsiders who have done no research about this technology. There are simply just bad optics that contribute to this narrative. But we in the Ethereum community are actually very very lucky that we understand the utility of the tech while most are still wrapping their heads around the idea of decentralized stores of value and P2P currency, which frankly is a boring conversation for most of us here.\n\nIt's not the most popular idea in the broader crypto community, but we need good regulation. Unless you want to see more Terra/Luna/UST/Celcius/etc situations. Without good regulation we are asking to just go through this again and again. Because of the passion and intelligent design behind the development of Ethereum, I assume we can eventually reach some point of being able to identify and even incentivize honest players in the space while rooting out bad actors. The sybil-attacker hunting going after airdrop farming abuse is a good example of this.\n\nIn this sense, the community is self-regulating itself. But we are kidding ourselves if we think we can achieve mass adoption and thrive in a world with zero regulation.  I know that many of us fear over-regulation and I completely agree with those concerns. But the narrative that this whole market is a space where grifters and scammers can thrive has a lot of merit and generally those with little knowledge to the contrary care very little about the innovation behind the tech when they themselves see no benefits to it yet.\n\nI'm aware this a politcs-free sub, so I will just suggest if you are in the US and care about this issue, to write your congressmen on the matter and to vote for who you think would be best for the industry as a whole. As to which party is better or worse in this regard is truly a matter of opinion depending who you ask, so I will not be specific in order to avoid getting political.\n\nI am voting for the party I believe will contribute to improving macro factors the most, as this will get us back on our feet much faster. Unfortunately, I believe this is also the party that will likely over-regulate crypto if given the chance. But at the same time they are the party that I also believe will be more likely to respond to pressure if enough is applied.\n\nBecause I think it's arguable that having zero regulation will eventually lead to over-regulation as a reactionary measure. We can't keep putting this off forever for the sake of some short term gains, which in most cases those of us who are genuinely interested in the tech never get to benefit from anyway.\n\nThe main regard in which the market is over-regulated is where tokens can be defined as securities. But the issue itself isn't that tokens could be declared securities! The issue is that (in the US) only the rich are allowed to invest in securities. If this topic becomes front and center, we could make a lot of noise. And you can bet this is a conversation regulators want to deflect from as much as possible.\n\nPresently the 'use case' of all tokens is to fund projects by dumping on retail. And it's not even a secret. Tokens are a killer dapp though! But in their current state, they don't offer much to the average user. And i think a lot of us want to see that change.\n\nLet's be real, scammers and grifters are a huge liability to all of us.\n\n/end rant\n\nTLDR: some regulation=good, over-regulation=bad, no regulation=more of the same and will eventually lead to over-regulation.

So I may be skewed in opinion one way because of that but I also think the changes to winnings has been a good thing too and better for the overall health of the protocol.  Right now,  I think It may even be economical to actually use it on mainnet again due to (temporary) low gas fees.   Although, with the new reward structure I still believe you&#39;re way better off utilizing the Polygon version of PoolTogether (PT). edit: Important note if you haven&#39;t used PT lately, the small draw winnings ($5, $50 makes no difference) are all separate claim transactions so your claim gas fee can get very high very fast on mainnet.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So really what I think you&#39;re asking is if polygon is safe enough to use PT.  Because I think PT is top notch and has proved itself to be a reputable project, my biggest hang-up with putting any significant coin into PT would be trusting the polygon/matic team. From a non-technical viewpoint, they seem to be trustworthy and the network seems to be running just fine even with the recent drawdowns. I have used the network various times in the past with significant (to me) sums of coin. Polygon/Matic seem to be working to enhance, rather than detract, from the eth ecosystem and they haven&#39;t had any serious negative news lately that I&#39;ve seen.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-21 15:59:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"id8kzdb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vh59l6","parent_id":"t1_id8jgji","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Ribilla_","body":"Thanks for your thoughts, appreciate the write up!
