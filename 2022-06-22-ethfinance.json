But I've been catching up on the big news events and reading some threads and what's struck me is how many half-truth takes there are on the Bancor situation. A lot of calling it an obfuscated ponzi, or BNT designed to head to zero, etc.\n\nYes, BNT is printed **if needed** when IL is too great...BUT it's not literally the *only* thing it does to mitigate IL, it is however where most takes I've read seem to stop. The full version of it is: when people supply single sided assets, we'll say ETH in this case, to Bancor, the protocol supplies the other half in BNT to make an ETH/BNT LP. Since the protocol supplied half the LP, they earn half the trading fees. The protocol also earns an exit fee when people leave their LPs, 0.25% currently from memory. These fees are used first to off-set IL, and only when they're insufficient, then BNT is printed. \n\nNow the tricky part here is to tune the system so that fees earned by the protocol > IL suffered from users. It's not dissimilar from insurance companies tuning their plan pricing and payouts so that revenue of plans bought > costs of claims made. Did Bancor come out of the gate with a perfectly tuned system? No. Does it mean the entire system is broken? Also probably no. Just like the very first people selling insurance probably didn't get it down perfectly either, in fact there's an entire field of math/science dedicated to getting it as tuned as possible. The business model is overall sound though in the long-run, once tuned right.\n\nThe second take that seems to be a lose-lose situation, is the governance one. The multi-sig took action before having a vote, it's not decentralized! Oh, you mean they actually used the [previously voted on multi-sig powers](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/0x69e6083f6fb711185f51b7e0cdcafd29e96a40fabe62c927681701c09bcabd0d)? Kind of like when Curve used it's emergency DAO to nic the Mochi issue in the bud after they gamed the system? Or maybe we should have hoped for a repeat of when Aave wanted to change parameters on weak collateral after an issue in xSUSHI was discovered, but had to wait for a full on-chain vote and subsequent pass to do it. All the while having users on the edge of their seat wondering if they're going to get fucked in the mean-time and wishing there was some kind emergency DAO. Or when Compound was giving out free COMP....and we wished their was an emergency DAO. Or when........you get the point I'm sure. Somebody, somewhere is always going to complain no matter what system you use.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I haven&#39;t been too active recently....been distracting myself with my steam backlog (Cyberpunk 2077 was great btw). But I&#39;ve been catching up on the big news events and reading some threads and what&#39;s struck me is how many half-truth takes there are on the Bancor situation. A lot of calling it an obfuscated ponzi, or BNT designed to head to zero, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, BNT is printed <strong>if needed</strong> when IL is too great...BUT it&#39;s not literally the <em>only</em> thing it does to mitigate IL, it is however where most takes I&#39;ve read seem to stop. The full version of it is: when people supply single sided assets, we&#39;ll say ETH in this case, to Bancor, the protocol supplies the other half in BNT to make an ETH/BNT LP. Since the protocol supplied half the LP, they earn half the trading fees. The protocol also earns an exit fee when people leave their LPs, 0.25% currently from memory. These fees are used first to off-set IL, and only when they&#39;re insufficient, then BNT is printed. </p>\n\n<p>Now the tricky part here is to tune the system so that fees earned by the protocol &gt; IL suffered from users. It&#39;s not dissimilar from insurance companies tuning their plan pricing and payouts so that revenue of plans bought &gt; costs of claims made. Did Bancor come out of the gate with a perfectly tuned system? No. Does it mean the entire system is broken? Also probably no. Just like the very first people selling insurance probably didn&#39;t get it down perfectly either, in fact there&#39;s an entire field of math/science dedicated to getting it as tuned as possible. The business model is overall sound though in the long-run, once tuned right.</p>\n\n<p>The second take that seems to be a lose-lose situation, is the governance one. The multi-sig took action before having a vote, it&#39;s not decentralized! Oh, you mean they actually used the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/0x69e6083f6fb711185f51b7e0cdcafd29e96a40fabe62c927681701c09bcabd0d\">previously voted on multi-sig powers</a>? Kind of like when Curve used it&#39;s emergency DAO to nic the Mochi issue in the bud after they gamed the system? Or maybe we should have hoped for a repeat of when Aave wanted to change parameters on weak collateral after an issue in xSUSHI was discovered, but had to wait for a full on-chain vote and subsequent pass to do it.
