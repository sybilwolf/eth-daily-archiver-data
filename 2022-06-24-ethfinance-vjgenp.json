Or were conditions just different in this shadow fork that brought these bugs to light?\n\nIn general, a sequence of iterative tests should show fewer and fewer bugs as you keep squishing them, or at least, more and more obscure bugs as you throw more and more fuzzing/testing conditions at it each time. The fact that we're running essentially the same test over and over again, and keep turning up new significant bugs, tells me there's a pretty deep pool of possible bugs that have yet to be turned up. We'll get there, but we're not quite seeing the solution converging yet.\n\nNot that I doubt the core devs whatsoever, but things like this remind me that the multi-client architecture Ethereum is pursuing is simultaneously fantastic for decentralization and a little bit of a nightmare for rooting out all the major bugs.

I have been thinking about this for some time, but the dydx decision brought things back into daylight. \n\nWe are talking a lot about decentralisation and security. I think these two are highly valued here and I of course understand why. There are different approaches by different chains when it comes to living these (or not taking them as important as ETH/ we do). \n\nNow my first thoughts were: we need a lot of security and decentralisation. But is this important for everything that might be connected to blockchains? For financial assets it most likely is very important. If you're dealing with real money you don't want to be hacked/ exploited, you want security. If its play money amounts it might not be that important, but if its your life savings or you're a fund and moving millions then security is important. \n\nBut could a less secure chain / setup be viable as well? My second thoughts was that maybe this is possible and/ or even relevant. And this depends on the use case. Let's take games as an example. Will gamers want their ingame items to be 100% secure? Sure, but at the same time they are right now in a very different spot, all their items aren't really their items, they can't trade them and so every improvement will already be huge. For them decentralisation (see Vitalik --> no single party being able to change the characteristics of their items) might be more important. Down the road on-chain ingame items / NFTs also won't be (all) as expensive as they are now/ used to be when e.g. Axis peaked (I saw that now its relatively cheap to start playing it, but it used to be like 0.3 ETH I think which translated into a 4 digit USD investment just to try...). I think this will change with more/ new games. A free to play/ freemium model is likely to be used for blockchain games, there will be very valuable items, but generally speaking it won't be as much value as it used to be. If I play candy crush I appreciate owning my booster or whatever items there are right now in that game, but I don't care if they are secured by Fort Know or not. \n\nAnother example is decentralised social media. This is most likely not about (financial) value at all, but about being able to move your content and social graph with you, so owning your data and contributions. Should this be secure and decentralised? Sure! Does it need to be on the same scale as your life savings? I am not sure. \n\nSo: Do all use cases need ETH style security down the road? I don't think so. Do those use cases that are connected to your savings need high security? Hell yeah. Is dydx a security issue waiting to happen? Most likely. Does this mean that application specific L1s are generally a bad idea? Maybe not so much, if there really are short term technical issue limiting you from progressing (and disclaimer: I can't really tell if those really exist or if this is just an excuse). If I understand things correctly down the road L2s and L3s based on zktech technology will be able to solve all of this. So we can have a lot of stuff that might not really *need* ETHs security but that will still run on a RU cause it doesn't really cost more than running your own L1 - but short term this might be different. \n\nThoughts?

If people assume that the Ethereum Foundation exists as the &quot;business side&quot; of Ethereum they&#39;re going to be sorely disappointed. As a decentralized network, the only way that Ethereum will be marketed is if the people participating in the network take that responsibility. It&#39;s kind of crazy, much of the crypto advertising I see is from companies and organizations actively extracting value, but the biggest beneficiaries of Ethereum value are the token holders- those people must take action and promote the network, but instead most just sit idly by wondering when someone else will take action to make their investment more valuable.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-24 03:41:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"idjkglt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vjgenp","parent_id":"t1_idjjn7f","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Honestly, this is something I like about Ethereum the most.

Hopefully too the Solana Pay thing will gain some traction, even if SOL is a centralized shit chain, it really seems like we should be buying more stuff IRL (or digitally besides NFTs) with crypto rather than credit cards. I don't wana Solana to \"win\" but if retailers are able to see the power of not paying a real processing fee + instant settlement in some cases it will start to put some serious pressure on traditional payment processors.
