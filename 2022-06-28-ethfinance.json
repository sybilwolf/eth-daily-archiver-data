This has two primary benefits. First, the proof removes the need for verifiers to execute the computation themselves to ensure it is valid since the proof can only be generated if the computation or transactions it is proposing are valid in the first place. In the case of rollups, this allows for transactions to be batched leaving less computation for node operators and less data needing to be stored on chain. Secondly, this allows the ability for sensitive data in the computation to remain secret due to the computation only being run by the prover. For example, one of the simplest implementations of this is confidential transactions. Rather than publicly revealing the balance of account A and account B at any point, a zero knowledge proof can be generated to prove to the network that account A\u2019s balance is \u2265 the value they are sending to account B. This means that in this process, the balance of accounts A and B, nor the value of the transfer is revealed since the zero knowledge proof provided proves the validity of the transaction.\n\nAnother example of the use of zk proofs is the zkRollup. For the uninitiated, a rollup is basically a large batch of compressed transactions which are verified on the main chain at regular intervals. zkRollups are the most secure type of rollup. Unlike optimistic rollups which use economic incentives and fraud proofs to resolve disputes, zkRollups use a zero knowledge proof to prove that a batch of transactions are all valid. Since it is of course not possible for a zero knowledge proof with an invalid transaction to be generated, there is no need to later verify or dispute the zero knowledge proof. This offers scaling on Ethereum of up to 2,000 tx/second in their current state and up to millions of tps once Danksharding is introduced.\n\nZero knowledge proofs offer a lot of value to Ethereum in many different ways. As shown in the examples above they can be used to increase the scalability of Ethereum in the form of a zkRollup or used to perform transactions without revealing sensitive information, great for use cases where privacy is a necessity. Additionally, one of the most significant long term possible use cases for zk proofs is to effectively zkSNARK-ify everything on Ethereum. So rather than having all computations executed by the EVM on all nodes on the network, zk proofs could be used so that only the block prover has to run the EVM computation and all other network participants can simply refer to the proofs. The same goes for other network computation such as signature verification among other things. The effect of this is greatly reduced data and computational requirements to run a node as well as helping to make Ethereum\u2019s cryptography resistant to the threat of quantum computers which will at some point be able to break conventional cryptography.\n\nSo what is the current state of zero knowledge tech on Ethereum?\n\nZero knowledge proofs are used in a wide range of privacy tech on Ethereum including but not limited to: zk.money: A zkRollup which offers privacy to all transactions between accounts on the rollup and partial privacy to transactions on and off the rollup. Tornado.cash: A decentralised privacy mixer which allows anyone to deposit funds and later withdraw them to a new address anonymously. Nightfall: A private enterprise optimistic rollup which utilises zk proofs to offer privacy to the enterprises using the rollup. Semaphore: A protocol which allows users to privately prove their membership of certain groups or to vote or make endorsements while preserving the privacy of parts of their identity.\n\nCurrently, many zkRollups are still limited in their functionality due to not being compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Basically, this means that apps on Ethereum such as Uniswap cannot simply be ported over to the zkRollup easily. However, there are currently a few teams building different types of zkRollups.\n\nzkSync currently has zkSync 2.0 in testnet which will be EVM compatible unlike their current zkSync V1, zkSync 2.0 will allow apps to be easily ported over. Furthermore it will be highly scalable, provide the full security of the Ethereum L1 and allow for instant withdrawals without the need for 3rd party bridges for instant withdrawals as is the case currently with Optimistic rollups.\n\nAnother team, StarkWare is building StarkEx and StarkNet. Currently StarkEx is powering application specific zkRollups such as dYdX which offers instant trades, no gas fees and full Ethereum L1 security. But where it gets really promising is with their new main net alpha of StarkNet which is a general purpose ZK rollup. While similar to zkSync 2.0, StarkNet has a couple of important differentiations. Firstly, it uses a different type of zkProof known as a zkSTARK compared to zkSync 2.0\u2019s PLONKs. The end result of this is that it is quantum resistant. The other main differentiation is that StarkNet is using its own programming language, Cairo as opposed to Ethereum\u2019s solidity, though apps can be translated to Cairo using software. While this may act as a barrier making porting apps over to StarkNet harder, the benefits will still be worth it for many developers and users.\n\nFinally, the are a few other zkRollups being built such as Polygon Hermez and Scroll but to go into every project in detail would require a whole post on its own. Hopefully this has been a helpful introduction to the fascinating but often confusing world of zero knowledge technology. if you want to learn more about rollups and zkRollups I\u2019d highly recommend checking out some of u/Liberosist\u2019s posts on the topic. or if you want to learn more about zero knowledge tech specifically, Matter Labs curated a great list of resources here: https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Let&#39;s talk zero knowledge technology.

They are not. Security and cryptography have very little to do with cryptoeconomics.\n\nHe makes the tired old \"blockchain is a solution in search of a problem\" argument, because he simply must be ignorant of, or intentionally ignoring, the large and growing number of very real problems that have been solved, either partially or completely, by decentralized trustless systems. To turn his argument around, he's basically saying \"There is no trustless solution that is not better as a trusted solution. Central entities do everything better.\"\n\nEmphatically, no they don't. I could give many examples where the decentralized version is better, but to name the very most basic one, transferring money internationally is trivially easy with crypto, and labyrinthine and expensive and slow and compromised with centralized entities. Not only that, and this is the key reason crypto exists- systems controlled by central entities always, always, always end up abusing their users sooner or later, because they are in a position of power and it's simply human nature to use (abuse) that power for your own benefit when you have it, and even if one individual human declines to do so, the next one to come along likely will. Decentralized systems remove that power from any centralized entity, meaning the humans in the loop are unable to abuse power because they don't have it. (Obviously this is an aspirational goal; many systems have partial centralized components, but some are fully human-free now, and many others are moving in that direction).\n\nHe also makes the argument that no blockchain is fully decentralized. It's a valid criticism to point to the so-called \"Nakamoto Coefficient\" of various chains - the number of entities who would need to collude in order to compromise the finality of the chain or censor it, and say that that number is low. But any time that number is more than 1 (which it is for e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum) that's a strictly superior situation to any traditional centralized entity that is capable of changing everything whenever it wants. Those two, three, or more entities would all need to meet up and decide that they wanted to compromise the very chain they are massively, massively invested in. Not impossible, but so much more unlikely than a single centralized rogue actor deciding (or being forced) to do so. There are blockchains that are centrally controlled, and I would fully agree that those are trash and useless. But to make the sweeping claim that no blockchain is meaningfully decentralized is at best ignorance.\n\nHe points out that there are numerous centralized intermediaries present in crypto. I partially agree with his criticism here - for most people, when they interact with crypto, it's via a centralized exchange, or a centralized API server, or what have you. This is not optimal, and presents the usual concerns for abuse of power (and simple lack of redundancy). However, this is not an inherent problem with crypto. It is very possible to use it in a fully decentralized manner. For example, I run Ethereum nodes, and can personally connect my MetaMask wallet to them, and submit transactions to the network with zero centralized entities in between me and the chain. I often don't bother to do this, because using the centralized equivalent is usually easier, but in adversarial conditions where the centralized party was censoring me, or even just having technical difficulties, I could access the network directly. Most people don't run nodes, of course, but that will change - we have designs for \"light nodes\" in works that can be run in the background in any browser or mobile device. The goal we are shooting for is decentralized-by-default, where everyone has local direct access to the underlying blockchain. So at most, his criticism here is a short-term one.\n\nHe claims that Proof of Stake is controlled by those who hold the coins in the system, which is simply false - stakers (coin holders) decide *block contents* in Proof of Stake, whereas it's the node operators, a superset of stakers, who decide which upgrades to incorporate or not. There do exist some blockchains where they have what's called \"on-chain governance\", where coin holders vote on upgrades and other administrative things, and this would be a valid criticism of those chains, but on-chain governance is in no way typical or standard for PoS chains. Ethereum doesn't use it (after an early failed experiment with it convinced everyone it was a dumb idea.)\n\nAll in all, he simply doesn't grasp the basic concepts here. And when you don't understand that crypto exists to defeat abuses of trust, of course it will seem useless to you. Again, at best, I think he's just ignorant, perhaps willfully so, but perhaps more likely he's a victim of Stockholm Syndrome, and thinks that all the big corporations and governments and other centralized entities are actually our friends, and are doing everything as well as it is possible to. They are not, and for the simple reason that they feature humans in positions of power, who abuse that power for their own benefit. At worst, he is actually in their pay, but I wouldn't make any claims of that nature. In his actual areas of expertise, he's been a voice for reason, so it seems unlikely he's been compromised in this way.

I'm thinking I'll share the post tomorrow at this rate. Today's section is on EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity.\n\n------------------------\n\n**EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity**\n\nAs I covered a while ago in [a previous post of mine,](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/) ETH doesn\u2019t have a supply cap like Bitcoin. Instead, it has a monetary policy of \u201cminimum viable issuance\u201d, not only is this is a good thing for network security, but with the recent addition of EIP-1559, net ETH issuance is variable due to its fee burning feature. During times when network demand is high, transaction fees can rise to levels at which the amount of fee revenue being burned is greater than the inflation rate from new ETH issuance going to miners (and stakers post-merge). In effect, this fee burn acts a lot like a company such as Apple using profits to perform share buybacks, except instead of Apple using money from selling iPhones to reduce the supply of Apple shares, Ethereum is using the profits it makes from selling scarce, decentralised block space to reduce the supply of ETH. This creates a constant negative supply side pressure which without a matching reduction in demand, will lead to ETH price appreciation.\n\nSo what does this mean for ETH scarcity? It means that if the Ethereum economy is healthy and there is a constant demand for Ethereum\u2019s scarce, decentralised block space, there will be a sink in the form of the fee burn which reduces the supply of ETH. If the fee burn is high enough, the fee burn can outweigh the new issuance being minted for miners and stakers. This threshold is around 100-150 Gwei under Proof of Work and around 10-15 Gwei post-merge/under Proof of Stake.\n\nThe long term prediction for ETH supply according to Ethereum researcher Justin Drake is that supply will peak just before the merge just below 120 million ETH before decreasing post-merge where over time the burn will lessen relative to new issuance before ETH supply eventually floats around 100-120 million ETH or continues to decrease at a slow rate. You can create your own post-merge issuance models by playing around with the variable inputs on [ultrasound.money.](https://ultrasound.money)\n\nMore details on this topic can be found in the Bankless Podcasts with Justin Drake.

Even if it were theoretically secure, which current systems have been proven not to be over and over, the issue of trust can not be solved with complicated math. Because then the people have to trust the math and the code, or respectively those who&#39;ve written and implemented it. It will automatically lead to suspicion and distrust among those who don&#39;t understand it, even though the intentions may have been the opposite.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-28 05:59:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ie1srn8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vmexpb","parent_id":"t1_ie1qive","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/burfdurf","body":"More technical people can go into more detail or correct me...

And yes it would put some additional space requirement to produce block executions but at most that would be a general blockchain bloat problem and not really a problem for individual proposers right?  If I&#39;m understanding the implications of them saying this, &quot;The gas consumption of the ciphertext transaction counts towards the gas limit of the block it was included in&quot; correctly.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>what if transactions are scheduled for a block which has a base fee too high to execute the scheduled private transactions, etc</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly I think they address this in the transactions fees section where you include an envelope which pays transactions fees at the moment the cyphertext is included in the transaction. At least that&#39;s my reading.  It does seem like the fee mechanisms are a bit different with gas consumption rather than gas limit but I can&#39;t see any real issue with that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>not offer any strong guarantees</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems be a pretty strong defense against MEV attacks on any encrypted transaction right?  How would searchers get around this?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Or maybe it&#39;s ZK to the rescue again: <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-resistant-zk-rollups-with-practical-vde-pvde/12677\">https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-resistant-zk-rollups-with-practical-vde-pvde/12677</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-28 19:15:38","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-06-28 19:24:47","id":"ie4wklw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vmexpb","parent_id":"t1_ie4s9ff","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sm3gh34d","body":">Block producers collect encrypted as well as plaintext transactions for a block.
