This translates into real-world profits for storage providers, which incentivizes them to continue committing additional hard disk space to the Filecoin network. However, when storage providers are storing data from Filecoin users, their likelihood of winning block rewards goes up by a big factor \u4e00 10x! Because NFT.Storage participates in the Filecoin Plus program, all data uploaded through the service is eligible for this 10x reward multiplier. This is such a powerful incentive for Filecoin storage providers to store user data that they tend to be willing to offer free storage and retrieval services in order to get this block reward multiple. As a result, most storage providers offer free storage and retrieval on Filecoin today and will continue to do so as long as block rewards continue to be a powerful incentive. This should be true for a very long time \u4e00 for example, it is still the case that block rewards are powerful incentives for Bitcoin miners today.

Incentivizing them to provide ever more disk space. And no one pays for it :)\n\nThe comparison to Bitcoin doesn't work because Bitcoin doesn't store large files, the miners do arbitrary calculations that get adjusted according to profitability. But stored data can not be adjusted down. This is essentially a storage ponzi. It only works as long as continuous growth and usage keeps the Filecoin price high enough for the mining to be profitable. It's hard to know anything about the current situation, because Filecoin isn't mined by individual miners anyway but large farms in China and elsewhere. So you're hard pressed to find anyone who even has experience mining it in the relevant forums. Most would tell you it wasn't profitable even when the price was high. I wouldn't be surprised if we see data disappear soon. \n\nBtw Arweave fills the permanent storage requirement and has an economic model that actually works, at least in theory. It's used by some NFT projects already, when you look into their data a lot of it is NFTs. But even there a lot of miners have dropped out recently.

Whenever someone uses the Ethereum network to do anything (for example to use MakerDAO's stablecoin issuance service, which is itself hosted on Ethereum), that user is required to pay a network fee denominated in ETH. The Ethereum network then destroys (\"burns\") the majority of the network fee that was paid. The Ethereum network is currently destroying ETH at a rate of 1.2M ETH per year. After the network's issuance reduction this year, the network will be issuing new ETH at a rate of 0.6M ETH per year.

What that means is that companies can be created entirely out of software now, without ever registering a legal entity. Software itself can't issue a stock either, but it can issue a cryptocurrency token. So we have this situation where a piece of software's profit accrues directly back to the software itself, and then the software must distribute that profit in some way. The most common way is to use cryptocurrency tokens to keep track of who should receive that profit.\n\n99% of the general public is completely lost on the idea that software itself can now sell a product and generate and distribute the profits.

At least a select few of them are. Here&#39;s a write-up that I posted as a reply in another subreddit, exploring how MKR and ETH both behave like traditional shares of stock.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that it might be of educational interest to ethfinance readers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Customers pay to use the cryptocurrency network or system, which generates profits, then those profits get paid out to tokenholders, just like company profits are paid to stockholders.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to walk you through a couple of concrete examples which might help make this idea more tangible. Take for instance MakerDAO, a digital autonomous organization running on top of Ethereum. A digital autonomous organization, or &quot;DAO&quot;, is a business with no corporate legal entity, managed directly by a piece of software running on a blockchain. This on-chain software provides services and collects and distributes profits.

ETH involves \"the tying of each individual investor's fortunes to the fortunes of the other investors by the pooling of assets, usually combined with the pro-rata distribution of profits.\"\n\n**With the expectation of profit?**\n\nProbably not. First and foremost, there's the expectation that the purchased ETH can be used as a commodity to exchange for network services. There's no central body to set an expectation for profit, so if a person believes there's profit to be had in holding it, that's entirely on that person's own judgement.\n\nIn other words, ETH's expectation of profit derives entirely from its useful market value as a commodity. It's the same as holding on to steel, or lumber, or gold or palladium with the expectation that demand will go up and you can resell it later. Like for example non-renewable resources like oil, ETH may or may not trend towards becoming more scarce over time.\n\n**To be derived from the efforts of others?**\n\nProbably not. The Ethereum network is permissionless - ETH profits are derived from the network becoming more useful, which happens due to the collective efforts of whoever wants to contribute to it. There's nothing stopping you from writing and running a geth patch, or providing liquidity to Uniswap, or writing a new DApp, or doing any number of things that contribute to the value of the network (and thus any \"expectation of profits\" you may have personally ascribed to the ETH token). Any expectation of profits comes from the network's own inherently snowballing utility, plus the utility that people just like you add to it without needing to ask any permission.\n\nThe only squirrely part left is that the Ethereum Foundation and client teams could be said to be providing network updates that might lead to an expectation of profit. But is that not the exact same thing with Bitcoin, its ongoing client software development, and its Taproot upgrade? (lol)\n\nGiven this reasoning, combined with remarks over time from SEC officials that ETH doesn't seem to be a security, I'm quite confident that ETH will not be classed as a security even though it has some stock-like properties.

A united human race, all \"speaking one language,\" [decided to come together there and build a really kickass, tall tower there.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel) Like, a tower so tall that it would reach the heavens. My interpretation of the story is that \"speaking one language\" means that back then, everyone was actually able to communicate wordlessly and perfectly with each other without needing to use conventional language, such that there was zero language barrier and zero loss of information. Everyone knew exactly what everyone else was trying to say, just by looking at them trying to express their thoughts. Anyways, Yaweh, the Hebrew god, got spooked when he saw everyone coming together to build the tower to the heavens. So he cursed humanity to all speak different languages, and then scattered everyone out across the world. Nowadays, for your thought to become another person's thought, it has to be translated from your head into words and then from words into someone else's head. That's two lossy translation steps, such an inefficient way to communicate. Can you imagine the amazing things humanity could create if everyone inherently and instantly just understood each other? Disclaimer: This is only a mythological story that I believe results in an interesting thought experiment, I don't mean to suggest that the story is to be taken literally.\n\nRant aside, even when I have a conversation on a non-crypto subreddit that nominally seems to end up being a complete waste of time, the saving graces are twofold:\n\n1. Writing about my perspectives on complex topics helps me reason through them in a way that's much harder for me to do in spoken conversation on the fly. I do my best thinking while writing. Even if nobody were reading my writings, writing would still be the most effective way for me to collect my thoughts and establish my own beliefs in such a way where I can explain my reasoning in the future.\n\n2.

To his credit, he admits that's it's going to be a lot of work, and that it's a 'risky move.'  The Bankless boys did push him a little, although there's a few more difficult questions I wish they had asked,  but overall I was pretty happy with the interview.\n\nMy *personal* opinion is that he's just making the wrong trade-offs.  It sounds like he wants dydx to be one of the biggest crypto exchanges, and he wants it to be as decentralized as possible, and while those are good things, their strategy for going about it isn't the one that I think will be the most successful.  \n\nI think he probably underestimates the value of network effects and composability for retail users, and seems to be gearing the platform for the large market makers.  I suppose that makes sense from a numbers standpoint, since they have more money and are probably willing to go through a more onerous onboarding process to make more money, but if there are no retail users to fleece, I'm not sure they'll care.  Seems like retail is really the crucial piece of the puzzle here, and the infrastructure for onboarding retail users to Ethereum is a wheel that doesn't need to be re-invented.\n\nHe was also pretty hand-wavy about how many validators there would be for the new chain, and who was going to run them, and how they were going to be incentivized to secure it, and all these things that are also already sorted with Ethereum.  He told me personally online in a tweet that the team wouldn't be running any validators, only the community, but I'm not sure how anyone could audit that.  If the 'community' running the validators ends up being all 40 dydx employees to maintain the majority, then how is that better than a centralized server? Also, the Bankless guys didn't push them on it, but 50% of the dydx tokens are held by insiders, and if one assumes that would be the token which pays for security (what else would it be?) then that makes me question the decentralization narrative as well.\n\nHis main gripe was that the current version uses a centralized orderbook, and that roll-ups were still years away from deploying decentralized tech they could actually use, and they want to grow in the meantime, which I understand and am sympathetic to.  But if you're just going to grow into a *different form* of centralization, then I don't really see the point, personally.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I listened to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij7qt0lNQcM\">the Bankless episode with dydx founder Antonio Juliano</a> today, and thought it was pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>My impression of Antonio is that he&#39;s not a bad actor, and he&#39;s truly doing what he thinks is best for the platform.

It sounds like he wants dydx to be one of the biggest crypto exchanges, and he wants it to be as decentralized as possible, and while those are good things, their strategy for going about it isn&#39;t the one that I think will be the most successful.  </p>\n\n<p>I think he probably underestimates the value of network effects and composability for retail users, and seems to be gearing the platform for the large market makers.  I suppose that makes sense from a numbers standpoint, since they have more money and are probably willing to go through a more onerous onboarding process to make more money, but if there are no retail users to fleece, I&#39;m not sure they&#39;ll care.  Seems like retail is really the crucial piece of the puzzle here, and the infrastructure for onboarding retail users to Ethereum is a wheel that doesn&#39;t need to be re-invented.</p>\n\n<p>He was also pretty hand-wavy about how many validators there would be for the new chain, and who was going to run them, and how they were going to be incentivized to secure it, and all these things that are also already sorted with Ethereum.  He told me personally online in a tweet that the team wouldn&#39;t be running any validators, only the community, but I&#39;m not sure how anyone could audit that.  If the &#39;community&#39; running the validators ends up being all 40 dydx employees to maintain the majority, then how is that better than a centralized server? Also, the Bankless guys didn&#39;t push them on it, but 50% of the dydx tokens are held by insiders, and if one assumes that would be the token which pays for security (what else would it be?) then that makes me question the decentralization narrative as well.</p>\n\n<p>His main gripe was that the current version uses a centralized orderbook, and that roll-ups were still years away from deploying decentralized tech they could actually use, and they want to grow in the meantime, which I understand and am sympathetic to.  But if you&#39;re just going to grow into a <em>different form</em> of centralization, then I don&#39;t really see the point, personally.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-28 22:46:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ie5irgq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vn7hq5","parent_id":"t3_vn7hq5","score":37,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/aaqy","body":">But if you're just going to grow into a   \n>  \n>different form  \n>  \n> of centralization, then I don't really see the point, personally.\n\nExactly","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>But if you&#39;re just going to grow into a   </p>\n\n<p>different form  </p>\n\n<p>of centralization, then I don&#39;t really see the point, personally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Exactly</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-28 23:29:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ie5mbq4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vn7hq5","parent_id":"t1_ie5irgq","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/TurboJetMegaChrist","body":"I enjoyed the interview.
