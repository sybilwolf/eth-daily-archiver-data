I'm personally very excited to see how this all unfolds.\n\n# DYDX Bankless Episode Notes\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n- Building out their new chain will be a TON of work - they'll be building new bridges, wallet connections, indexer, modules, blockchain itself, etc\n\n- Want to make a fully vertically integrated product, closer to something like FTX in the long run\n\n- Team is super ambitious - aiming to have the work open sourced by the end of the year\n\n- Own blockchain does lose some decentralization, but in many ways it is still as decentralized as an upgradeable protocol like AAVE for example\n\n- tradeoff they've made is composabilty for scalability and decentralization\n\n## **DYDX Bankless Episode**\n\n- Intro -What we want to answer is if were going to have an app chain world or a layer 2 world? Where will Smart Contracts live?\n\n- State of the nation - Tug of war between Cosmos App Chain and ETH layer 2s\n\n- (7:20) interview starts. Founder (Anotonio) left CoinBase 5 years ago because he wanted to make a better exchange\n\n(8:45) Why Antonio? We know your a product maximalist not a chain maximalist so lets hear your Reasoning? (Ryan Pulls up tweet from DyDX founder)\n\n- Success means the best possible product * the best possible distribution\n\n- Sees Cosmos as the opportunity to build the best possible product, he definitely sees this as a risky decision. They don't KNOW if they can build the best product on Cosmos, but they think they might be able to push the needl on on what's possible.\n\n- [References second tweet](https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1539725009857515522?s=20&t=B7NVW_fGyZGqxvki0SydRw), what is product? UX, Futures, decentralization, security David: Those four parameters will be a pillar of this conversation. The aggregate score is higher for an app chain is your argument? Regardless how it works out, we're going to get a lot of data from this move. Can you give us high level pitch on these 4 parameters for an app chain?\n\n- Currently there are 2 pieces of DyDX a centralized order book on AWS, and the decentralized system on StarkWare. Currently very good UX, features, decentralization not great, security is high\n\n- Currently, Starkware et al are not really decentralized, there could be censorship bc of the centralized sequencer.(Ian lookup sequencer vs block builder)\n\n- Very important for DyDX to keep doing orderbook trading, there\u2019s a lot of institutional support from market makers on DyDX currently.\n\n- We asked what blockchain can handle 1000 TPS with 0 fees? Answer - None so they need off chain order book\n\n- In V4 there will be a decentralized off chain orderbook, but there won't need to be a consensus. Orderbook not having to reach consensus is the key driver of scalability.\n\n- Emphasizes decentralization(system) = min_decentralization(system.components)\n\n- Orderbook turns into mempool type model - every order book will have their own pending transactions. Flesh out mempool analogy\n\n- **Resource:** [What is a mempool? (Blocknative)](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/mempool-intro)\n\n**David: (26:11) So what does decentralized block production/ sequencing actually get you?**\n\n- Up to community about whether or not DYDX L1 token will be the one used on Cosmos\n\n- They want to deliver the best possible product right now (2-3 year time horizon), don't wana wait for Starkware to decentralize\n\n- DyDX not afraid to move on from the tech they currently use, one of their strongest suits. Most teams reluctant to build new things.\n\n- Not afraid to fail and need to come back if necessary.\n\n**David: (34:00) How is this move risky?**\n\n- First there is so much to build - blockchain, modules, off chain orderbook, oracle network, bridges, indexer, mobile app, website. Biggest risk is they bit off more than they can chew.\n\n- They started doing research beginning this year, they want to have a open source product by the end of the year.\n\n- They are talking to circle to get a native USDC deployment\n\n- Maybe the tech doesn't improve fast enough? Maybe Antonio is just wrong, maybe the communities around ETH are too important. People just want to be on one chain maybe.\n\n**(38:00) - Will wallets need to be built?**\n\n- Yes kinda, wallet interface will need to be rebuilt, can still use MM\n\n- They kinda already did this V3 (look up Stark private public keys on v3)\n\n- **Resource:** [What is a Stark key?]([https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/4797307-what-is-a-stark-key#:~:text=dYdX users are identified within,the Stark-friendly elliptic curve.)](https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/4797307-what-is-a-stark-key#:~:text=dYdX%20users%20are%20identified%20within,the%20Stark%2Dfriendly%20elliptic%20curve.))\n\n- Using DyDX chain will feel different than any other chain\n\n**(40:00) How many validators are you hoping for? How are you gonna pay block rewards to these stakers?**\n\n- Still researching the optimal limit here and the tradeoffs related\n\n- Will start around 50-100 validators, decentralized ENOUGH to start he says. Maybe opportunity to become a validator here.\n\n- Failure cases for Tendermint consensus: (1/3rd dishonest)\n\n- **Resource:** [What is Tendermint?](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html)\n\n- Chain gets halted, cant lose funds at least.\n\n- Community could stop staking to those validators and the chain will resume without issue\n\n- Failure (2/3) dishonest:\n\n- There are security tradeoffs on building a L1 vs building ON a L!\n\n- notably you get soverignity can do stuff like fork, have token votes\n\n- In the worst case community could fork DyDX chain to thwart an attack (this seems kinda alarming)\n\n- From a pragmatic product perspective, cosmos L1 might be in the ballpark or better than other options\n\n**(49:45)More validators = more latency = more MEV opportunities?**\n\n- One of the cool things about Tendermint is you know leaders ahead of time. Know who the next validator is? They wana take what Solana has done in terms of reducing latency from a technical perspective.\n\n- One tradeoff they've made is composability for scalability and decentralization and lots to build. They try to compare themselves not to just other protocols but to major tech companies. A trend over time is that tech companies become more vertically integrated.\n\n**(60:00) There\u2019s a theory that this migration that this is legally motivated. Decentralizing fully makes it a legally much better system. Can you talk about that? David references Validium legal issues.**\n\n- Doesn't want to get too much into the legal stuff.

My normally attractive pride! Looking totally like you today! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb I apologize up front for the length of this post ... but you know ... ban me if you don't like it or whatever. I'm still working on my site but I wanted to leak a some more details, get some juices flowing and see if anyone else is interested in helping. Please PM me.\n\n*Oh god John! What have you done!?*\n\nI have had this vision for a community website since before the EVM launched. Then the EVM launched and all these new thoughts started banging around in my head. Here's the tldr; though: I believe it is time for us all to have a home outside these walls. Since getting my words to show what I want in your brains is hard, I created ***Caches***^(PM me to try it out)\n\nReposted from the Caches forums:\n\n*What is caches?*\n\nCaches is my greatest work. No but seriously, it is the first ever *web 3 authenticated social network community sharing and project management website.* A niche I invented btw. This first ever, one of a kind W3ASNCSPMW^(for short) was carefully and meticulously crafted with the deepest love for EVM\u2019s and cubs, as I am madly in love with all of them. This community can only be accessed by pseudo anonymous web3 wallet login currently. All information in the community is not indexable by search engines, and all accounts can only be created with a web3 wallet, NO EMAIL! NO PASSWORDS! NO MONEY DOWN! NO CREDIT CHECKS! For now anyway, bigger plans ahead.\n\n*What\u2019s it got so far?*\n\nHere's just a few highlights with much more community building & revenue generating functionality to come. Public forums, public/private/hidden groups, user to user private messaging, KB Docs,^(wiki) job board, p2p classifieds system. Each of those has some amazing features as well! Like waaay too f\u2019ing many to list, but since you know I love to write long winded ass posts I\u2019m going to cover *just* the highlights for you below\n\n*Anyone can join and be a member of this cutting edge, purpose built community?*\n\nYes. Of course. Next question please.\n\n**For EVM\u2019s, you get some extras for being in the pride like:**\n\n-\tAbility to create your own groups (public,private,hidden)\n-\tAbility to create posts on the EVM blog (promo your projects)\n-\tAbility to create knowledgebase^(wiki) articles (help docs for your project)\n-\tAbility to post classified ads (sell your NFT\u2019s, bicycle parts, whatever)\n-\tAbility to post to the job board (recruit or hire people for your project)\n-\tA cool EVM badge on your profile (may remove this if privacy is a concern)\n-\tComing Soon: Ability for EVMs to create courses/lessons/video tuts and sell them individually or in memberships.\n\nFor non-EVM\u2019s you can still comment, post and share on all the public groups and forums. You can even request to join private groups. You can make connections, follow members, store photos/files, etc\u2026\n\n**Group Features**\n\n-\tGroup organizers can assign moderators for certain tasks\n-\tGroup timeline ala Facebook \u2013 searchable\n-\tGroup videos/photos/album sharing storage\n-\tGroup file/document storage\n-\tGroup Project Management Tool\n  - Create unlimited projects\n  - Create unlimited tasks\n  - Create automated recurring tasks\n  - Set milestones, due dates, etc\n  - Create Kanban Boards\n  - Create Gannt Charts\n  - Attach files to project\n  - Assign tasks to group members\n  - Branded Invoice creation\n  - Invoice payment through YOUR Paypal/Stripe API key w/ automatic project update to \u201cpaid\u201d\n-\tComing soon: Group sub-groups\n-\tComing soon: group event calendars w/ group reminders\n\n**Forum Features**\n\n-\tForum organizers can assign moderators\n-\tAttach Photos/Videos to post, shown inline\n-\tAttach files to post\n-\tNested replies (10 deep)\n-\tEmoji support \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb\n-\tSticky posts\n-\tSubscribe to threads\n-\tFavorite posts\n-\tPost edit logging & revision histories\n\nYour username is your public wallet address. Edit your profile to provide as much or as little information as you\u2019d like. ALL of these are optional and are blank by default, and all of them can be set to public, private or \u201conly me.\u201d\n\n-\tSet \u201cNickname\u201d or \u201cHandle\u201d that will be shown publicly in place of your wallet address.\n-\tSet profile photo\n-\tSet profile cover photo\n-\tSet social media links\n-\tAbout me section\n-\tSet phone number\n-\tSkills section\n-\tSet email address\n-\tAbility to set permissions on all items to \u201cPublic, Connections^(friends), or Only Me\u201d\n-\tPersonal file/docs/photos/videos/albums storage. Make items public, or private. Share with other members on the forums, groups, private messages or anywhere on the site!\n-\tActivity feed, ala facebook\n-\tAbility to tag other members in timeline/groups/messages & forum posts with @NICKNAME. Site wide, across all sections!\n-\tAbility to private message other members\n-\tPrivate messages groups (multiple members)\n-\tPhoto/file/video sharing in private messages (embeds inline)\n-\tAbility to follow other members (their posts show in your feed)\n-\tAbility to connect to^(friend) other members\n-\tAbility to block other members\n-\tControl over who can connect with you, who can PM you, etc\u2026\n-\tExport your account/profile for backup/restore\n\n**Timeline Features**\n\nBasically everything facebook has. There is only one reaction, a \u201clike\u201d for now. You can set profile & posts to public/connections/only me. As much as I don\u2019t like FB I have to admit their UI team is extremely effective at creating a format that is easy to follow and drives engagement. It\u2019s familiar to most as well, that\u2019s why it\u2019s that way. ALL OF THE UI CAN BE EASILY CHANGED THOUGH! It\u2019s just a front end to a platform.\n\n**Other notable features**\n\n-\tRanking system based on contribution, currently I have strata\u2019s (ranks) 1-10 for non-EVM\u2019s and strata\u2019s 1-3 for EVM\u2019s.\n-\tPoints based system (duqets). Of no value currently other than personal pride. In the future these may be redeemable for coupons or items, or maybe used to buy additional site privileges, like the ability to create groups for non EVMs.\n-\tTrophy Award system for achievements (none currently configured)\n-\tAwards automatically unlocked on completing activity requirements\n-\tDesktop style notification system (on by default) w/ user option for browser notifications\n-\tNo email notifications by default. You can add an email address to your profile and enable them if you wish.\n-\tJob board. This may work better as a \u201cproject\u201d board for people looking to join their projects. This will probably change a little with your feedback! I believe if desired I can also import an indeed.com feed for just crypto/web3 jobs in here and update it daily with cron as well\n-\tClassifieds system. Currently this is P2P only, but if it becomes popular we could charge a small one time fee to list something. Similar to some craigslist categories. Currently its a free for all.\n-\tInline GIPHY animated GIF support :)\n\n**Privacy**\n\nSince you can log in with your crypto wallet, your identity is as anonymous as you want it to be. You\u2019re in control to provide as little or as much info as you want. Site gets hacked? No worries, its just a bunch of wallet addresses. Export your profile, move your assets to a new wallet, log back in and import your profile. Your back in business. No need to go changing all your email addresses and passwords.\n\nWith all that said, I as the site admin, do have access to everything. I can tell you however that I will respect your privacy. The admin account will only be used for admin stuff. There is no easy \u201cpoint and click\u201d interface on the backend to access your private messages or anything. I\u2019d have to go digging through millions of SQL tables and then figure out what scheme they're hashed with and dehash them ALL to find one. That\u2019s too much work for me, especially for something I don't care about, honestly. Your business is your business. You have my word. I know that\u2019s not a guarantee, but if you know me, you know I highly value freedom and privacy. \n\nI view those as \u201chuman rights\u201d that should not be violated. You also know, I have no room to judge you, and you also know my memory is shot, so I will forget about it 5 minutes later anyway. Plus, no one will believe me anyway. I will however be required to assist any law enforcement agencies (with a warrant!) demanding information, so you know \u2026 keep it legal.\n\n*Ok, sir, this sounds like something I\u2019d be kind interested in but what\u2019s it gonna cost me?*\n\nNothing. It\u2019s free. Like, really. All it is missing is YOU!\n\n*Free!? What\u2019s the catch?*\n\nNo catch. Honestly, I just want to contribute to this community that has helped me so much. I want to re-invest some of the money the people here have helped me make, back into the community. I don\u2019t know what else I can do to help, but I am pretty good at building websites and fostering community so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. This also gives me an excuse to collaborate with developers and other people I know in the web 2.0 field and promote web3 ideals and integration with existing products there as well. The developer of the web3 auth plugin has already included several of my ideas into her product and continues to be open to new ideas. This is just another way we win hearts and minds!\n\nI also believe we have grown as a community and we need a website outside the walls of Reddit & Discord. One where we can interact with the public on our terms and provide a learning format they may be willing to pay for. The DAO/EVM needs money if we are going to ever do all the great things we talk about wanting to do. We need real world revenue generating assets ... like a community website.\n\nwow ... reddit has a character limit? Huh ... well if you're still here I finished up in the comments below...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ayo! My normally attractive pride! Looking totally like you today! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb I apologize up front for the length of this post ... but you know ... ban me if you don&#39;t like it or whatever. I&#39;m still working on my site but I wanted to leak a some more details, get some juices flowing and see if anyone else is interested in helping. Please PM me.</p>\n\n<p><em>Oh god John! What have you done!?</em></p>\n\n<p>I have had this vision for a community website since before the EVM launched. Then the EVM launched and all these new thoughts started banging around in my head. Here&#39;s the tldr; though: I believe it is time for us all to have a home outside these walls. Since getting my words to show what I want in your brains is hard, I created <strong><em>Caches</em></strong><sup>PM me to try it out</sup></p>\n\n<p>Reposted from the Caches forums:</p>\n\n<p><em>What is caches?</em></p>\n\n<p>Caches is my greatest work. No but seriously, it is the first ever <em>web 3 authenticated social network community sharing and project management website.</em> A niche I invented btw. This first ever, one of a kind W3ASNCSPMW<sup>for short</sup> was carefully and meticulously crafted with the deepest love for EVM\u2019s and cubs, as I am madly in love with all of them. This community can only be accessed by pseudo anonymous web3 wallet login currently. All information in the community is not indexable by search engines, and all accounts can only be created with a web3 wallet, NO EMAIL! NO PASSWORDS! NO MONEY DOWN! NO CREDIT CHECKS! For now anyway, bigger plans ahead.</p>\n\n<p><em>What\u2019s it got so far?</em></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s just a few highlights with much more community building &amp; revenue generating functionality to come. Public forums, public/private/hidden groups, user to user private messaging, KB Docs,<sup>wiki</sup> job board, p2p classifieds system. Each of those has some amazing features as well! Like waaay too f\u2019ing many to list, but since you know I love to write long winded ass posts I\u2019m going to cover <em>just</em> the highlights for you below</p>\n\n<p><em>Anyone can join and be a member of this cutting edge, purpose built community?</em></p>\n\n<p>Yes. Of course. Next question please.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For EVM\u2019s, you get some extras for being in the pride like:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Ability to create your own groups (public,private,hidden)</li>\n<li>  Ability to create posts on the EVM blog (promo your projects)</li>\n<li>  Ability to create knowledgebase<sup>wiki</sup> articles (help docs for your project)</li>\n<li>  Ability to post classified ads (sell your NFT\u2019s, bicycle parts, whatever)</li>\n<li>  Ability to post to the job board (recruit or hire people for your project)</li>\n<li>  A cool EVM badge on your profile (may remove this if privacy is a concern)</li>\n<li>  Coming Soon: Ability for EVMs to create courses/lessons/video tuts and sell them individually or in memberships.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For non-EVM\u2019s you can still comment, post and share on all the public groups and forums. You can even request to join private groups. You can make connections, follow members, store photos/files, etc\u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>Group Features</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Group organizers can assign moderators for certain tasks</li>\n<li>  Group timeline ala Facebook \u2013 searchable</li>\n<li>  Group videos/photos/album sharing storage</li>\n<li>  Group file/document storage</li>\n<li>  Group Project Management Tool\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create unlimited projects</li>\n<li>Create unlimited tasks</li>\n<li>Create automated recurring tasks</li>\n<li>Set milestones, due dates, etc</li>\n<li>Create Kanban Boards</li>\n<li>Create Gannt Charts</li>\n<li>Attach files to project</li>\n<li>Assign tasks to group members</li>\n<li>Branded Invoice creation</li>\n<li>Invoice payment through YOUR Paypal/Stripe API key w/ automatic project update to \u201cpaid\u201d</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>  Coming soon: Group sub-groups</li>\n<li>  Coming soon: group event calendars w/ group reminders</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Forum Features</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Forum organizers can assign moderators</li>\n<li>  Attach Photos/Videos to post, shown inline</li>\n<li>  Attach files to post</li>\n<li>  Nested replies (10 deep)</li>\n<li>  Emoji support \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb</li>\n<li>  Sticky posts</li>\n<li>  Subscribe to threads</li>\n<li>  Favorite posts</li>\n<li>  Post edit logging &amp; revision histories</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your username is your public wallet address. Edit your profile to provide as much or as little information as you\u2019d like. ALL of these are optional and are blank by default, and all of them can be set to public, private or \u201conly me.\u201d</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Set \u201cNickname\u201d or \u201cHandle\u201d that will be shown publicly in place of your wallet address.</li>\n<li>  Set profile photo</li>\n<li>  Set profile cover photo</li>\n<li>  Set social media links</li>\n<li>  About me section</li>\n<li>  Set phone number</li>\n<li>  Skills section</li>\n<li>  Set email address</li>\n<li>  Ability to set permissions on all items to \u201cPublic, Connections<sup>friends</sup>, or Only Me\u201d</li>\n<li>  Personal file/docs/photos/videos/albums storage. Make items public, or private. Share with other members on the forums, groups, private messages or anywhere on the site!</li>\n<li>  Activity feed, ala facebook</li>\n<li>  Ability to tag other members in timeline/groups/messages &amp; forum posts with @NICKNAME. Site wide, across all sections!</li>\n<li>  Ability to private message other members</li>\n<li>  Private messages groups (multiple members)</li>\n<li>  Photo/file/video sharing in private messages (embeds inline)</li>\n<li>  Ability to follow other members (their posts show in your feed)</li>\n<li>  Ability to connect to<sup>friend</sup> other members</li>\n<li>  Ability to block other members</li>\n<li>  Control over who can connect with you, who can PM you, etc\u2026</li>\n<li>  Export your account/profile for backup/restore</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Timeline Features</strong></p>\n\n<p>Basically everything facebook has. There is only one reaction, a \u201clike\u201d for now. You can set profile &amp; posts to public/connections/only me. As much as I don\u2019t like FB I have to admit their UI team is extremely effective at creating a format that is easy to follow and drives engagement. It\u2019s familiar to most as well, that\u2019s why it\u2019s that way. ALL OF THE UI CAN BE EASILY CHANGED THOUGH! It\u2019s just a front end to a platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other notable features</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Ranking system based on contribution, currently I have strata\u2019s (ranks) 1-10 for non-EVM\u2019s and strata\u2019s 1-3 for EVM\u2019s.</li>\n<li>  Points based system (duqets). Of no value currently other than personal pride. In the future these may be redeemable for coupons or items, or maybe used to buy additional site privileges, like the ability to create groups for non EVMs.</li>\n<li>  Trophy Award system for achievements (none currently configured)</li>\n<li>  Awards automatically unlocked on completing activity requirements</li>\n<li>  Desktop style notification system (on by default) w/ user option for browser notifications</li>\n<li>  No email notifications by default. You can add an email address to your profile and enable them if you wish.</li>\n<li>  Job board. This may work better as a \u201cproject\u201d board for people looking to join their projects. This will probably change a little with your feedback! I believe if desired I can also import an indeed.com feed for just crypto/web3 jobs in here and update it daily with cron as well</li>\n<li>  Classifieds system. Currently this is P2P only, but if it becomes popular we could charge a small one time fee to list something. Similar to some craigslist categories. Currently its a free for all.</li>\n<li>  Inline GIPHY animated GIF support :)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since you can log in with your crypto wallet, your identity is as anonymous as you want it to be. You\u2019re in control to provide as little or as much info as you want. Site gets hacked? No worries, its just a bunch of wallet addresses. Export your profile, move your assets to a new wallet, log back in and import your profile. Your back in business. No need to go changing all your email addresses and passwords.</p>\n\n<p>With all that said, I as the site admin, do have access to everything. I can tell you however that I will respect your privacy. The admin account will only be used for admin stuff. There is no easy \u201cpoint and click\u201d interface on the backend to access your private messages or anything. I\u2019d have to go digging through millions of SQL tables and then figure out what scheme they&#39;re hashed with and dehash them ALL to find one. That\u2019s too much work for me, especially for something I don&#39;t care about, honestly. Your business is your business. You have my word. I know that\u2019s not a guarantee, but if you know me, you know I highly value freedom and privacy. </p>\n\n<p>I view those as \u201chuman rights\u201d that should not be violated. You also know, I have no room to judge you, and you also know my memory is shot, so I will forget about it 5 minutes later anyway. Plus, no one will believe me anyway. I will however be required to assist any law enforcement agencies (with a warrant!) demanding information, so you know \u2026 keep it legal.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ok, sir, this sounds like something I\u2019d be kind interested in but what\u2019s it gonna cost me?</em></p>\n\n<p>Nothing. It\u2019s free. Like, really. All it is missing is YOU!</p>\n\n<p><em>Free!? What\u2019s the catch?</em></p>\n\n<p>No catch. Honestly, I just want to contribute to this community that has helped me so much. I want to re-invest some of the money the people here have helped me make, back into the community.

Far fetched, I know, but think about it, no one knows who the reddit admins are or who at Reddit has the admin power. Same goes for Discord. There are 80,000+ people in here, what if Reddit just decided to terminate our lease? We would be disbanded so fast, with no \"meet up\" spot. Poof! Gone! *Noooo!* We need to own our home. It's time!\n\nI will be working with the web3 dev going forward to try to integrate layered NFT permissions so that I am not the only Admin, but also in a way that respects everyones privacy. What\u2019s cool is if we test this plugin for her, she\u2019ll give us a free lifetime license. Win/win/win. She\u2019s brilliant, effective and a go-getter. So maybe I can convince her to buy an EVM, or maybe through recordable and awardable contributions through a community site, OUR site, she can earn one. \ud83d\ude09 Maybe we can easily mint a EVM2.0 NFT on our own website to bring more people into the pride. SOOO many options here y'all!\n\nI hope this can become the old-fashioned Web 2.0 presence for EVM\u2019s outside of the masters gates, with fancy web 3.0 door to really bring the room together. I also hope this can become a platform for EVM\u2019s to earn some money, help people learn about Web 3.0, and share their ideals. There are a ton of revenue opportunities with this platform without needing a single ad sponsor. \n\nI believe Ethereum and Web 3.0 will impact more than just the finance and economics. Systems like voting, identity, value assessment, governmental/organizational structure, and \u2026 well you know me \u2026 lets just say many more. I believe that means we need people from all areas of study, everyone! From economists to psychologists to developers to game theorists to rocket scientists to tradesmen, sanitation engineers, housewives/husbands and McD\u2019s fry cooks.\n\nIf you are going to make a system that is as fair, equitable, accountable and honest as possible, you need everyone's input on a variety of subjects. *This is the gwei.* That means our own place, where we can group and categorize and store things. Files, links, documents, etc\u2026 in an easily searchable & repostable, shareable way, across all our channels. Sure we could setup a \u201cnext cloud,\u201d but as a wanna-be data scientist I can say that finding just the right thing you need, when you need it, is all in the meta. Tags, the context language around what you\u2019re really looking for, the little tidbits hidden in PDF metadata, that\u2019s how you quickly and easily find what you want when all you can remember is one little sentence from a DOCX you read a few years ago. That\u2019s where the social aspect comes in, because in the natural course of just talking, sharing ideas, collaborating, helping each other out \u2026 the meta is made. Organic. No hormones, no antibiotics.\n\nI am just a one man army. I put this whole thing together in about 2 weeks start to finish including taking 1/2 a day off everyday to hike during the build out. The first week or so was just banging a flow around in my head before trying to put all the legos together. I honestly believe with the help of the EVM/ETHFinance community we can make this place fantastic and make a place everyone can earn money from. \n\n**I don\u2019t even need to be an admin**, the ETHFi mods do a fantastic job and I would love to see them continue that over here, and be rewarded for it, and build a website and platform that generates a decent living not just for themselves, but others too\u2026 all while pushing the DAO\u2019s mission of web3 education forward. I want to feed the pride, because a hungry lion is a dangerous lion. A hungry lion will leave the pride in search of food if they get too hungry. Know what I'm sayin? I love these people and I don't want to see this thing disintegrate because everyone's just tryna eat. Honestly. Truly. This is made from love and fear of losing that love. Also, it could add some nice \"extrinsic value\" to owning an EVM, thus making them more valuable on the market. Phiz. \ud83d\ude09\n\nWith all that said, if this grows, it will eventually need funding. I hope the DAO can assist so I don\u2019t have to rely on advertising. I also have a few other ideas I\u2019m tossing around if it comes to that point. Until then, I don\u2019t mind paying the bills, and it would be an honor to have made something that my peeps find valuable and useful. My #1 goal for the site will be to help EVM's make some money or push your projects forward. I believe this site can help incentivize EVMs to educate the public on web3/ETH, and be paid for that if they choose to. I hope you understand this isn\u2019t some trick or anything, this is genuine from the real human behind the very dramatic JBM character on Reddit.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t want to be in charge here, no more than anyone else probably wants me to either. I just have been yelling about doing this for a while, no one was doing it the way I envisioned it, so I did it myself. So I am willing to share my control, or even turn over control for this thing. If it helps push the DAO\u2019s mission statement forward and we all can earn some money for the DAO and ourselves, as well as build the ManeNet/EVM brand as trustworthy in an untrustworthy world, I will step aside.\n\n*A little EVM weaving through time*\n\nWe've got a lot more kids now and this ol' Reddit house is feeling kinda cramped.
