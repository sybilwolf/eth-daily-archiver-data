Products and marketing that would never be allowed on today\u2019s Wall Street\u2014thanks to a century of financial regulations\u2014found homes in crypto. The industry is now packed with Wall Street alumni, traders, and others from the financial industry.\r  \n\r  \nThe heads of major companies such as Galaxy Digital Holdings GLXY \u201310.39%  (GLXY.Canada), Grayscale Investments, and Genesis Trading all worked on Wall Street before coming to crypto. At Coinbase Global COIN +4.30%  (COIN), the head of global financial operations came from Goldman Sachs. Celsius was founded by Alex Mashinsky, a serial tech entrepreneur, but its senior team includes alumni of Royal Bank of Canada, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nOne of the largest equity market makers, Jane Street Capital, is part of the crypto plumbing, providing liquidity to exchanges like Robinhood Markets (HOOD) and trading crypto for itself. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in crypto is a pretty wonderful sandbox for a lot of different experiments,\u201d said Thomas Uhm, a member of Jane Street\u2019s crypto sales and trading team, on a podcast in February.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nWithout a regulator like the SEC in charge, crypto companies set many of their own rules. Industrywide listing requirements for tokens don\u2019t exist. Binance.US lists more than 100 tokens, from ApeCoin to Zilliqa. Coinbase offers around 170 tokens, including some issued by entities that the company\u2019s own venture-capital arm has funded. Coinbase says its token investments don\u2019t influence listings.\r  \n\r  \nCrypto traders aren\u2019t just going up against sophisticated investors like hedge funds or high-frequency trading firms. They may be trading against companies that act as their broker, custodian, market maker, and exchange\u2014all rolled into one entity.\r  \n\r  \nMarket makers, stock exchanges, and brokerages have long been separated on Wall Street due to conflicts of interest that would arise if they handled it all\u2014such as making it possible to trade against their own customers or front-run orders. In crypto, that separation often doesn\u2019t exist, leaving investors vulnerable, according to regulators such as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere\u2019s no prohibition against wash-trading on crypto exchanges, no prohibition against proprietary trading, no best-execution rules, and no standardized reporting,\u201d says Timothy Massad, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s this whole lack of a framework where you can\u2019t compare it to securities that concerns me.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nCrypto trading platforms say some of the concerns are overblown or stem from a lack of clarity around the rules. A Coinbase representative said the company doesn\u2019t trade against customers or act as a market maker. \u201cWe will continue to call for a regulatory framework for the crypto-economy that ensures consumer protections and expands access for all,\u201d the representative said in a statement.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMany exchanges serve multiple functions out of necessity as the industry is still in its infancy,\u201d Binance said in a statement to Barron\u2019s. \u201cAs a leading exchange, Binance takes user protection and responsible trading seriously.\u201d FTX declined to comment.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nYet centralized exchanges account for only some of the trading. Billions of dollars worth of crypto also sits on decentralized finance, or DeFi, platforms. Traders, borrowers, and lenders set their own terms in DeFi, matched by algorithms or software protocols that automate all aspects of a transaction. Positions may be automatically liquidated if collateral levels fall below preset thresholds.\r  \n\r  \nInvestors often plow money into DeFi to capture advertised double-digit or even triple-digit yields. Nothing like that exists in traditional finance\u2014bank savings rates now hit 1.6% at best. Junk bond yields average 8%. But in DeFi, since there aren\u2019t companies standing behind the trading and borrowing protocols, there\u2019s scant recourse if deposits vanish due to a hack or software glitch.\r  \n\r  \nTheft on DeFi isn\u2019t trivial. Protocols accounted for 97% of the $1.7 billion of crypto stolen in 2022 as of May 1, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. \u201cIt\u2019s a major consumer protection issue that you don\u2019t have recourse if you have funds stolen on DeFi,\u201d says Chainalysis Director of Research Kim Grauer, adding that she\u2019s optimistic protocols will get more secure over time.\r  \n\r  \nWith stablecoins, crypto is reinventing financial wallpaper that started in the 1970s: the money-market fund. Stablecoins, like money-market funds, aim to maintain a fixed $1 price. But unlike regulated funds, stablecoins can own whatever assets they want as reserves, including other tokens like Bitcoin.\r  \n\r  \nThe perils of this approach became apparent with the recent crash of an \u201calgorithmic\u201d stablecoin called TerraUSD, wiping out $60 billion in a few weeks. The episode highlighted the system\u2019s fragility and contagion risks as Tether, the largest stablecoin, briefly \u201cbroke the buck,\u201d raising concerns that the industry wasn\u2019t prepared for a classic run on the bank.\r  \n\r  \nThe term stablecoin is \u201can effective marketing strategy but could really hurt if the stablecoin were to fail,\u201d says Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who has written critically about crypto. Money-market funds have broken the buck in stressful markets, such as the 2008 financial crisis, requiring bailouts and market stabilization measures, she adds. In stablecoins, owners of the tokens don\u2019t even have ironclad redemption rights, let alone a federal backstop.\r  \n\r  \nCrypto companies are elbowing into another Wall Street club: home loans. Start-ups like Milo are offering zero-down mortgages, backed by crypto as collateral. The company, along with others, aims to chip off even a tiny slice of the multitrillion-dollar home loan market. Some traditional mortgages have already been traded on a blockchain. Securitizing crypto mortgages may be next. \u201cWe talk to a number of regulators and are trying to get them to understand what we\u2019re doing,\u201d says Milo CEO Josip Rupena.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>PART 2</p>\n\n<p>Lenders and brokers with exposure to 3AC included Voyager Digital VOYG \u201317.14%  (VOYG.Canada), which said in a news release that 3AC defaulted on a $675 million loan consisting of Bitcoin and USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar.

But in DeFi, since there aren\u2019t companies standing behind the trading and borrowing protocols, there\u2019s scant recourse if deposits vanish due to a hack or software glitch.</p>\n\n<p>Theft on DeFi isn\u2019t trivial. Protocols accounted for 97% of the $1.7 billion of crypto stolen in 2022 as of May 1, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. \u201cIt\u2019s a major consumer protection issue that you don\u2019t have recourse if you have funds stolen on DeFi,\u201d says Chainalysis Director of Research Kim Grauer, adding that she\u2019s optimistic protocols will get more secure over time.</p>\n\n<p>With stablecoins, crypto is reinventing financial wallpaper that started in the 1970s: the money-market fund. Stablecoins, like money-market funds, aim to maintain a fixed $1 price. But unlike regulated funds, stablecoins can own whatever assets they want as reserves, including other tokens like Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>The perils of this approach became apparent with the recent crash of an \u201calgorithmic\u201d stablecoin called TerraUSD, wiping out $60 billion in a few weeks. The episode highlighted the system\u2019s fragility and contagion risks as Tether, the largest stablecoin, briefly \u201cbroke the buck,\u201d raising concerns that the industry wasn\u2019t prepared for a classic run on the bank.</p>\n\n<p>The term stablecoin is \u201can effective marketing strategy but could really hurt if the stablecoin were to fail,\u201d says Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who has written critically about crypto. Money-market funds have broken the buck in stressful markets, such as the 2008 financial crisis, requiring bailouts and market stabilization measures, she adds. In stablecoins, owners of the tokens don\u2019t even have ironclad redemption rights, let alone a federal backstop.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto companies are elbowing into another Wall Street club: home loans. Start-ups like Milo are offering zero-down mortgages, backed by crypto as collateral. The company, along with others, aims to chip off even a tiny slice of the multitrillion-dollar home loan market. Some traditional mortgages have already been traded on a blockchain. Securitizing crypto mortgages may be next. \u201cWe talk to a number of regulators and are trying to get them to understand what we\u2019re doing,\u201d says Milo CEO Josip Rupena.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-02 10:09:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ieliguy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vpjzog","parent_id":"t1_ieli62v","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/oblomov1","body":"PART 3\n\nThe Crypto  \nFinancial Machine  \nTo understand why Bitcoin purists object to all this, it\u2019s helpful to know some history.  \nBitcoin, launched in 2009, was developed as a peer-to-peer system for transferring a currency without using intermediaries like banks. The technology, dubbed \u201cpermissionless,\u201d was designed as if corporations and governments were the enemy of individual economic rights.  \nYet the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014a network of computers whirring endlessly to solve math problems that validate transactions\u2014wasn\u2019t built to scale up. Transaction processing is glacial compared with card networks like Visa (V). Nor was the blockchain designed for uses beyond payments. That opened the floodgates to other blockchains. Today, hundreds of them form the backbones for trading platforms, tokens, financial products, videogames, and online worlds.  \nCrypto also took advantage of a lack of regulation to raise capital and set up corporate structures on its own terms. Rather than issuing equity, blockchain companies would raise money from venture capital and then airdrop tokens\u2014distributing them free to build support\u2014or engage in an \u201cinitial coin offering.\u201d Exchanges and brokerage firms received state licenses to operate as money-transfer businesses, partly because there was no clear path to register the business or tokens with the SEC.  \nEarly inefficiencies in the market lured Wall Street veterans. Take Dave Weisberger, who worked on quantitative trading and market structure at firms like Salomon Brothers and Two Sigma Securities. Weisberger went on to co-found a firm called CoinRoutes that imports crypto market data from dozens of exchanges.  \nIn a presentation at a crypto event in October, Weisberger said the crypto markets had \u201cplenty of dumb traders for you to see on the tape and take advantage of.\u201d Crypto, he added, offers \u201cso much more inefficiency than other markets that it\u2019s very exciting. It\u2019s one of the reasons that so many traders are flocking to it.\u201d  \nWith more sophisticated firms now in the space, market efficiency is improving, Weisberger said in an interview. But retail traders aren\u2019t getting anything close to the national \u201cbest execution\u201d standard for equity trades, according to Massad. A small investor on Coinbase is trading only against other investors or market makers on the platform. Institutional investors use firms like CoinRoutes to send orders to whatever exchange offers the best price.  \nMoreover, there\u2019s also more arbitrage opportunity in crypto. A hedge fund could buy Bitcoin on one platform and sell it at a higher price on another, or use publicly traded equities and spot crypto markets to make that bet. That type of trade is much tougher to pull off in stocks, where bid/ask spreads are generally tight and prices don\u2019t deviate much across national exchanges.  \n\u201cIn equity markets, retail gets the best deal,\u201d says Weisberger. \u201cIn crypto, generally retail traders pay higher fees or trade outside of where the actual spread is.\u201d  \nCrypto Loans and Mortgages  \nThe crypto crash has been a wake-up call, even for people in the industry who thought they weren\u2019t taking big risks by taking out a loan.  \nShahar Abrams is one such investor. A 30-year-old industry consultant, he had taken out a $140,000 loan last December with Celsius. As collateral, he had posted $560,000 worth of a token called CEL, a proprietary coin originally issued by the company. He used the proceeds to help buy a condo and grand piano. \u201cMy dream piano and a place to put it,\u201d said Abrams, who lives in Atlanta.  \nWhat he didn\u2019t expect was a collapse of his collateral. As Terra plunged, prices sank for other tokens. CEL\u2019s price halved in one day and fell another 50% the next. That prompted a margin call from Celsius to post more collateral within 24 hours. Abrams decided not to throw more money into it, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Celsius liquidated his collateral to repay the loan before its own deadline. In the end, borrowing against his collateral instead of selling it cost him about $420,000.  \n\u201cClearly there\u2019s a lot more risk to the platform than people realized,\u201d says Abrams, who consulted for Celsius and recommended it to friends. \u201cI always thought Celsius was the absolute safest one, and that\u2019s why I steered people there.\u201d  \nCelsius and other lenders now face a regulatory storm. Even before the company seized up, it had been accused by state regulators of violating securities laws and had stopped offering its interest accounts to new U.S. retail investors. Regulators in at least five states are probing its deposit freeze. Celsius in legal proceedings has disputed that it violated securities laws and has said it is \u201cworking closely with U.S. states to provide clarity about our business operations.\u201d  \nOther crypto lenders sound undeterred, arguing that they\u2019re safeguarding depositors while meeting demand for loans that banks won\u2019t provide.  \nLedn, a lender based in Toronto, says its typical borrower doesn\u2019t want to sell his or her Bitcoin, and can\u2019t find a traditional lender. \u201cWith Bitcoin, we can offer people in Mexico a loan at the same interest rate that a client in Canada or the U.S. can get,\u201d says Ledn co-founder Mauricio Di Bartolomeo. The typical loan is for $15,000, he says, used for things like buying a home or school tuition.  \nLedn also advertises high-yield savings accounts, including 7.5% on the stablecoin USD Coin and 5.25% on Bitcoin. Di Bartolomeo says that liquidations and withdrawals have increased recently, but he\u2019s confident the platform can weather the crisis.  \nCompanies like Milo, the mortgage lender, say they\u2019re issuing home loans to the \u201ccrypto-rich,\u201d providing credit they couldn\u2019t get through a traditional lender. Milo doesn\u2019t check credit scores or require much income and asset documentation, other than requirements for anti-money-laundering purposes. And while few banks take crypto as collateral, Milo bases its loans on a borrower\u2019s Bitcoin or other crypto holdings.  \nRupena, who founded Milo after working on Wall Street, says a home buyer can put zero down for a loan. A borrower could get a $1 million mortgage for a house priced at $1 million, backed by $1 million worth of Bitcoin and the house itself. If the crypto collateral drops below a preset threshold, the company could require the borrower to add more; if prices continue to drop and the borrower doesn\u2019t add more crypto, Milo may liquidate the collateral or foreclose on the property.  \nFor now, traditional lenders like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Rocket Cos.\u2019 (RKT) Rocket Mortgage don\u2019t have much to fear. The crypto-rich market is small. Milo issued its first mortgage in April, funding a set of rental properties in Coral Gables, Fla., secured with Ether and Bitcoin, then worth around $600,000. Since then, Milo says it has closed about $10 million in loans.  \nIf zero-down mortgages take off, they would revive a product that evaporated for most buyers after the 2008 financial crisis. Rupena was in his early 20s back then, following a stint as an intern on Lehman Brothers\u2019 mortgage desk. That experience taught him to \u201cthink about the world a little differently and the downside in a different lens,\u201d he said, adding that the company hasn\u2019t had to issue any margin calls as the crypto market crashed.  \nFinancial Innovation or Unregulated Casino?  \nCrypto industry executives say many of their innovations will make finance faster, cheaper, and more accessible. When an investor buys or sells a stock, for example, it typically takes two business days for the transaction to settle. Crypto transactions are often completed within minutes, once they\u2019re recorded on a blockchain.  \nTraditional cross-border payments can be even more burdensome, requiring multiple banks to coordinate transfers over several days or wire transfer services that charge steep transaction and currency-exchange fees. International crypto payments happen almost immediately, wallet-to-wallet, and may be less costly.  \n\u201cUse of the blockchain and distributed ledgers definitely brings efficiency to many financial products and processes. There\u2019s no doubt that that\u2019s the case,\u201d says former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, now an advisor at crypto firm Fireblocks and senior policy advisor at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. The issue, Clayton says, is that some in the industry don\u2019t so much want clearer rules of the road as they don\u2019t want to obey what\u2019s on the books: \u201cThe calls for so-called clarity in many ways are just calls to change the applicable law.\u201d  \nSome software engineers say it\u2019s high time for governments to take charge.  \nBitcoin \u201cwas this financial populist movement as a reaction to the speculative excesses of Wall Street,\u201d says Stephen Diehl, one such critic now urging Congress to crack down. \u201cImagine if Occupy Wall Street was an equivalent movement,\u201d he said, referring to the populist protest against income inequality. \u201cNow, imagine if everyone on Occupy Wall Street was replaced with a hedge fund manager.

I just got off the phone with Chase bank and I am getting back roughly 60% of the money I deposited into Voyager, so hope this helps some of you.\n\nOne way to get your money back if you funded Celsius or Voyager account using ACH is to call your bank and tell them you want to dispute the transaction.  REG-E which was implemented to the ETFA (electronic funds transfer act) allows consumers to \u201crevoke consent\u201d after making a debit via ACH.
