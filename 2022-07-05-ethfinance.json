My prysm-besu validator successfully attested during this epoch, but failed to produce a block - presumably because it contained deposits.  besu <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3921\">has an issue</a> tracking this, and the current fix is to <code>rm caches/*.cache</code>. In looking through the prysm log, I <a href=\"https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/10994\">discovered a bug</a> in their pruning of invalid blocks.  All besu pairs except for lodestar-besu are now complaining about a mismatch in terminal block hash between the EL and CL.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-05 21:15:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"if19pni","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vrq1kf","parent_id":"t3_vrq1kf","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/wordlemcgee","body":"Thanks for your diligence!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for your diligence!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-06 01:18:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"if1tz9i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vrq1kf","parent_id":"t1_if19pni","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Got my second proposal last night!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Got my second proposal last night!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-05 05:13:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iexm8uk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vrq1kf","parent_id":"t3_vrq1kf","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Dog_The_Explorer","body":"Did you say yes this time?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Did you say yes this time?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-05 05:52:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iexqb7z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vrq1kf","parent_id":"t1_iexm8uk","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I love when men fight over me, so of course not :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I love when men fight over me, so of course not :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-05 05:56:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iexqtmw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vrq1kf","parent_id":"t1_iexqb7z","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/pr0nh0li0","body":"I got my 38th proposal yesterday.

So all that will be left is the EVM/Member blog, knowledgebase,^wiki the public forums, and any user created groups.

In the meantime, EVM or not, if you want to help me make this place great, sign up, edit your profile, change your nickname, and send me a short private message on caches (@JBM) letting me know what you're good at.

I gave them the scenario (Ethereum, staking, locked rewards, etc) and they asked me to leave it with them. They contacted me sometime after and their words were \"it is taxable income at the time the tokens are derived.\"\n\nI put forward the argument I see quite often, and said that the tokens have not been \"derived\" or \"received\" if they are locked and cannot be accessed. They said that from a tax perspective that does not change anything, the Ethereum that is being staked is a \"capital asset\" and it is being used to create more Ethereum, and you must add the staking rewards as taxable income at the time the new coins are created.\n\nSo that was the conclusion from my conversation with them. It is taxable income whether it is accessable or not.\n\nThey said the only way to get a different tax treatment on this specific topic is to submit a private ruling. In Australia the ATO doesn't write the tax legislation, they only create rulings and interpretations on it.
