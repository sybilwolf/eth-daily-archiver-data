I think that the bottom is effectively in. While we may revisit it in the coming weeks I don't think any further drops will be much deeper. Why?\n\n1. Because markets like to over react emotionally to extreme sentiment and price things in sooner. For example the covid crash and subsequent recovery were both over reactions of the current narrative at that time. The same goes for most recessions, they crash quickly and don't last long.\n\n2. In crypto there has been a great unraveling of leverage. This mostly seems to be over which means that liquidations making the price go lower should be decreasing in size and frequency.\n\n3. It's mostly been bear euphoria lately and most people aren't even bullish on the merge anymore because \"but we're in a recession now/but the macro picture is different.\" When people are telling you \"this time is different\", that's normally when they're about to get proved wrong.\n\nOnce the merge goes live, the largest reduction in issuance of a top tier crypto will happen both in percentage terms (% of total crypto issuance) and in dollar terms, both by a big margin. This is such a drastic reduction in supply, that even if demand remains low due to bearish macro markets, the price will increase as supply on exchanges dwindles.\n\nI'm sure you all want some numbers, so here's my prediction. I think that the merge will primarily affect ETH but it will also bring up all other cryptos with it, much like how Bitcoin and its halvings do. I could see a 2019 style price run where we pull up out of the bear market bottom quickly but don't breach the old all time high. Some obvious numbers I can see are a retest of our previous high and another run at a flippening. If Bitcoin rises 50% post-merge then Ethereum would be re-testing both its all-time high and the flippening at $4,800 ETH and a $30K BTC. At this point, I think profit taking would temporarily relieve the supply shortage and the then widespread narrative around a flippening would be an obvious top point where a counter trade could be made. Everyone will think that Ethereum will flip BTC but much like at $4,800 last year, the party will be over at that point.\n\nFrom there, another year or so of consolidation and ranging around below $3K while another supply shock from post-merge issuance builds up could be on the cards. Only once a new killer use case for Ethereum drives up demand for blockspace again can I see a proper run up to where Ethereum really deserves to be. That is of course 5 digits +. Just don't expect this any time soon. Give it a few years for the builders to finish building the next generation of apps.\n\nAnyway, that's my complete speculation, based on pretty much nothing but I may as well take a guess just like everyone else so I can claim the clout if I'm right. On the other hand, feel free to mock me ~~if~~ when I'm wrong.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Despite the fact that I think that price predictions and guessing what will happen in the short to mid term is a stupid game that&#39;s mostly just pure luck, I&#39;m going to share how this monkey thinks the banana market will go this year.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t see ETH going lower than $800.

This mostly seems to be over which means that liquidations making the price go lower should be decreasing in size and frequency.</p></li>\n<li><p>It&#39;s mostly been bear euphoria lately and most people aren&#39;t even bullish on the merge anymore because &quot;but we&#39;re in a recession now/but the macro picture is different.&quot; When people are telling you &quot;this time is different&quot;, that&#39;s normally when they&#39;re about to get proved wrong.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once the merge goes live, the largest reduction in issuance of a top tier crypto will happen both in percentage terms (% of total crypto issuance) and in dollar terms, both by a big margin. This is such a drastic reduction in supply, that even if demand remains low due to bearish macro markets, the price will increase as supply on exchanges dwindles.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure you all want some numbers, so here&#39;s my prediction. I think that the merge will primarily affect ETH but it will also bring up all other cryptos with it, much like how Bitcoin and its halvings do. I could see a 2019 style price run where we pull up out of the bear market bottom quickly but don&#39;t breach the old all time high. Some obvious numbers I can see are a retest of our previous high and another run at a flippening. If Bitcoin rises 50% post-merge then Ethereum would be re-testing both its all-time high and the flippening at $4,800 ETH and a $30K BTC. At this point, I think profit taking would temporarily relieve the supply shortage and the then widespread narrative around a flippening would be an obvious top point where a counter trade could be made. Everyone will think that Ethereum will flip BTC but much like at $4,800 last year, the party will be over at that point.</p>\n\n<p>From there, another year or so of consolidation and ranging around below $3K while another supply shock from post-merge issuance builds up could be on the cards. Only once a new killer use case for Ethereum drives up demand for blockspace again can I see a proper run up to where Ethereum really deserves to be. That is of course 5 digits +. Just don&#39;t expect this any time soon. Give it a few years for the builders to finish building the next generation of apps.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that&#39;s my complete speculation, based on pretty much nothing but I may as well take a guess just like everyone else so I can claim the clout if I&#39;m right. On the other hand, feel free to mock me <del>if</del> when I&#39;m wrong.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-06 02:35:03","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-07-06 03:17:53","id":"if1zcnn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vshw3m","parent_id":"t3_vshw3m","score":62,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/kenzi28","body":"I see 5 digit + I upvote.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I see 5 digit + I upvote.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-06 02:38:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"if1zlop","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vshw3m","parent_id":"t1_if1zcnn","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Yeah and that's before we talk 6 digits long term. \ud83d\udc40","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah and that&#39;s before we talk 6 digits long term. \ud83d\udc40</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-06 03:14:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"if227td","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vshw3m","parent_id":"t1_if1zlop","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/OMG_WTF_ATH","body":"6 digits is my \u201chot damn we made it\u201d moment","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>6 digits is my \u201chot damn we made it\u201d moment</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-06 05:14:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"if2cy1r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vshw3m","parent_id":"t1_if227td","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Rampager","body":"You wouldn't have that feeling at 5 digits?!

I've written about Bancor v3 and reasons to be excited about it and so naturally people asked me if this changed my opinion. There's a lot of depth to my opinion here but TLDR here's a summary:\n\n1) Everything Bancor has made is unnecessarily complex and not configurable enough. I speculate this is because of fundraising reasons (ICO) and because they didn't want BNT to be labeled a security. Some bad design elements got shoehorned in and corrupted an otherwise good product and idea.\n\n2) The implosion situation *can* be fixed but the system will need an overhaul and it will take years. I'm not taking out my liquidity and eating the loss yet but this was self-inflicted by the DAO.\n\n3) I'm not bullish on the BNT token itself even though I like the Bancor team and platform generally and love the potential of a bnAsset for Defi. Single-sided LP tokens are fundamentally a good idea even if the implementation needs some adjustments.\n\nSo to start with, here's some recap of Bancor fundamentals and how the implosion happened. Bancor is a Dex. Let's separate this product from the IL insurance product so we can break this into attackable chunks. The unique thing about their Dex is that when you become an LP you don't need to deposit asset pairs. Instead you can just deposit the assets you wish to hold. So the natural question then is when someone buys your LPd asset what are they selling you? You *have* to be paired against something. There's two ways they could have solved this, both are a hub and spoke model:\n\n1) Everything is paired against a hard asset like ETH. If there is an imbalance between ETH and pairable liquidity, then the imbalanced liquidity will sit idle in some form of deposit pool. This is potentially less capital-efficient due to the idle liquidity.\n\n2) Everything is paired against a soft asset you have control over and that you mint for each deposit. That token is BNT and is what they did.\n\nIn a world where there wasn't an ICO there could be a BNT token that no one really has any reason to buy or sell directly or even which can't be bought or sold at all. It doesn't even need to be an ERC-20. It's just an intermediate step between all assets with a market cap = TVL and a price that's sort of like being an LP of everything on the exchange. It's just a unifying hub with paired ratios so that there's something for a bonding curve to work against.\n\nEach time someone trades a token, they leave a little of the asset they are selling behind in the Dex. This is just like Uniswap, the coins left behind by the trade are claimable using the LP token. However, due to this BNT indirection there is an implicit value accrual mechanism to BNT. For illustration imagine there were only 2 pools: ETH and USDC. Both are paired against BNT. So we make up some BNT price per token (it's arbitrary) and that sets a BNT ratio for ETH and USDC. For simplicity I'm going with $1. So if ETH is $1000 at origination and there's 1 ETH of liquidity and the assets happened to be balanced then we would have 1 ETH, 1000 USDC, and 2000 BNT in the system at origination. Humble beginnings or something.\n\nNow add some crab market. Each trade leaves a little liquidity behind. After some time and accrued fees we have 2 ETH, 2000 USDC, but still 2000 BNT. BNT is only created when liquidity is deposited, not traded, and no one has a reason yet to buy or sell BNT so no BNT ever needs to be left behind. There isn't even a BNT LP at this point. Despite there being no explicit mechanism like Sushiswap where there's a platform fee, the BNT value has increased just because the BNT/ETH and BNT/USDC ratio has increased. BNT is now 'worth' $2. This is true even though no one ever bought or sold BNT. Here's where you can get greedy and where they got in trouble. The DAO can mint BNT and BNT can be sold.\n\nWho is paying the cost if they do? LPs. Again, every depositer of liquidity in their single-sided system is actually paired against BNT. Your profit as an LP *is* the ETH left behind by fees. If 1 bnETH has claim power on 2 ETH then you've profited. When BNT is sold to the pool is extracts ETH from the pool and your claim power is reduced. Last year, in their brilliance, the DAO decided liquidity mining was the future and they could mint and give away BNT to incentivize deposits. This year, a bunch of that BNT was collected and sold (a lot by 3AC). That wiped out the gains of the LPs entirely and then kept going. Now your 1 bnETH can claim like .6 ETH. Recap over, welcome to modern day. This is actually the source of their problem. They minted more BNT than their ecosystem profit by a large margin and then it got market dumped and wrecked LPs. This is ultimately the DAOs own fault for mismanaging BNT issuance. They serve as the lender of last resort, they mismanaged the system, and they wrecked themselves. I don't feel bad for BNT holders, I feel really bad for bnETH holders.\n\nSince we're strictly talking about the Dex at this point, what can be done to improve the situation on the Dex side?\n\n1) The easiest way to mitigate IL is to not incur it in the first place. Curve v2 pools and Kyber's DMM both dynamically adjust the depth chart of their AMM in response to volatility. Bancor can and should do something similar. I know this will be a surprise to some of you 'buy high sell low' guys but the time to sell an asset is not when it's violently ripping and the time to be buy an asset is not when it's violently crashing. If you remove liquidity during times of volatility you simply incur less IL.\n\n2) Deploy idle liquidity productively. There's two ways to get capital efficiency on the Dex side. The first is what Uniswap has done with Uniswap v3. You compress the depth chart so more of the liquidity is active near the strike price. The second is to put the idle liquidity to use. Balancer already does this a bit and Bancor has plans to with their \"superfluid\" liquidity. I believe it's on Tokemak's roadmap too. It's a fairly obvious idea really. If the price is only going to move +-50% in a day and you have a x*y=k bonding curve then half the assets aren't needed in the Dex on any given day. Put them in Compound or something and get some yield on them. Technically there's nothing stopping you from combining these options.\n\n3) Make the system more straightforward and configurable. Rather than giving 50% of the pool profit to the BNT holder who just happens to be the exchange, create an explicit and configurable exchange fee per pool.\n\n4) This one is going to be more contentious and radical. If 2 is possible then we can actually revisit the initial assumption of the Dex design. BNT was only needed because otherwise the capital would sit idle. If there's a way of productively employing liquidity that would otherwise be idle then you can just pair everything against ETH like Uniswap v2, rip BNT entirely out of the Dex and use it as a fee capture and governance token like Sushiswap. If you want to address the asset imbalance issue create a market solution where a higher percent of the trading fees go to the lower supply asset. This will restore trust now that people have been burned by BNT.\n\nOnto the topic of IL insurance. I talked about this like last August [here](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/protecting-against-impermanent-loss/). Maximizing IL efficiency is always going to require active liquidity management of some form. This was a core idea to Kyber's original whitepaper actually. You'd give your liquidity to some active manager and they would collect a share of the revenue for minimizing IL for you. This is the basic idea of more recent approaches like Impermax too where you provide liquidity as a 'lender' and a borrower serves as the liquidity manager and maximizes the fees and minimizes the IL. I call these approaches indirect LP. The task of active liquidity management to minimize IL is separable from the task of how the exchange works. Tokemak is a good example of someone *just* solving the active liquidity management role and delegating the exchange work to an exchange. If IL insurance is a product whomever can minimize IL and maximize fees is going to have a competitive edge as a product. If Bancor would like to continue offering an IL insurance product here are the changes I'd suggest.\n\n1) Add a parameter for the reflexivity of liquidity depth to volatility in addition to what Kyber and Curve do. Set it too high and you miss out on too few fees. Set it too low and you incur too much IL. Somewhere in between is the goldilocks zone the DAO can find on a per pool basis.\n\n2) It's a simple fact that different assets are going to experience different amounts of IL. An intelligent IL insurance product should account for that fact by having an adjustable IL insurance fee per asset.\n\n3) Build an IL insurance reserve like Maker's surplus buffer. Make the dashboards clear and create a plan as a DAO for how that should scale with TVL.\n\n4) They can issue a separate bond token like GRAIN as a backstop for insurance. I wrote about insurance as bonds backed by future revenue [here](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/when-things-go-wrong).\n\n5) Potentially you can mutate the IL insurance product to be exchange agnostic like Tokemak. All you're configuring here is your depth chart. It's better if it's done without a keeper but maybe the ecosystem would be better off if Bancor was just an IL insurance product running on top of Uniswap for less liquidity fragmentation.\n\nThere's a lot more to write on BNT tokenomics but that's a separate post.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Due to it imploding while we were at Hodlercon, one topic that came up was Bancor.

Make the dashboards clear and create a plan as a DAO for how that should scale with TVL.</p>\n\n<p>4) They can issue a separate bond token like GRAIN as a backstop for insurance. I wrote about insurance as bonds backed by future revenue <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/when-things-go-wrong\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>5) Potentially you can mutate the IL insurance product to be exchange agnostic like Tokemak. All you&#39;re configuring here is your depth chart. It&#39;s better if it&#39;s done without a keeper but maybe the ecosystem would be better off if Bancor was just an IL insurance product running on top of Uniswap for less liquidity fragmentation.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a lot more to write on BNT tokenomics but that&#39;s a separate post.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-06 10:37:34","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-07-06 10:43:45","id":"if3mfh8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vshw3m","parent_id":"t3_vshw3m","score":39,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/shitcoinking","body":"Your TLDR needs a TLDR","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Your TLDR needs a TLDR</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-06 10:42:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"if3n3kr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vshw3m","parent_id":"t1_if3mfh8","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Fledglingbanana","body":"Shitpost tl;dr you deposit token X, you get token bnX instead that\u2019s just partially backed by X, the rest is BNT (\u201cIL protection\u201d \ud83e\udd21\ud83d\ude02), BNT is a shitcoin that gets printed and dumped by farmers, hence you lose money","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Shitpost tl;dr you deposit token X, you get token bnX instead that\u2019s just partially backed by X, the rest is BNT (\u201cIL protection\u201d \ud83e\udd21\ud83d\ude02), BNT is a shitcoin that gets printed and dumped by farmers, hence you lose money</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-06 11:03:15","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-07-06 11:08:09","id":"if3q9z5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vshw3m","parent_id":"t1_if3n3kr","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/theethmeister","body":"Saving for later so I can read sober.

Couldn't sleep last night so I decided to spend the time doing server optimizations. This is by no means \"optimized\" to its fullest extent, but it's a start and has shown some nice improvements in performance and load times without having to add more resources to the VPS. \n\n[Apache](https://apache.org) is like the standard for web servers but it's just so slow in comparison to newer stuff like [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Litespeed](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-server). Alas, everything is built for compatibility with Apache. Oh no! What do we do if we want compatibility *and* speed!? Mmhmm.. How'd you know? That's right! NGINX Proxy + Apache. Now I know what you're thinking ... WTF does any of that mean. Well you see, Apache is great at serving up dynamic content, like PHP pages that need the server to \"render\" them before serving them.\n\nIt sucks at serving static resources like CSS, Images, JS, etc.. basically text files that the users browser \"render.\" So we're going to have our cake and eat it too! Now, in Reverse Proxy setup with Apache, NGINX intercepts webserver requests, if its a static file, it serves it. If its a dynamic file, it hands it off to apache to compile, then serves the \"rendered\" static file to the user. While it sounds more complicated, it actually improved initial page loading times by about 40%! There are still some MySQL server tweaks I can do as well.\n\nLast, all CSS, HTML, and JS have been minified and combined where possible. Still work to do there, but it's much better now. I started stripping and compressing all the images on site as well. Because I love a good quality image, I opted for \"lossless\" compression at the cost of some disk space savings. I mean, if artists are going to share images on site, it has to be lossless, not lossy. Exif data is stripped from all media uploads now too. Images are automatically optimized when you upload them, so you may notice a slight delay between 100% uploaded and when it displays. I'll work to minimize that delay going forward.\n\nToday, I'm writing a blog post on *The Hottest Quantum Resistant Cryptography Schemes of 2021* and trying to finish up a \"how to\" for setting up metamask and logging into Caches for total web3 noobs.
