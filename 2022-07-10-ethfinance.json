On the 4H grandpa notched one candle above $21.9k but that was it.\n\nI said we would likely retest $20.8k. *gestures at the current chart (exactly $20.8k for latecomers to this post).* It's holding but isn't anything I'd yet call a \"bounce\" off.\n\nNow, the weekend low volume caveat goes both directions. Up action on weekend volume is easily invalidated. Same goes for down action. Overall, this is all to plan. Near-term bullish.\n\nACTUALLY -- quick tangent -- a favorite analyst of mine I realize uses the word \"constructive\" when you get near-term bullish movement in a bear context, so I'm gonna use that from now.\n\nOverall, as planned and constructive in this near-term.\n\nHowever, I'd be remiss if we didn't call out that daily chart for it is, volume be damned. That can be a double-top in the making. It also matches the pattern we saw end of May into June, which preceded the next leg down. We'd all love for the Donut indicator to be a real thing, but let's be clear -- I invented it just two months ago and I'm no mathemalologist. It can absolutely be wrong and we need to prepare for downside targets if this evening star / double top plays out.
