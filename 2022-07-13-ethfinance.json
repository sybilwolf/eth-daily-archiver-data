The research that I try to follow most outside of Ethereum is different \"web3\" technologies. Messari does a pretty good job at that and recently they released another installment of their (paywalled) [web3 revenue report](https://messari.io/article/web3-infrastructure-q2-22-revenue-report). Here are a couple of takeaways.\n\nThe research covers a fairly wide breadth of projects by type:\n\n* Arweave  - permanent storage\n* Livepeer - video processing\n* The Graph - indexing of onchain data\n* Storj - storage obviously\n* Helium - network of wireless LoRa nodes, about to extend into 5G supposedly\n* Sia - storage\n* Akash - cloud computation\n* Filecoin - storage\n\nAside: After smart contract platforms in this domain imho lies some of the interesting future development and thus investment opportunity. Actually when people say \"web3\" I think of the above projects more than smart contract platforms even.\n\nFirst thing - revenue. Here is the graph of [revenues](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/6f7a319decdd4651ad5ce127831481d118ad2287-1000x563.jpg?w=900&fit=max&auto=format&dpr=3) over the past few quarters for the above. Two things might be obvious when you look at it - revenues are pretty much minuscule and have declined. Even Helium, with it's super impressive coverage of LoRa nodes, is barely making any money for it's node operators in terms of fees. The other takeaway is that Filecoin is not on the graph because it is earning 50x the fees for its nodes than the second largest earner - Arweave, although the revenue structure for FC is complex and not easy to sum up.\n\nNot all revenues declined and not all declined due to lack of usage though. The Graph is seeing a lot of people moving onto their new decentralized infrastructure and their revenue went up 1000% in the last quarter. Filecoin's active deals have doubled and their decrease in revenue is because they introduced SNARK optimizations to their network which made it 10-20x more efficient and cheaper to use. Filecoin's storage now costs less than 1% of what AWS charges.\n\nAside: I've been reading a whole lot about Filecoin. Protocol Labs et al. are massive juggernaut of development (especially in ZK domain, maybe even more than EF funded projects combined). Their introduction of FVM, a VM built into the network, is adding ability to infinitely customize storage and payment schemes without changes to the network. It also adds the ability to run L2 for off-chain computation on data with commitment. Let the implication of that sink in. I recommend you watch the [FVM intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw9syGiG31c).\n\nTakeaways - based on revenue model shit is really overvalued. Yes Helium is supposed to be introducing 5G and Filecoin is doing lots of development, but revenue is just not there yet. The projects' usage has held up through the downturn though and the sharp drop in market value made the prices more reasonable.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>With the downturn it became actually interesting to read  up on projects, cause I feel like I have an actual chance to invest.

Person A sees 1000 tokens at 1$ and puts a buy order.  Bot B see this and places an order for 1000 tokens at 1$ with higher priority fee.  Now person A buys her 1000 tokens at 1.01-1.05; she pays ~25$ more than expected.  Bot B sells his 1000 tokens at 1.05-1.01, making 25$-5$ gas.  But it\u2019s not just Bot B participating. Bot C finds a lower gas method and offers 10$ bribe so that he can steal that 25$ instead instead.  Then bot D offers more and has a lower gas cost.  she pays 20$ fee and 3$ gas, pocketing about 2$ in the process.  The proposer pockets 20$.  Rinse and repeat for every block.
