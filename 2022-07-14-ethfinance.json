Thanks so much for the words of comfort. As a first time international traveler I guess I had this way more serious perception of customs vs normal airport travel. I&#39;ve traveled with edibles like within the US but I figured it would just be suicide to try it thru customs but you&#39;ve made me feel pretty good about bringing some vitamin gummies from home. My naive hope was a form of edible that would pass undetected even upon a &quot;random&quot; inspection of my bag contents so I could bring all I need from home</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-14 16:47:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ig743q3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vynm1b","parent_id":"t1_ig5np74","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/T0Bii","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-14 08:32:19","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-08-15 11:22:12","id":"ig50ncg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vynm1b","parent_id":"t1_ig4a79j","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SwagtimusPrime","body":"Even in Bavaria those cases are regularly dropped but you're right that they do pursue them more often compared to other states.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Even in Bavaria those cases are regularly dropped but you&#39;re right that they do pursue them more often compared to other states.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-14 09:09:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ig56kp0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vynm1b","parent_id":"t1_ig50ncg","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/barthib","body":"???","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>???</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-14 08:44:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ig52mjl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vynm1b","parent_id":"t3_vynm1b","score":-4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/SnakePersons","body":"when will ether reach 2000-3000 $ usd?? not just asking for nothing only asking be cause i need it help pay my debt. i have debt from buying cards on credit cards and minimal repay payment is large. i borrowed from parents to cover 4 month of minimal repay but thats all i have. not just asking to gamble on price going up i promise i won't buy moreether knowing it could go up but i just want to have no debts","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>when will ether reach 2000-3000 $ usd?? not just asking for nothing only asking be cause i need it help pay my debt. i have debt from buying cards on credit cards and minimal repay payment is large. i borrowed from parents to cover 4 month of minimal repay but thats all i have. not just asking to gamble on price going up i promise i won&#39;t buy moreether knowing it could go up but i just want to have no debts</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-14 06:06:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ig4flr8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vynm1b","parent_id":"t3_vynm1b","score":-14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/MerkleChainsaw","body":"If this is real you already know the right answer, which is paying off your credit card and family debts, selling crypto and your graphic cards if necessary.
