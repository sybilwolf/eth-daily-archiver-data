But you have to view it from the perspective of investors who only know bitcoin. </p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin is the one asset everyone knows. ETH is Bitcoin Partner coin. Now the one coin everyone told you is the (THE!) new asset. The one thing that goes parabolic. The number one to rule them all. Your one bet to make it is flipped. And during a bear market where everyone is fearful anyways the holy grail in crypto is dethroned. What will these investors do? Sell their BTC cause it\u2019s all going to 0 of the safest asset isn\u2019t safe and not number 1 anymore. </p>\n\n<p>Hence: ETH going to 1 might cause a crypto selling cause BTC crashes and we know what that usually means. </p>\n\n<p>Can it be different? Of course! But would I prefer (if someone asked me) to flip BTC during a bear or a bull I will always go for the bull. People pay attention, memes/ narrative could prepare them. Now no one is paying attention and then the thing that isn\u2019t supposed to happen happens\u2026</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-17 05:25:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"igie1s1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w0zfzy","parent_id":"t1_igi5n1i","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"it would imply bitcoin is going bye bye, and when that happens people are going to be pikachu surprised and do stupid things, like sell ETH","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>it would imply bitcoin is going bye bye, and when that happens people are going to be pikachu surprised and do stupid things, like sell ETH</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-17 04:00:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"igi6vd0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w0zfzy","parent_id":"t1_igi5n1i","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheHighFlyer","body":"This would only be temporary just like the sell-off we had due to risk off and liqs and miner capitulation","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This would only be temporary just like the sell-off we had due to risk off and liqs and miner capitulation</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-17 04:04:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"igi7757","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w0zfzy","parent_id":"t1_igi6vd0","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"oh yes, that's why it would be stupid for them to sell.
