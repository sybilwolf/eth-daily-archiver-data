Its all vague mush about how you feel or what happened in 2018. I'm open to convincing, walk me through your thought process. I'll ask a few questions to help you get started.\n\n1. You talk constantly about \"the macro\". What do you see happening? Be specific. 2008 style housing collapse? Deep, prolonged recession? If you see those things happening, how do you think the Fed responds and do you think that mitigates the damage somewhat? What happens if those things don't happen and its more of a short, shallow recession?\n2. You've said multiple times that BTC is king and it seems your worldview is based on the assumption that we're just going to follow the same 4 year halving cycles we always have. I assume if you're here and not in r/buttcoin you're operating under the assumption that ETH will flip BTC someday, its just a matter of when. With the Merge upon us, do you completely discount the possibility that this is the beginning of the decoupling and that ETH could show strength vs BTC even if BTC struggles?\n3. You've mentioned multiple times you think ETH will break below its recent low. Who exactly do you think the sellers are down there? We just had a 7 month slow bleed with TWO forced selling/capitulation events. So you've had millions of ETH move from weak to strong hands at prices as much as 80% lower than ATH. Who exactly is selling below $880 who didnt sell the first time? I mean I guess if your answer to question 1 is Armageddon, that would force some selling. But what are the odds of that?\n4. You (and many others to be fair) have used the completely inappropriate \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" analogy to what you think will happen after the Merge. Do you seriously, after all this time, not understand what the Merge is and what it does? This isnt \"oh, i hear Apple may be doing a major iPhone upgrade let me buy now and sell when they announce it because it will be a year before we know if ts accretive to earnings\". Its not information asymmetry. It's math. Its a structural shift in flows. 95% reduction in issuance and 6 month minimum on staking rewards restrictions. With the flip of a switch (metaphorically) you go from x has to be bought every day to keep the price from going down to x has to be sold every day to keep the price from going up. With that likely happening within 2 months, you think we're going to goblintown, even in a bad macro environment?\n\nAny other bearish folks, feel free to jump in here as well.

Its all vague mush about how you feel or what happened in 2018. I&#39;m open to convincing, walk me through your thought process. I&#39;ll ask a few questions to help you get started.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You talk constantly about &quot;the macro&quot;. What do you see happening? Be specific. 2008 style housing collapse? Deep, prolonged recession? If you see those things happening, how do you think the Fed responds and do you think that mitigates the damage somewhat? What happens if those things don&#39;t happen and its more of a short, shallow recession?</li>\n<li>You&#39;ve said multiple times that BTC is king and it seems your worldview is based on the assumption that we&#39;re just going to follow the same 4 year halving cycles we always have. I assume if you&#39;re here and not in <a href=\"/r/buttcoin\">r/buttcoin</a> you&#39;re operating under the assumption that ETH will flip BTC someday, its just a matter of when. With the Merge upon us, do you completely discount the possibility that this is the beginning of the decoupling and that ETH could show strength vs BTC even if BTC struggles?</li>\n<li>You&#39;ve mentioned multiple times you think ETH will break below its recent low. Who exactly do you think the sellers are down there? We just had a 7 month slow bleed with TWO forced selling/capitulation events. So you&#39;ve had millions of ETH move from weak to strong hands at prices as much as 80% lower than ATH. Who exactly is selling below $880 who didnt sell the first time? I mean I guess if your answer to question 1 is Armageddon, that would force some selling. But what are the odds of that?</li>\n<li>You (and many others to be fair) have used the completely inappropriate &quot;buy the rumor, sell the news&quot; analogy to what you think will happen after the Merge. Do you seriously, after all this time, not understand what the Merge is and what it does? This isnt &quot;oh, i hear Apple may be doing a major iPhone upgrade let me buy now and sell when they announce it because it will be a year before we know if ts accretive to earnings&quot;. Its not information asymmetry. It&#39;s math. Its a structural shift in flows. 95% reduction in issuance and 6 month minimum on staking rewards restrictions.

Price feed works with chainlinks oracle. They have some interesting mechanism how idle pool get additional yields. In the current pool you deposit curve&#39;s tricrypto and&#39;ll get 80% curves rewards and only 20% is put into the trading platform earning trading fees. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s very fresh protocol, so I don&#39;t recommend to put too much of your stack into it (stay safe!). They just launched, and they limited the pool to 250k deposit max (150k left) and trading has just started today. So you&#39;re kind of early... </p>\n\n<p>docs: <a href=\"https://docs.rage.trade/\">https://docs.rage.trade/</a></p>\n\n<p>github: <a href=\"https://github.com/RageTrade\">https://github.com/RageTrade</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-18 08:48:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ignlk5k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w1qwv5","parent_id":"t3_w1qwv5","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-18 16:38:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"igpjo32","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w1qwv5","parent_id":"t3_w1qwv5","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TAKgod123","body":"850 didn't hit but 900 did I'll take it","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>850 didn&#39;t hit but 900 did I&#39;ll take it</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-18 17:36:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"igprdmn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w1qwv5","parent_id":"t1_igpjo32","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/gooner712004","body":"I had $850, I was $40 off ffs","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I had $850, I was $40 off ffs</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-18 17:08:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"igpnn14","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w1qwv5","parent_id":"t1_igpjo32","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/ab111292","body":"keep it open","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>keep it open</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-18 16:50:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"igpl62d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w1qwv5","parent_id":"t1_igpjo32","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I bet it hits later this year.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I bet it hits later this year.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-18 18:25:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"igpxxbg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w1qwv5","parent_id":"t1_igpjo32","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/REALJohnBMacLemore","body":"God damn it's f'ing hot out there!

A couple of things though ... any users that signed up prior to this update will still have their wallet address as a username. I am trying to decide if I should just delete every user and hope everyone signs up again, or take it on a case by case basis.
