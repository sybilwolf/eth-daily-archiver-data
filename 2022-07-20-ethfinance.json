According to Charles, part of the reason they designed Hydra as a state channel system was that they believed they could get it to market faster. Hoskinson and his researchers are no strangers to the inner workings of zk math, so his prediction is baffling.\n\nIn summary, what has Ethereum accomplished since that video in 2020?\n\n* Successfully launched the PoS beacon chain\n\n* Launched the merge on several final testnets\n\n* Increased its TVL by *over two orders of magnitude*\n\n* Became the premiere platform for trading monkey pictures\n\n* Released stable rock-solid application-specific zero knowledge rollups, widely-adopted beta-version general purpose optimistic rollups, and alpha-version general purpose zero knowledge rollups\n\nWhat has Cardano accomplished?\n\n* Launched smart contracts, finally, but nobody is really using them yet\n\n* Launched an alpha version of an EVM side chain, to try to make Cardano more compatible with all the Ethereum code that people have been writing in the mean time. IMO, this undermines their full commitment to functional programming.\n\n* Opened up a complex and uncharted new research space (scalable utxo contract systems with shared state), the fruits of which are necessary for basic Cardano smart contract system functionality\n\n* Added \"native\" token support, which is so much better than contract-based token support because...? Remind me why again? Championing the superiority of native tokens is basically telling a lie IMO. Stuff like this has the real potential to hurt investors if they don't have the sophistication to fully understand how limited its benefits are.\n\n* Charles has finally released some pre-alpha proof-of-concept Hydra code. But we both know what's been going on - the Hydra github repo's main functionality is to be something tangible he can point to when people accuse Hydra of being vaporware\n\n* Finally launched their own Layer 2 initiative, which honestly feels like they're running around between techs to see what sticks, while panicking and deserting their state-channel roadmap\n\n* Launched their first dex, but it relies on matchmaking bots and it's not composable with other contracts. Why would you be okay with giving up composability? That just lets down other contract developers who might want to integrate with the dex. I feel like Vitalik could really set the record straight, that current utxo system designs struggle with composability. It's honestly a shame that Vitalik seems too shy to say it on twitter.\n\nBasically, I find it a travesty that Charles can keep getting away with disguising inferior tech as \"backed by research\". I swear, his \"surprise AMAs\" make me want to cry sometimes. It's days like this I'm so glad I said goodbye to Charles and Cardano.\n\nWhat's crazy is that I feel like Hoskinson is the only person with the guts and charisma to pull this off. I guess you gotta give him props on some level - he knows the game of luring in low-information blockchain investors with technobabble, and he's gonna play it. This kind of behavior is uniquely Hoskinson's brand, I really think you wouldn't get this from any other guy.\n\nAlas, there's really only one thing that can save Cardano at this point. If you haven't caught on by now, watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), and with it fresh in your mind read my whole comment again very carefully.

And I believe, ultimately, over an arc of time, 5-10 years, they&#39;ll probably get there.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/E0EtPbBoXDQ?t=34\">https://youtu.be/E0EtPbBoXDQ?t=34</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That prediction was in 2020, which means Charles believed that zk rollups would be ready between 2025 and 2030. According to Charles, part of the reason they designed Hydra as a state channel system was that they believed they could get it to market faster. Hoskinson and his researchers are no strangers to the inner workings of zk math, so his prediction is baffling.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, what has Ethereum accomplished since that video in 2020?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Successfully launched the PoS beacon chain</p></li>\n<li><p>Launched the merge on several final testnets</p></li>\n<li><p>Increased its TVL by <em>over two orders of magnitude</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Became the premiere platform for trading monkey pictures</p></li>\n<li><p>Released stable rock-solid application-specific zero knowledge rollups, widely-adopted beta-version general purpose optimistic rollups, and alpha-version general purpose zero knowledge rollups</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What has Cardano accomplished?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Launched smart contracts, finally, but nobody is really using them yet</p></li>\n<li><p>Launched an alpha version of an EVM side chain, to try to make Cardano more compatible with all the Ethereum code that people have been writing in the mean time. IMO, this undermines their full commitment to functional programming.</p></li>\n<li><p>Opened up a complex and uncharted new research space (scalable utxo contract systems with shared state), the fruits of which are necessary for basic Cardano smart contract system functionality</p></li>\n<li><p>Added &quot;native&quot; token support, which is so much better than contract-based token support because...? Remind me why again? Championing the superiority of native tokens is basically telling a lie IMO. Stuff like this has the real potential to hurt investors if they don&#39;t have the sophistication to fully understand how limited its benefits are.</p></li>\n<li><p>Charles has finally released some pre-alpha proof-of-concept Hydra code. But we both know what&#39;s been going on - the Hydra github repo&#39;s main functionality is to be something tangible he can point to when people accuse Hydra of being vaporware</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally launched their own Layer 2 initiative, which honestly feels like they&#39;re running around between techs to see what sticks, while panicking and deserting their state-channel roadmap</p></li>\n<li><p>Launched their first dex, but it relies on matchmaking bots and it&#39;s not composable with other contracts. Why would you be okay with giving up composability? That just lets down other contract developers who might want to integrate with the dex. I feel like Vitalik could really set the record straight, that current utxo system designs struggle with composability. It&#39;s honestly a shame that Vitalik seems too shy to say it on twitter.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Basically, I find it a travesty that Charles can keep getting away with disguising inferior tech as &quot;backed by research&quot;. I swear, his &quot;surprise AMAs&quot; make me want to cry sometimes. It&#39;s days like this I&#39;m so glad I said goodbye to Charles and Cardano.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s crazy is that I feel like Hoskinson is the only person with the guts and charisma to pull this off. I guess you gotta give him props on some level - he knows the game of luring in low-information blockchain investors with technobabble, and he&#39;s gonna play it. This kind of behavior is uniquely Hoskinson&#39;s brand, I really think you wouldn&#39;t get this from any other guy.</p>\n\n<p>Alas, there&#39;s really only one thing that can save Cardano at this point. If you haven&#39;t caught on by now, watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">this short video</a>, and with it fresh in your mind read my whole comment again very carefully.
