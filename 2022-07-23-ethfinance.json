With PoW, BTC (and currently ETH) are like stored energy. The dollar has it's value because of oil and gold has it's value because of the effort of mining, so BTC has it's value because of the electricity consumed. When ETH goes PoS, it will be more like current fiat currencies than a store of effort. And fiat currencies aren't too attractive right now. (I personally think PoS ETH is amazing, but I'm trying to answer the other side.)\n\nOn #4, ossification: The goal of BTC was to replace money, not to become a massive worldwide computer. They created the basic functions of money and then stopped and became reliable. ETH keeps changing and keeps risking making a mistake. BTC doesn't change much at all and has very little chance of introducing a new systemic risk.

With PoW, BTC (and currently ETH) are like stored energy. The dollar has it&#39;s value because of oil and gold has it&#39;s value because of the effort of mining, so BTC has it&#39;s value because of the electricity consumed. When ETH goes PoS, it will be more like current fiat currencies than a store of effort. And fiat currencies aren&#39;t too attractive right now.

Clearly that's wrong, in actuality the network is more secure than ever according to all measurable stats.\n2. I don't know. Both coins are pretty decentralized, not too worried about it.\n3. No one is saying PoW is better. It's just different. They might argue it's better because it *works,* right now. \"But what about the climate and environment!\" is a ridiculous argument because a) BTC mining drives rational actors to the cheapest, most affordable energy (which is renewable) and b) do people go around not using their phones, computers, air con, cars because \"climate and the environment\"?? Of course not.\n4. Many would argue the ossification is a good thing. BTC is hard to change, which makes it more secure. Also keep in mind BTC is trying to do one thing and do that one thing very well- it doesn't need massive capabilities, world computer stuff like ETH. The base layer is OK to ossify as is.\n5. I haven't found this at all. Almost *everyone* I've met at events (who hold BTC) also hold ETH. All in different amounts. They're all kind and helpful. Every coin has it's toxic members, and if  you're going to places like Twitter or Reddit to interact with these people...then yea of course some people will come across as toxic- doesn't mean the whole community is that way.\n6. SoV & money= same thing. Can't have one without the other. Also I don't see how something like Lightning Network is centralized. There are tons of nodes in the network, and it is getting easier by the day to run a node or contribute to the decentralization. I've used it and it works fine. Definitely not \"grandma proof\" and still has a long way to go, though.

At the end of the day, though, trends are more powerful than any words or narrative. Look at BTC's on chain statistics and long term price stats. It's very clear that the network is growing, usage is going up, and there is long term price appreciation.\n\nDisclaimer: I hold both BTC and ETH.

Clearly that&#39;s wrong, in actuality the network is more secure than ever according to all measurable stats.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t know. Both coins are pretty decentralized, not too worried about it.</li>\n<li>No one is saying PoW is better. It&#39;s just different. They might argue it&#39;s better because it <em>works,</em> right now. &quot;But what about the climate and environment!&quot; is a ridiculous argument because a) BTC mining drives rational actors to the cheapest, most affordable energy (which is renewable) and b) do people go around not using their phones, computers, air con, cars because &quot;climate and the environment&quot;?? Of course not.</li>\n<li>Many would argue the ossification is a good thing. BTC is hard to change, which makes it more secure. Also keep in mind BTC is trying to do one thing and do that one thing very well- it doesn&#39;t need massive capabilities, world computer stuff like ETH. The base layer is OK to ossify as is.</li>\n<li>I haven&#39;t found this at all. Almost <em>everyone</em> I&#39;ve met at events (who hold BTC) also hold ETH. All in different amounts. They&#39;re all kind and helpful. Every coin has it&#39;s toxic members, and if  you&#39;re going to places like Twitter or Reddit to interact with these people...then yea of course some people will come across as toxic- doesn&#39;t mean the whole community is that way.</li>\n<li>SoV &amp; money= same thing. Can&#39;t have one without the other. Also I don&#39;t see how something like Lightning Network is centralized. There are tons of nodes in the network, and it is getting easier by the day to run a node or contribute to the decentralization. I&#39;ve used it and it works fine. Definitely not &quot;grandma proof&quot; and still has a long way to go, though. This was actually asked the other day in the LN sub: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/comments/uzivwq/how_is_the_lightning_network_centralized/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/comments/uzivwq/how_is_the_lightning_network_centralized/</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. At the end of the day, though, trends are more powerful than any words or narrative. Look at BTC&#39;s on chain statistics and long term price stats. It&#39;s very clear that the network is growing, usage is going up, and there is long term price appreciation.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I hold both BTC and ETH. Huge supporter of both coins and I strongly believe both will be worth far more in the future than today.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-23 05:44:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihbekm9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w5ve6t","parent_id":"t1_ihaimx6","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"There is nuance being missed in your response to 1.
