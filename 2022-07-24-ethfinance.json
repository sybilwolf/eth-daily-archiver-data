We're seeing a somewhat rare bit of counter-momentum today. On BTC's oscillators, bull control has crossed down and bears are wresting power. Meanwhile on ETH, bull averages have crossed back *up*.\n\nIn honor of that, some quick looks at the chart for ETH only. No grandpa for now.\n\n[Weekly](https://www.tradingview.com/x/fahtxkrd/), obviously short-term leaning bullish as oscillators emerge from extreme negativity. However, note the RSI at the bottom is about to hit a resistance area. Could be turbulence. Could be nothing. Maybe an area I won't be betting the family chain of hot dog stands on a long. We are still in a downtrend after all.\n\n[Daily](https://www.tradingview.com/x/g5xvzFXM/), a bit muddier and very near-term leaning bearish. We've got bear divs within bear divs; let's take em one at a time. First is the easiest, green arrow up is higher high price and red arrow down is lower high RSI. It's running out of steam in a bearish divergence. It's safe to close above that 1580 price if and only if RSI is also above 68.8 for the day. Second, the hidden bear div -- blue lines (best I can do to delineate). From the last time we at the 1900 area, we're looking at a lower high while RSI is at a higher high (and coming down from being nigh overbought). It's again bearish.\n\nBut we've got that thin sky blue line, bit of a channel potentially forming if we can get a nice, healthy retrace and retest of that 1350 region. That wouldn't be bad at all. We broke A LOT of structure on the way down and these bear divs are artifacts of said destruction. This is a fine way to form a bottom and come out of it slowly and healthily. That said, the very near-term does suggest a little downward action.\n\nIn the news, it is of course big time tech earnings week. MAMAA's coming for dinner and she wants the whole roast.\n\n***Tuesday 7/26 - Microsoft & Alphabet*** (the artist formerly known as Google)\n\n***Wednesday 7/27 - Meta*** (the artist formerly known as Facebook)\n\n***Thursday 7/28 - Apple & Amazon*** (the artists who have yet to suffer mid-career identity crises)\n\nThis is as big as it gets in news--\n\nOH MY GOD HERE COMES JPOW WITH THE TABLE. BAH GAWD THAT CHART HAD A FAMILY!\n\nYep. It's Fed week, too. Thought I'd forget?\n\nAlso on ***WEDNESDAY 7/27 @ 2PM NYC TIME -*** Papa Powell and the Feds perform the latest interest rate decision. 75bps is a clear winner with speculators with an 80% chance compared to only 20% that think a full 100bps is possible.\n\nPrepare the water-based lube because good or bad we're gonna need it for this week's action.\n\n\\*EXTRA\\*\n\nSome added thoughts... We saw something a little frightening this week in the sectors as the trading week came to an end.\n\nXLF financials, with their middling earnings and mixed beats and misses, closed up a whopping 9%.\n\nXLK tech, with the mostly banner week and shockingly positive earnings... tanked with some heavy hitters down nearly 10%.\n\nSure, there was Twitter's horrendous loss and miss. Yeah, there was Snap disappointing. But those are higher beta, sorta meme-y, kinda expected drops. I'm talking about scary shit like AT&T, falling 11.5% in two trading periods. Verizon dropping 12%. These aren't meme stocks. These are blue chips. They DO NOT move this way in a normal market. Be very, very careful. There is still something terribly, terribly wrong in this environment. And I know we'll love it if that \"wrongness\" sends ETH to a local moon. But if something breaks and hurts, we'll have seen some signs in this bizarre movement.

This is a fine way to form a bottom and come out of it slowly and healthily. That said, the very near-term does suggest a little downward action.</p>\n\n<p>In the news, it is of course big time tech earnings week. MAMAA&#39;s coming for dinner and she wants the whole roast.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Tuesday 7/26 - Microsoft &amp; Alphabet</em></strong> (the artist formerly known as Google)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Wednesday 7/27 - Meta</em></strong> (the artist formerly known as Facebook)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Thursday 7/28 - Apple &amp; Amazon</em></strong> (the artists who have yet to suffer mid-career identity crises)</p>\n\n<p>This is as big as it gets in news--</p>\n\n<p>OH MY GOD HERE COMES JPOW WITH THE TABLE. BAH GAWD THAT CHART HAD A FAMILY!</p>\n\n<p>Yep. It&#39;s Fed week, too. Thought I&#39;d forget?</p>\n\n<p>Also on <strong><em>WEDNESDAY 7/27 @ 2PM NYC TIME -</em></strong> Papa Powell and the Feds perform the latest interest rate decision. 75bps is a clear winner with speculators with an 80% chance compared to only 20% that think a full 100bps is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Prepare the water-based lube because good or bad we&#39;re gonna need it for this week&#39;s action.</p>\n\n<p>*EXTRA*</p>\n\n<p>Some added thoughts... We saw something a little frightening this week in the sectors as the trading week came to an end.</p>\n\n<p>XLF financials, with their middling earnings and mixed beats and misses, closed up a whopping 9%.</p>\n\n<p>XLK tech, with the mostly banner week and shockingly positive earnings... tanked with some heavy hitters down nearly 10%.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, there was Twitter&#39;s horrendous loss and miss. Yeah, there was Snap disappointing. But those are higher beta, sorta meme-y, kinda expected drops. I&#39;m talking about scary shit like AT&amp;T, falling 11.5% in two trading periods. Verizon dropping 12%. These aren&#39;t meme stocks. These are blue chips. They DO NOT move this way in a normal market. Be very, very careful. There is still something terribly, terribly wrong in this environment. And I know we&#39;ll love it if that &quot;wrongness&quot; sends ETH to a local moon. But if something breaks and hurts, we&#39;ll have seen some signs in this bizarre movement. Just... be careful, friends.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, cheers!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-24 01:25:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihfcl7e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w6nm34","parent_id":"t3_w6nm34","score":68,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Lastwordsbyslick","body":"This is great stuff.
