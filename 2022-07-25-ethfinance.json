This irks me for two reasons: firstly placing reliance on people losing their coins as a basis of monetary policy seems ridiculous, and secondly the majority of coins are already lost (isolated events that are not ongoing, with the definitions of deflation/inflation being \u2018sustained\u2019 movements over time).</p>\n\n<p>And then I read something like this: <a href=\"https://petertodd.org/2022/surprisingly-tail-emission-is-not-inflationary\">https://petertodd.org/2022/surprisingly-tail-emission-is-not-inflationary</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In fact, due to the inevitability of lost coins, a fixed reward converges to a stable monetary supply that is neither inflationary nor deflationary, with the total supply proportional to rate of tail emission and probability of coin loss.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whilst it could possibly be true, emissions could indeed be offset, how is this a sound argument that is anything but saving face? This could just as easily not happen, and this uncertainty is the opposite of \u2018stability\u2019. As Bitcoin advocates will be quick to point out, one of its \u2018strengths\u2019 is its predictable issuance policy.</p>\n\n<p>And don\u2019t get me wrong - tail emissions make sense, but I just don\u2019t see how you can state that they are not inflationary.</p>\n\n<p>Lost coins do not constitute deflation, or am I crazy?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-24 22:23:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihjjtxp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w7fx5q","parent_id":"t3_w7fx5q","score":40,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"They know that the 21 million limit doesn't work, and they also know they're left with a community which will die defending the limit.

I had a Mac in the 90\u2019s as a kid, and we had to go to a run down Apple store to get specific software and games we wanted. I just wanted to play Warcraft 2. Every other \u2018normal\u2019 store carried all Windows stuff and mocked Apple products relentlessly. The vast majority of 90\u2019s sentiment expected Apple was doomed to go out of business very soon.</p>\n\n<p>Then somehow, over the past couple decades - Apple became the hottest shit on the market. iThis, iThat, it exploded in popularity. So much so that you\u2019d get peer pressured into an iPhone if you didn\u2019t already have one.</p>\n\n<p>Now look at us. Nearly everyone has at least 1 apple product in their home.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-25 14:38:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihmt8z1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w7fx5q","parent_id":"t1_ihmr7lx","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-25 16:02:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihn5e7h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w7fx5q","parent_id":"t1_ihmt8z1","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Survivaleast","body":"Haha well, alrighty then - I stand corrected.\n\nI made the jump from Apple to Windows in terms of operating systems, but wound up with one of their phones.\n\nApple computers bring absolutely 0 value to me in terms of what I want with a pc or laptop, but I can\u2019t complain about having one of their phones.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Haha well, alrighty then - I stand corrected.</p>\n\n<p>I made the jump from Apple to Windows in terms of operating systems, but wound up with one of their phones.</p>\n\n<p>Apple computers bring absolutely 0 value to me in terms of what I want with a pc or laptop, but I can\u2019t complain about having one of their phones.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-25 16:16:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihn7b3j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w7fx5q","parent_id":"t1_ihn5e7h","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"This is *so* maddening that I now require beer.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is <em>so</em> maddening that I now require beer.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-25 14:17:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihmpy4i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w7fx5q","parent_id":"t1_ihmocjn","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Mhotdemnot","body":"Vitalik with some \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n\nhttps://nitter.net/VitalikButerin/status/1551603545752870912?t=Ki-lHwi3rCIKZeligKOGSw&s=19","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Vitalik with some \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.net/VitalikButerin/status/1551603545752870912?t=Ki-lHwi3rCIKZeligKOGSw&amp;s=19\">https://nitter.net/VitalikButerin/status/1551603545752870912?t=Ki-lHwi3rCIKZeligKOGSw&amp;s=19</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-25 10:05:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihlm6hc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w7fx5q","parent_id":"t3_w7fx5q","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BigglyBillBrasky","body":"This is awesome...
