For example I remember reading that Treasury borrowing (ie, Treasury bond issuance) has been down for a couple months now because they got a lot of money in capital gains tax receipts in April - but that is running out so they are expected to issue more bonds. </p>\n\n<p>Is the Treasury borrowing money to pay debt service &quot;real yield&quot;? Complicated, but probably yes, I guess - they are not literally printing the money to pay debt.  </p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that the Fed does not literally print money and give it to the Treasury - but they DO print money (when doing QE) and buy Treasuries and private sector bonds, which is basically the same thing isn&#39;t it, even if there&#39;s one more step in the middle somewhere? Even more so when you consider that it&#39;s the Treasury buying/QE that&#39;s helping to keep bond interest rates low enough for the Treasury to be able to afford the interest payments..</p>\n\n<p>Anyway it&#39;s an interesting intellectual exercise which is why I wrote all this, but for our purposes, I think probably enough to say that the Ethereum vs USD equivalent is not a perfect analogy but probably (in our opinion - clearly not in @gametheorizing&#39;s opinion) close enough to trigger similar effects in the ETH-USD pair, just as we&#39;re seeing on a much larger scale in the Yen-USD pair..</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-27 16:17:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihx4ace","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w95mn6","parent_id":"t1_ihx2ic0","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/interweaver","body":"Very interesting.

There are margin trading protocols like <a href=\"https://fulcrum.trade/trade\">Fulcrum</a>, <a href=\"https://marginswap.finance/\">Marginswap</a>, and <a href=\"https://app.sushi.com/bento/kashi/borrow\">Kashi</a>. There are perpetual swaps like <a href=\"https://perp.fi/\">perpetual</a> or <a href=\"https://leverj.io/\">leverj</a>. Lastly there are leverage tokens like <a href=\"https://medium.com/set-protocol/introducing-eth-btc-ratio-trading-on-tokensets-768dbb10a609\">Set</a> has or <a href=\"https://help.tokensets.com/en/articles/5049435-how-do-leverage-tokens-work\">Index Coop</a> has.</p>\n\n<p>Leverage trading is not for the uninitiated. Slow down and understand how it works before you take action on something more complicated than Aave. Also, this isn&#39;t particularly my area so some of these links may have the concept generally but not that specific pair.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-27 21:39:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ihy9ge6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_w95mn6","parent_id":"t1_ihy7e69","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sayno2mids","body":"Thanks for the info.
