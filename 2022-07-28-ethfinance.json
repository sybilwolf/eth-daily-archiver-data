This long awaited upgrade finally brings full scalability to Etereum, meaning that Etherem will have 10,000 TPS and transaction fees will be a fraction of a penny.

If you are a miner, you do not need to take any action on the day of the merge - there is no way for Vitalik to actually shut down the PoW, so your hardware will continue mining blocks and generating ETH until the difficulty bomb destroys your hardware.
