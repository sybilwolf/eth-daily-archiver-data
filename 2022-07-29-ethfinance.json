This isn't actually something unique to blockchain governance; it's generally also a problem with land-based delegate systems e.g. US Senate. If someone is an expert in something like road infrastructure they probably are not also an expert on medical technologies or constitutional law. Similarly, if someone in MakerDAO is an expert on risk management of various vaults there is little reason to expect they are also an expert on RWA or marketing and yet MKR is the only voting token for all. Our voting systems lack any granularity or even concept of your expertise when tallying votes. This bothers me and is just intuitively, *obviously* flawed in my view.\n\nBroadly speaking, governance systems want informed, rational people get together to make informed, rational decisions about the most important issues of the day. This principle is violated when you give everyone an equal vote, delegated or otherwise. I know this line of reasoning isn't democratic and I'm ok with that. To apply a Defi-native concept to governance, the blockchain systems we are building offer equal opportunity of access, not equal results. There is very little in this ecosystem that even implicitly is attempting to fight wealth inequality. Instead, Defi just promises that whatever financial tricks the whales are using to get richer are available to you in exactly the same way. *Permissionless* is only one facet of *fairness* but it's a big deal around here and an important improvement over Tradfi. Applying this to governance, everyone should be *able* to earn an equal vote but not everyone (or every dollar) should *have* an equal vote. This is especially true if that influence is being misused perpetually. Your vote on issues with measurable results should be weighted by your aptitude on the matter being voted on. For now, set aside the topic of how you prove who is rational and informed. Suffice to say technology has made certain solutions feasible in that regard that previously weren't and I'll write about that soon. The first claim I'd make to you is just that an optimal governance system is technocratic on decisions with measurable outcomes and where aptitude can be used to improve those outcomes.\n\nAbove these lower level decisions are other decisions about the values of the DAO which correspond to things like the relative levels of funding of different initiatives and teams in the DAO as well as defining optimization functions. I'd separate the types of issues being voted on according to [Hume's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem). Issues that define *ought* can be handled in a more democratic way so long as you solve for sybil-resistance somehow (we do that today with capital). Issues that define *is* should be handled by a more technocratic system where rational, informed voters have more influence on the outcome.\n\nPut into practice, this implies you want to modularize DAOs with units that have clear accountability to the value alignment votes of the system. These DAO modules should be organized in accordance with the tree of knowledge (broken down by aptitude at the required task). Within each module your voting influence is earned rather than granted. I still believe you need a conflict resolution system in these sub-modules (voting is still a fine mechanism) but capital is not the same as expertise and accordingly is a poor basis for allocation of influence. Therefore, within a module you want inalienable influence that earned according to proven expertise that should not require capital to bootstrap. Once the goals of the module have been set by value alignment votes you want influence at the lower levels to flow towards those most capable of furthering the established goals.\n\nA good example of this modular style design is [Rune's Endgame Plan](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-endgame-plan-parts-1-2/15456) for MakerDAO.

Other issues, should be. This posts provides a qualitative framework for what types of issues should be solved what way, applies that reasoning to DAOs we see today, and provides some guidance on how to evolve what we have today towards something better. That's already a meaty chunk for discussion without diving into the question of which set of people should define the values of a DAO, and how to identify the set of people who are informed and rational to make decisions on more quantifiable matters, and various forms of reduction functions to reduce a multi-dimensional space to a single value to be optimized.

How to define the ought shouldn&#39;t be handled technocratically. Other issues, should be. This posts provides a qualitative framework for what types of issues should be solved what way, applies that reasoning to DAOs we see today, and provides some guidance on how to evolve what we have today towards something better. That&#39;s already a meaty chunk for discussion without diving into the question of which set of people should define the values of a DAO, and how to identify the set of people who are informed and rational to make decisions on more quantifiable matters, and various forms of reduction functions to reduce a multi-dimensional space to a single value to be optimized.

In addition to the 4-Eth minipools we've been hearing about, they have some other major improvements in the works that could easily catapult them past Lido in terms of number of validators (which, because it's actually a fully decentralized protocol, would be a good thing, not a bad thing). One of the biggest things IMO is the ability for solo stakers to convert their validators seamlessly into Rocket Pool minipools (post-Capella), and presumably add 7x as many more minipools at the same time, given the lowered 4-Eth stake required.\n\nHuge fingers crossed this all can get implemented in time to make a difference.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The answer to our Lido concerns may be...
