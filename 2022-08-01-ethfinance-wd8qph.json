However, some miners might continue to mine on a vestigial PoW fork of Ethereum. Unless the miners are able to coordinate and create their own new PoW-only release of the Geth client, with a new chain ID, **before the Merge**, it will be possible to \"replay\" transactions made on one side of the fork, onto the other one. Anyone can do this, at zero cost to themselves. \n\nThis means if you try to sell your Eth or other assets on the PoW fork, *you might lose your real Eth or other assets too.*\n\n**How can I keep my real Eth 100% safe?**\n\nDon't touch the PoW fork. That's it, that's your only option.\n\n**Okay, but I want to anyway. How can I keep my real Eth 95% safe?**\n\nYou need to try and ensure that your transactions on the PoW fork cannot be replayed with your real assets on the PoS fork. To do this, you want to make it be the case that **any replayed transactions will fail for some reason.** Some possible approaches:\n\n1. **Make it fail because of invalid nonces.** \"Use up\" some nonces on the PoS fork, before submitting a PoW fork transaction. Do at least as many transactions on the real chain as you plan to do on the PoW fork, so that those nonces are no longer valid. The PoW transactions, once you make them, will use those same old nonces, and the transaction will fail if an attacker tries to replay it on PoS. *Make sure to do this AFTER the Merge, otherwise those nonces will be used up on PoW and PoS both, and this approach won't help.*\n2. **Make it fail because of invalid preconditions.** Move your Eth or other assets to a different wallet on the PoS fork. Then you can safely dump your PoW fork Eth or whatever. If that transaction is attempted to be replayed on the PoS fork, it will fail because the preconditions (i.e. your Eth is still there) will fail. Same as above - you have to do this *after* the Merge.\n3. **Make it fail because of too-low gas.** Send your transactions with a very low basefee on the PoW fork. Post-Merge, the basefee on the PoW fork is extremely likely to take a hard nosedive, likely to small fractions of a gwei (this happened on Polygon when they first implemented 1559). This is due to a lack of demand compared to the real Ethereum chain. It means you will be able to get transactions through on the PoW chain for insanely cheaply, and more importantly, that there's very little chance of those transactions getting replayed on the PoS fork. The attempted replay won't fail, but it will be stuck forever because it will never have enough gas to meet basefee on the real PoS fork.\n\n**So what about that 5%? What can go wrong?**\n\nImagine an attacker decides to replay all transactions that people are doing on the PoS fork, onto the PoW fork (this is the reverse of the replays I've been warning about above). So all your legitimate business conducted on the normal chain would be mirrored onto the PoW fork. This would only work for so long, because the state on the real fork will eventually diverge from that on the PoW fork, but it would definitely work for weeks or months post-Merge in most cases. Importantly, if someone does this, *it would defeat 1. and 2. above*. \n\nIf you attempted to up your nonces on PoS first, but the attacker just mirrored those transactions onto PoW, then when you went to submit your PoW transaction, the nonce would be fresh on both forks, and you'd be risking your real Eth. \n\nSimilarly, if you moved your assets before touching PoW, the attacker might've copied those moves first. In this case, you would just find your Eth already gone from the address you had been planning to dump it from. You might be tempted to dump it from the address it got moved to, but that's just back to the original risk.\n\nFor 3., the risk, of course, is gas actually getting that low on the real PoS fork for whatever reason. Unlikely, but not impossible.\n\n**Is all this trouble worth it for a few tens or hundreds of dollars worth of fake Eth?**\n\nNo.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Following the interest in my post about replay attacks yesterday, I thought I would give a more comprehensive overview of the situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What&#39;s the issue?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the Merge, Ethereum will be PoS.

And I have to build them in such a way that they do not fall apart two days later. Or at least that is what my editors hope. However, I will reveal a secret to you: I like to build universes which do fall apart. I like to see them come unglued, and I like to see how the characters in the novels cope with this problem. I have a secret love of chaos. There should be more of it. Do not believe \u2014 and I am dead serious when I say this \u2014 do not assume that order and stability are always good, in a society or in a universe.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The old, the ossified, must always give way to new life and the birth of new things. Before the new things can be born the old must perish. This is a dangerous realization, because it tells us that we must eventually part with much of what is familiar to us. And that hurts. But that is part of the script of life. Unless we can psychologically accommodate change, we ourselves begin to die, inwardly. What I am saying is that objects, customs, habits, and ways of life must perish so that the authentic human being can live. And it is the authentic human being who matters most, the viable, elastic organism which can bounce back, absorb, and deal with the new.\u201d</em> -Philip K.
