I call this the *Fork readiness checklist*:\n\n1. Geth fork to remove the merge code. Or at least clear instructions how to run an older version or manually disable the TTD. Later, there would also be the need to remove the difficulty bomb.\n2. RPC providers so people can use the fork without having to run a node.\n3. CEX support. People need to be able to buy/sell the forked ETH for fiat for it to have a valuation. Bridges to other chains would also work for this.\n4. In order to sustain the price, there need to be users who are willing to hold the new forked coins and buy more. Or new users buying more coins.\n5. Enough hashrate to secure the chain.\n\nAnd most of those are linked together. Miners need the coins to have value to make profits and also CEX to sell the coins.

Airdrops aren&#39;t better because the protocols still needs to raise for development, so it just becomes a VC only ICO preceding the airdrop, and token distribution gets severely misbalanced in that process. </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s never going to be a perfect distribution mechanism--and this isn&#39;t to say ICOs aren&#39;t flawed by any means--but there were at least a few ICOs that actually had pretty good gini coefficients compared to mining only. Anecdotally it seems like mining also has a bias for distribution to a more technically inclined and affluent network participants too. Eth&#39;s balance of ICO + years of mining and years of staking is a pretty hard to beat mix imo.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-02 10:32:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iio43bz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_we2rnd","parent_id":"t1_iio0ng3","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/TheHighFlyer","body":"Beware of the masternode","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Beware of the masternode</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-02 10:32:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iio45h9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_we2rnd","parent_id":"t1_iio0ng3","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/TheHighFlyer","body":"This is just the second layer, the core lies in the design of the blockchain itself.

Let's call them \"bridges\".\n\nReal, canonical bridges lock up your token on L1 Ethereum in the bridge contract, and mint a fake version of it on the L2 or alt-L1. Then when you want to withdraw back to L1 Ethereum, it burns the fake token and gives you back the original token on L1. This is why if a bridge contract gets hacked, all of the fake tokens are now valueless, because the real tokens backing them are gone.\n\nHop/Orbiter/etc. work differently. These \"bridge\" protocols have *liquidity* on both L1 Ethereum and the L2/alt L1. This liquidity consists of real tokens on L1, and fake tokens on the other chain *that have already been bridged via the official bridge at an earlier date*. This liquidity is owned by *other people*, often the operators of the \"bridge\". When you throw your L1 coin into this \"bridge\", they'll simply claim that coin for themselves, adding it to the L1 liquidity pool. They don't mint a new token on other chain corresponding to it, but rather, just hand you that chain's version of the token from their liquidity pool that's already present. When you \"bridge\" back, this process is reversed. The fake token is *not* burned on the other chain, it just goes back into their liquidity pool there.\n\nSo a few key distinguishing factors of these \"bridges\" versus real bridges:\n\n* They do not lock up and unlock, or mint and burn, tokens. Rather, they just accept and hand out liquidity.\n\n* They can work instantly, because the tokens already exist. No need to wait through lengthy challenge periods that official bridges on optimistic rollups often have.\n\n* The liquidity is not guaranteed to be present. Sometimes these \"bridges\" run out of liquidity because a lot of people moved in one direction or the other, and then they can't be used until the liquidity is replenished.\n\n* The liquidity is owned by others. If a \"bridge\" contract gets hacked, it's their liquidity providers who take the L. It has no impact on the value of the fake tokens on the L2/alt L1 - they still retain their 1:1 backing that was created by the canonical bridge contract.\n\n* These \"bridges\" often charge fees, because the liquidity providers on them ain't plopping down significant capital out of the goodness of their hearts.\n\nSo from your perspective as a user, it's actually a much worse disaster if a canonical bridge contract (like Nomad...) gets hacked, because that rugs the entire supply of the fake token on the other chain. A \"bridge\" getting hacked just means you can't use it anymore until they fix the bug and add more liquidity.\n\nOn the other hand, \"bridges\" tend to be more centralized. There's no guarantee they hand you back liquidity on the other side of the \"bridge\" - you have to trust them. Same deal with real bridges onto alt-L1s. Real bridges onto true L2s do not have the same centralization issues, and the only worries there are smart contract bugs.\n\nHope that helps!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To add onto the great answers below with my also limited understanding:</p>\n\n<p>There are bridges, and then there are things like Hop/Orbiter, which are not strictly bridges.
