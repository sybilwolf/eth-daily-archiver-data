Otherwise, someone could come along with a few hundred grand and 51% attack you for a day. Currently Bitcoin has this level of security. But \"mom and pop miners\" who presumably would be mining with 1/40th of the hashrate have zero capability to prevent a 51% attack by the other 39/40th of the hashrate that stopped mining, a large amount of which would presumably have ended up available for rent.

I think the tweet was by Cobie and basically he asked \"what is your most controversial belief\" and someone answered \"the stock market will not print a new ATH for the next decade\". I couldn't find the tweet, sorry. The reply felt so off, like how could someone just think that's a possibility? Later (and completely unrelated to that tweet) I saw a graphic about historical stock market data/ development, basically bear/ bull periods. u/kbrot was so nice to share [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YWCHgbBc/) with me. The 2000's basically were (I guess) the blueprint for the reply, since it took the S&P 13 years from the dotcom bubble and the crisis 2008/9 to recover and print new ATHs. Interestingly (because I am looking for real estate and was talking to some friends about the crazy real estate prices where I live) I found out that [real estate in Germany](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online?sequenz=tabelleErgebnis&selectionname=61262-0001#abreadcrumb) basically showed a similar behaviour. 2000-2010 is some minor ups and downs, but the real bull market starts in 2011/12 (the data is sadly until 2017 only, but since then its up only).\n\nI don't know about you, but recency bias apparently really is a thing and I was \"stuck\" with all the info I had of the last couple of years (of up only). Now back then I didn't really pay attention to real estate and not even stock markets. And of course this period is special because of the two crashes within a short period of time - but still, if you had asked me I probably would have answered that stocks is up only since 25 years and I think that's the general narrative (\"if you own stocks and dont touch them for 10+ years it's impossible to lose money\") and wouldn't have expected a 13 year period between old and new ATH (or: local high).\n\nNow do I think we will see no new ATH until 2030? I think (especially looking at the S&P graphic from kbrot) that the bear market we are witnessing right now is not comparable to the ones in 2000 and 2008 and we would need to crash way lower to even think about 8 years without new highs. That probably needs more than just a 2-quarter recession and IIRC kbrot even said that if something something this week then the macro bears are gone for now... At the same time there is already one war, the winter is still 4-6 months out and when Russia cuts gas etc. to hurt Europe things might change again, US and China aren't exactly friends these days and inflation isn't gone yet (at least in Europe, the markets seem to tell us a different story, but I am not convinced there's nothing more to come).\n\nSo why this post? I was very surprised about what I found out. I think the \"no new ATH for a decade\" reply isn't as controversial as it sounded when I heard it first. It's not likely, but we shouldn't discard it (again: mostly because of recency bias) and be open minded about different scenarios.

Shoutout my econ prof. NQ is up like 6% since last Thursday and crypto is basically flat. So for now, it seems the beta is less on the upside and almost 2x on the downside. Whats that tell you? In the world of risk assets, crypto is still perceived as the *riskiest* asset. Crypto moves will likely occur in a more downside \"velocity\" vs the upside because there just arent that many people who are in the crypto markets as compared to 2020-2021. There are no more handouts/retail checks/ppp loans/ fed injected liquidity. Crypto is the riskiest asset class and it needs liquidity *inflows* to keep prices flat (going back to original definition of liquidity above). And that is just not happening.\n\nWe had an insane bull run for 2 years. It is not coming back so easily. Look at any of the HTF charts. Similar to 2018 where we had huge BMRs that are also occurring now. But also like 2018 people didn't derisk, lost money, and over the 2-3 year bear period just dipped out. Right now, monthly users on exchanges isn't going up, volumes are going down, and money is being outflowed. The hodlers (money already in the ecosystem) does not equal new inflows. New money, new people, price goes up. Right now money and people are clearly leaving. This is also why I think its silly to call a bottom at this time. A true bottom is a range-bound environment with price chop for several months (check 2018 and 2019 BTC and ETH range bound charts).\n\nAs someone likely wiser than me once said \"if you fill a tub with water to the brim and then pull the plug, does the water disappear instantly or does it drain over time? Liquidity is slowly drained from the tub. Every once in a while people jump in and water rises temporarily (currently and march BMRs) but overtime, the water drains.\"\n\nAll signs point to liquidity.\n\nJust want to provide my opinion and at least force people to look at things differently and challenge their views in here.\n\nAB - Still short term bullish and macro bear that is hype AF for the merge because I am an ETH maxi at the end of the day.

But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.\u00a0\n\nSo the wolf knocked on the door and said:\u00a0Little pigs! Little pigs! \u00a0\u00a0Let me in!\n\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:\u00a0No! No! No! \u00a0Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\n\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\u00a0Then I'll huff, \u00a0and I'll puff,\u00a0and I'll blow your house down.Well! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. \n\nSo he stopped to rest and thought a bit.But this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil.

But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn&#39;t eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So the wolf knocked on the door and said:\u00a0Little pigs! Little pigs! \u00a0\u00a0Let me in!</p>\n\n<p>But the little pigs saw the wolf&#39;s narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:\u00a0No! No! No! \u00a0Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!</p>\n\n<p>So the wolf showed his teeth and said:\u00a0Then I&#39;ll huff, \u00a0and I&#39;ll puff,\u00a0and I&#39;ll blow your house down.Well! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn&#39;t huff and he couldn&#39;t puff anymore. </p>\n\n<p>So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.But this was too much.
