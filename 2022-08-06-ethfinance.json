The first topic is a forecast for the world and the resources each of us will have access to. Just going by the data I see the outlook there is pessimistic. Even if all we do is project [the trends we have seen](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) in the past several decades forward the data indicates that the US is in decline and the lives of its citizens in 30 years will be worse off than today.\n\nThe second topic is blockchain technology and its potential impact. My writing on this topic is far more positive. Even if everything I wrote yesterday comes true and the overall future state of world is bleak there will still be sources of hope and light within it. When looking at the sky we focus on the stars not the overwhelming darkness between them. This is how we stay sane, even if it is a coping mechanism. To me, this ecosystem is one of those points of light. The [human coordination](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/human-coordination) post I linked in that post yesterday ends on a relatively optimistic tone despite using problems like global warming as a backdrop to highlight the significance of this technology.\n\n>That brings me back to my main point. This industry is the single most important thing any of us can be involved in. Your involvement, no matter how trivial, is contributing to one of the brightest and most significant technology trends in human history. If nothing else, your mere presence here makes you a data point. You can\u2019t walk this path and not leave footprints that help to guide others. Every step we take as an industry is charting territory. If you have received an airdrop, you are helping experiment with bootstrapping mechanisms. If you\u2019ve voted in a snapshot poll you\u2019ve helped improve the UX of governance solutions. If you lent or borrowed funds you\u2019ve indirectly funded a decentralized oracle. If you posted on Reddit or Twitter, you\u2019ve helped shape Layer 0. If you are here in this Rabbit Hole with me, you are invariably contributing to something significant.\n\n> We are working to make the world a better place rather than just preparing for the world to be a worse one. This journey will be a long one and there are many dangers along the way but I invite you to walk it with me.\n\nI have described this community as being one of the most optimistic and engaged of any I have come across and. The less technical pieces of my writing are essentially invitations to this ecosystem and culture. Their tone is welcoming. The picture I paint is alluring.\n\n>This is also the future. It\u2019s where fortunes are made, where an entire new financial system is being invented, and where exciting innovation is happening in games, art, culture, technology, and finance. In a depressing world, this is the most [optimistic culture](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole) I\u2019m aware of anywhere. I hope you will enjoy your time here.\n\n>If you\u2019re just approaching this space from the fringes what you have probably heard about is an endless stream of hacks and scams. It\u2019s true, there are multi-million dollar losses that occur on a seemingly weekly basis here. The finality guarantees mentioned above make fertile ground for attackers. It may surprise you then to hear that, culturally, this is the most [optimistic group](http://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-tide-of-technology/) of people I have ever encountered. Despite the potential for misuse and the constant threat of attack, the opportunities so far outweigh the risks that people are positively brimming with excitement. Drop by a hackathon at a conference sometime, the energy is palpable.\n\nSo I hope you don't think I have a narrative for Ethereum that ends with 'fuck you I got mine'. I do embrace a positive narrative for this technology. I just also build a forecast based on the data I see. My prevailing view is the world is getting worse quicker and quicker and I can't ignore that but that I'm going to focus what energies I can spare on the most significant fix to that I can find. I hope you agree this is *very* different from celebrating the collapse of society and becoming the new oligarch. I'm also not some Austrian economist, crypto-anarchist, etc that some people were arguing against in my post yesterday. I'm *sad* to see the direction of the world but limited in what I can do to stop it so I am forced to balance preparing for a worse world and making a better one. If I could make as much in web3 as I make leading an engineering team in web2 I think I would make the jump. That as yet hasn't been offered because my skills in web2 greatly exceed my resume for web3. So, I do what I can while also doing what makes sense.\n\nIf you want to join some of the true sources of light in this ecosystem you should look into the regenerative finance series with Kevin Owaki. There are carbon initiatives that you would like. There are identity initiatives required for governance transformations being worked on. I'm personally writing a bunch on governance if you go digging on my blog and my doots. I'm happy to have conversations most days on these topics with ethfinance. I'd love to see you initiate some of them.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think you&#39;re conflating separate topics. The first topic is a forecast for the world and the resources each of us will have access to. Just going by the data I see the outlook there is pessimistic. Even if all we do is project <a href=\"https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/\">the trends we have seen</a> in the past several decades forward the data indicates that the US is in decline and the lives of its citizens in 30 years will be worse off than today.</p>\n\n<p>The second topic is blockchain technology and its potential impact. My writing on this topic is far more positive. Even if everything I wrote yesterday comes true and the overall future state of world is bleak there will still be sources of hope and light within it. When looking at the sky we focus on the stars not the overwhelming darkness between them. This is how we stay sane, even if it is a coping mechanism. To me, this ecosystem is one of those points of light. The <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/human-coordination\">human coordination</a> post I linked in that post yesterday ends on a relatively optimistic tone despite using problems like global warming as a backdrop to highlight the significance of this technology.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That brings me back to my main point. This industry is the single most important thing any of us can be involved in. Your involvement, no matter how trivial, is contributing to one of the brightest and most significant technology trends in human history. If nothing else, your mere presence here makes you a data point. You can\u2019t walk this path and not leave footprints that help to guide others. Every step we take as an industry is charting territory. If you have received an airdrop, you are helping experiment with bootstrapping mechanisms. If you\u2019ve voted in a snapshot poll you\u2019ve helped improve the UX of governance solutions. If you lent or borrowed funds you\u2019ve indirectly funded a decentralized oracle. If you posted on Reddit or Twitter, you\u2019ve helped shape Layer 0. If you are here in this Rabbit Hole with me, you are invariably contributing to something significant.</p>\n\n<p>We are working to make the world a better place rather than just preparing for the world to be a worse one. This journey will be a long one and there are many dangers along the way but I invite you to walk it with me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have described this community as being one of the most optimistic and engaged of any I have come across and. The less technical pieces of my writing are essentially invitations to this ecosystem and culture. Their tone is welcoming. The picture I paint is alluring.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is also the future. It\u2019s where fortunes are made, where an entire new financial system is being invented, and where exciting innovation is happening in games, art, culture, technology, and finance. In a depressing world, this is the most <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole\">optimistic culture</a> I\u2019m aware of anywhere. I hope you will enjoy your time here.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re just approaching this space from the fringes what you have probably heard about is an endless stream of hacks and scams. It\u2019s true, there are multi-million dollar losses that occur on a seemingly weekly basis here. The finality guarantees mentioned above make fertile ground for attackers. It may surprise you then to hear that, culturally, this is the most <a href=\"http://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-tide-of-technology/\">optimistic group</a> of people I have ever encountered. Despite the potential for misuse and the constant threat of attack, the opportunities so far outweigh the risks that people are positively brimming with excitement. Drop by a hackathon at a conference sometime, the energy is palpable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I hope you don&#39;t think I have a narrative for Ethereum that ends with &#39;fuck you I got mine&#39;. I do embrace a positive narrative for this technology. I just also build a forecast based on the data I see. My prevailing view is the world is getting worse quicker and quicker and I can&#39;t ignore that but that I&#39;m going to focus what energies I can spare on the most significant fix to that I can find. I hope you agree this is <em>very</em> different from celebrating the collapse of society and becoming the new oligarch. I&#39;m also not some Austrian economist, crypto-anarchist, etc that some people were arguing against in my post yesterday. I&#39;m <em>sad</em> to see the direction of the world but limited in what I can do to stop it so I am forced to balance preparing for a worse world and making a better one. If I could make as much in web3 as I make leading an engineering team in web2 I think I would make the jump. That as yet hasn&#39;t been offered because my skills in web2 greatly exceed my resume for web3. So, I do what I can while also doing what makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to join some of the true sources of light in this ecosystem you should look into the regenerative finance series with Kevin Owaki.
