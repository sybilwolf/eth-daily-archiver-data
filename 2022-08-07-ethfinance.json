Well, kinda yes &amp; no, I think you&#39;re still looking at this the wrong way. You need to think in terms of ETH first. I&#39;d recommend a spreadsheet, however, the fundamentals are very very simple - the only key metric you need to know is <strong>baseline ETH.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Your baseline ETH is the <strong>original value</strong> of your investment <strong>denominated in ETH</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to now assume your strategy is to sell 100% of your accumulated awards &amp; never touch your initial investment. In which case the plan becomes simple:</p>\n\n<p><em>Sell all ETH appreciation above your original investment whenever you can.</em><br/>\n<em>Never sell in a way that decreases your initial investment.</em></p>\n\n<p>Just a spreadsheet with a few columns, buy &amp; sell data, profit taken denominated in USD, ETH, rETH.</p>\n\n<p>Your objective:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Find out how much your investment has appreciated denominated in ETH<br/>\n= (Current ETH value - Baseline ETH value)</li>\n<li>Use the Rocket Pool official website to calculate the value of your appreciated investment in rETH terms</li>\n<li>Sell that exact amount of rETH above to USD (cash out)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Remember your investment is appreciating in ETH terms, not in USD terms - USD can fluctuate in value.</p>\n\n<p>So your objective is to keep selling excessive ETH whenever you can.</p>\n\n<p>I realize that I might have made this sound complicated - but if this is still unclear, please let me know; I&#39;m determined to help you, from what I understand you&#39;re setup already for passive income &amp; just need to understand how to execute. If it still isn&#39;t clear I&#39;ll create &amp; break down a hypothetical scenario for you which will make sense if you study it hard enough.</p>\n\n<p>LMK</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-09 23:44:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ijos0wf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wi7icu","parent_id":"t1_ijonxo4","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/McPhearsonfud","body":"I like your determination!\n\nBut yes, it has just clicked, somehow I was thinking \"But I still have one ETH so I have to keep track of what I've already taken out\" but no.

Or maybe I&#39;m not being fair and they <em>are</em> angry, it&#39;s just that our social media overlords are using their finances to psychologically manipulate us and capitalize on that anger and redirect it to all the wrong places.
