These incentives <em>really</em> work to keep people online, to the point that we&#39;ve actually had to have informational campaigns about how it&#39;s <em>okay</em> to be offline now and then, because new stakers are so deathly afraid of it.</p>\n\n<p>This crazy high participation rate is all the more ironic given our terrible execution client diversity right now. Essentially everyone understands that being online is important, but apparently only 20% of the validator set understands that running minority clients is essential to <em>staying</em> online and attesting to the correct chain in the event of a client bug. If only stakers treated running a supermajority client with the same urgency that they do being offline, chain health would be immensely better.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-09 19:35:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ijo203v","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wjuhnb","parent_id":"t3_wjuhnb","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/barthib","body":"Could it be due to the best tutorial available to spin up a validator?

These recent market updates have become rather serialized I admit.</p>\n\n<p>A week or two ago, we looked at how market bottoms have formed since 2000 and found that on regular, bog standard corrections such as we&#39;ve seen thus far, the S&amp;P 500 index recovers its 100 Week moving average level on the <em>very next leg up</em> following a macro bottom. It&#39;s very close to doing that now, although not quite confirmed. </p>\n\n<p>However, when the rally immediately following a perceived bottom did NOT clear and confirm the 100 Week MA, it resulted in a lower low and a new bottom. Those times were January 2001 and May 2008, both failures leading to multi-year recessions.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-09 01:38:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ijk0x6i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wjuhnb","parent_id":"t1_ijjzfmc","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Dog_The_Explorer","body":"So either lambo or ramen confirmed by end of this week, got it!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So either lambo or ramen confirmed by end of this week, got it!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-09 01:56:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ijk27nt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wjuhnb","parent_id":"t1_ijk0x6i","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"We're definitely at the end of the road when it comes to what data, numbers, math, trends, and charts can help us with. \n\nMy luck?
