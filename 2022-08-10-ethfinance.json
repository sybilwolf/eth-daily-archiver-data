So discussion topic: What is your long-term vision for data and financial privacy on blockchains?\n\nI can't help but think that the fatal (regulatory) flaw of Tornado Cash was being an opt-in tool specifically for privacy. I tend to be fairly optimistic that (at least in the States) [people do care about their privacy](https://archive.epic.org/privacy/survey/), but there is a world of difference between passively hoping that companies/government will respect your wishes, and actively seeking out and using tools like Tornado Cash. So in the end TC only attracts money launderers and privacy enthusiasts, with a high enough amount of illegitimate use to justify sanctioning the whole thing.\n\nI would argue Monero and Zcash are in a slightly better spot because each can make claims to store-of-value or medium-of-exchange use cases. But they're still opt-in in a space with thousands of competing cryptocurrencies. The people who choose to use Monero/Zcash are those who make privacy a priority. Without a critical mass of legitimate users, the networks become dominated by money launderers and are easy to criticize and gain momentum to censor.\n\nThinking of a few non-blockchain situations, privacy-by-default has seen some success in encrypted Internet traffic (HTTPS) and smartphone encryption. It's hard to imagine a world without HTTPS, where anything you send online could be spied on. I'm curious if there was much government opposition to its original development, or if it was just obviously necessary for e.g. online banking. Modern smartphones encrypt themselves by default (though possibly only if the user opts to use a passphrase or fingerprint to unlock), and I know this has been a more hard-fought battle. But it seems at the moment it's caught on well enough, and perhaps has enough momentum to resist new restrictive legislation or government back doors.\n\n****\n\nBut back to blockchain. I think the vision I'd like to see is having the largest execution layer, with the greatest usage and strongest network effect, with a strong degree of privacy by default. Some sort of fancy pancy technology such that under normal operations it cannot be proven how many of any token any account has, or how many were transferred in any transaction. But while I'm dreaming here, this should also be a smart contract platform, where by either social consensus or technical requirement, DeFi protocols and DAOs retain the same degree of transparency they have today (and secured by a top-tier security/consensus layer; you may have one in mind already).\n\nBut the point is that the privacy needs to be the default, the standard that you get without thinking about it. You don't come for the privacy, you come for the network effect and the huge range of great composable dapps. For the general public, the privacy is just a nice bonus. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic, but I would imagine a government would face much more opposition in trying to censor such a platform.\n\nI don't know how we get to this point. I don't know if Ethereum is the best means to reach it. Maybe a really good L2 can pull it off, but so far I'm a little nervous that network effect is congregating around Arbitrum/Optimism (with no default privacy). Maybe I should look more into Aztec; I don't know much about it but doing a few quick searches now it sounds relevant.

Because of that I paid more and more attention to everything investments. Stocks and obviously in the last couple of months macro. </p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s confusing? I am stupid, but somehow I want the housing market to crash so I can buy a home for my family (also I have some stables left, but I can buy stuff whenever I want, so that&#39;s really not too important here). Obviously this would probably nuke not just my crypto investment, but also my business cause in a recession we make less money as well. </p>\n\n<p>I am rather sure that &quot;pre crypto&quot; this whole period wouldn&#39;t have really bothered me. I would have lived my life, recession so what? Oil up, that sucks, will come down eventually etc. But life doesn&#39;t work like that anymore and every day it&#39;s a bit clearer that I can&#39;t win all the time. Obviously it&#39;s most likely still stupid to hope for a crash (because the &quot;gains&quot; in the housing crash will be minor compared to the losses in crypto, my business and hence my emotional health) but still right now I want a house. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone in a similar spot or am I the only idiot in here? (probably am the only one :))</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-10 06:08:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ijppkkb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wkoo0i","parent_id":"t3_wkoo0i","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/strawdar","body":"Nah, you're not an idiot.
