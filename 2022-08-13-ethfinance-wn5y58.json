But I'm not sure what makes you think that MEV has any paths to resolution in the near future.\n\nSSLE doesn't help with MEV to my knowledge. It's designed to make it impossible to know which validators are proposing ahead of time, which prevents DDoS attacks.\n\nPBS is not an anti-MEV measure, but rather an acknowledgement that MEV is inevitable on public blockchains, and an attempt to segregate the centralization in block production that it promotes away from the consensus layer. Without it, validators need to run their own extremely heavy duty MEV block production software locally, or build networks of MEV transaction submitting users, and these are both things that have serious economies of scale, and hence heavily disadvantage small-time home validators in favor of large staking pools with the resources to do that heavy compute or user-network building. With MEV-boost initially, and full PBS later, we are separating that work entirely from the work that validators do, leaving them with the simple job of selecting the best-paying MEV payloads from their relays. They still profit from MEV, but there are no centralizing forces directly within the validator pool. A home validator stands to benefit just as much as a large staking pool under this model. The centralization and economies of scale resulting from MEV still exist exactly the same as they did before, but they have been pushed out to block producers. However, it has also established a *marketplace* for their MEV payloads, which means that block producers exist in competition with one another. Yes, there will be several dominant players in the space, but it's much less harmful there than if it's integrated with validators.\n\nIf you're personally against MEV as a concept, then I agree with you in principle - it sucks that users leak value unknowingly, and that others will sop up that value whenever they see it. But according to everything I've read, that's a permanent, inevitable feature of public blockchains. (Ethereum going fully zk-private might partially solve it, but to my knowledge there are no plans for this currently.) So we have to design our systems to account for it, and move on.\n\nBtw, I'm very strongly in favor of local block production still being possible for validators, so that anyone who *does* want to opt out of seeking MEV entirely (such as yourself) can do so in a decentralized manner. It's important to always have that option and fallback in case something goes wrong with MEV-boost or PBS. But as others pointed out, by not seeking MEV yourself, you are merely leaving it for other validators to collect, because the system, by design, incentivizes them to do so.\n\nThere has been some rather interesting discussion of \"good\" MEV versus \"bad\" MEV, with an example of the former being arbitrage between different DEXes, or liquidating margin-called vaults to maintain stablecoin pegs, and an example of the latter being sandwich attacks. Relays and block builders could in theory pledge to only accept \"good\" MEV transactions, and validators could select only relays having made such a pledge. You'd be foregoing some amount of MEV, but possibly (according to your own personal take on the \"good\" versus \"bad\" discussion) contributing to a more healthy ecosystem for the blockchain's users. I'd personally consider making such \"ethically motivated\" relay decisions myself in future.\n\nThe final interesting point is whether MEV-boost is ready for use in production. Personally I have doubts, especially as long as Flashbots is the only available relay, and *especially* if they were considering censoring, as they clearly were with the TC situation. I'd like to see a healthy ecosystem of several competing relays before feeling entirely comfortable with it.
