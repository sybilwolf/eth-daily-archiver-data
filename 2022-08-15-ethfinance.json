Seriously though\u2026?**\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot recently as I meet more of our ETHFinance fam IRL. Becoming a parent makes you think about these things too.

Your investments could mean life changing money. It could be generational wealth. \r  \n\r  \nI wouldn\u2019t consider myself a crypto wife anymore. Now, I\u2019m an investor in my *own* right. I don\u2019t understand ETH and DeFi to Logris\u2019 level\u2026 but really who does!? I asked an Ethereum wife, who I met recently, \u201cCan you get to the money? Do you even know where it is? Do you know who to ask or where to start?\u201d She seemed to think that she would be fine, but that might not be the case for everyone.\r  \n\r  \n*First, does your partner have a plan to get permission to the assets.*\r  \n\r  \nInclude the information in your will or at least leave some documentation with your lawyer or someone you trust. Make sure they know how important the private key(s) are and where it's stored. Do you have a safe/safe deposit box? Do they have access to it? Does your lawyer? Make a plan. We\u2019ve all heard the horror stories of people losing their private keys for their BitCoin. There\u2019s the guy in England still trying to search the dump for the hard drive with his private keys.\r  \n\r  \nHere\u2019s what we do. Logris has divided the private key into 3 separate locations. I can reconstruct the key with 2 out of the 3. I know the locations of all 3 of the pieces of the private key. Have you ever talked about something like this with your partner? \r  \n\r  \nQuestions to ask yourself: Would they know how to find the private key if something happened to you? Do they know what technology you use? Is your crypto in cold storage, a hot wallet, or on an exchange? \r  \n\r  \nSecond, does your partner understand where the assets are and how to redeem them.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ve got 3 points you need to think about, the 4th being optional.\r  \n\r  \n1. Have a system to track assets. \r  \n2. Share access to it.\r  \n3. They need to understand what it means.\r  \n4. (optional) You need someone you trust to help them. \r  \n\r  \n**1: First off, it's pretty simple. You need a system.** Co-worker once called it the \u201chit-by-bus\u201d scenario. If a catastrophic event happens and you never return to work--ie: you were hit by a bus. Could your job be pieced together from the documentation you left behind? It doesn't have to be very sophisticated. As you move money around the system \u2013 from protocol to protocol\u2013 track it. In our house, accounting is done on a monthly basis. Makes sense right? People pay bills on a monthly basis and usually review their budget and spending. We, also, talk about the crypto allocations on a monthly basis and any changes get tracked.\r  \n\r  \n**2. Have the system in a known location.** Use software that your partner is comfortable with. One that is also secure. Did I need to say that? Use 2FA if you want. Just make sure they can get to it if they need to. The more you show it to them the more comfortable they\u2019ll get with looking at it. (See previous statement about monthly discussion) They might get so comfortable that you can have them pull it up. In Learning and Development, we call this a \u201cteach a man to fish\u201d scenario. \r  \n\r  \n**3. Make it easy for them to understand.** It doesn't need to include addresses. Unless you want it to. Just make sure it has an account identifier, the asset, and the amount. You can make it as simple or as complicated as you like. Just make sure they understand it. Remember it\u2019s not just for you, it's for both of you. It helps to have a spreadsheet to look at rather than a bunch of different protocols. Even if they don\u2019t know Defi, most people can understand a spreadsheet. \r  \n\r  \n**4. Tell your partner where to go for help.** Use your community. We have an awesome community here. If something ever happened, I would immediately be asking y\u2019all for help to untangle whatever DeFi web Logris has created (he laughed). Maybe in my case it\u2019s different because of the crazy shit that Logris comes up with. Or maybe not? You can also designate a community member to be your \u201con call\u201d person. Logris is on retainer for one ethfinancier for just this reason.\r  \n\r  \nThis is some pretty basic stuff. You\u2019re probably investing in crypto because you\u2019re a believer. But, it\u2019s different from TradFi. You can show up at the bank with a death certificate and get access to a deceased loved one\u2019s accounts \u2013 if you know what bank they use. I don\u2019t have to explain to you that\u2019s not how the blockchain works. \r  \n\r  \nOn the blockchain, there\u2019s no one you can contact if your private keys get lost.

They accept traffic from other ISPs and pass it on to either the end-user or to another ISP. A block producer (miner or validator) simply accepts traffic from the mempool or relay network and passes it on to the validator/node network for inclusion in the chain. ISPs can even impact the order in which packets are transmitted according to their QoS and routing setups, just like block producers can impact the order of transactions. And yes, somewhere out there is an ISP that happily accepts money from Pirate Bay to transmit their data. \n\nISPs can even have access to the data inside each packet in some circumstances, yet they're still not expected to censor traffic except in places like China. \n\nIf anything, it's when you *start* to censor that the trouble begins.
