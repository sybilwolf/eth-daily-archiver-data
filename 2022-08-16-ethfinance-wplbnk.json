As a large entity, you can find MEV opportunities much more effectively than a small entity.\n\nIf we continue to expect validators to do their own MEV extraction (because they are currently the ones who build blocks, and are therefore in the position to extract it), then small-scale validators will fail to extract MEV, and will make a lot less money than large staking pools who have the resources to find and extract MEV. This, in turn, provides a strong incentive for people to *not* solo stake, but instead to stake with those pools. This would be catastrophic for decentralization.\n\nWe **need** block proposers and block builders to be two separate entities. This is called PBS (Proposer Builder Separation).\n\nThere are some nice in-protocol designs for PBS that we'll implement in the coming years, but the Merge is happening *next month*. Centralization due to MEV could start immediately at the Merge, if we don't figure out a first stab at PBS as soon as possible.\n\nMEV-boost is that first attempt at PBS. It is a neutral middleware that allows stakers to connect with \"relays\", which collect blocks optimized for MEV extraction as well as the usual tips, and pass them to whichever validator is currently proposing a block (and running MEV-boost), and pass on a large amount of the MEV profit to the validator.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it allows solo stakers to earn MEV on a level playing field with large staking providers. This, in turn, prevents the centralization risk posed by MEV from harming Ethereum at the validator level. Instead, the centralization can be concentrated with the relays and block builders that stakers use MEV-boost to connect to.\n\nIs MEV-boost a tool for censorship? **No**, except under very specific conditions. MEV-boost lets stakers choose which relays to connect to. It doesn't force stakers to accept censoring relays. Censorship is actually harmful to profits (by excluding potentially profitable transactions), so any rational, profit-motivated staker would not choose to use relays that provide censoring blocks. And even if they do, that's not the fault of MEV-boost, it's the fault of the staker for actively choosing to accept censoring blocks, and the fault of MEV as a concept for forcing users to accept externally-built blocks to remain competitive as a staker.\n\n(The specific conditions under which it could cause censorship are *if* the only available relays are censoring relays. E.g., if the relay run by Flashbots were the only relay, and if they include OFAC censorship, *then* anyone running MEV-boost would be contributing to censorship. But the goal going forward is for there to be a **vibrant ecosystem of different block builders and relays**, many of which will not censor transactions, and validators can choose to connect only to those.)\n\nAre blocks built locally by the validator the gold standard when it comes to decentralization and censorship resistance? **Yes**. Stakers who choose to not run MEV-boost are choosing to act altruistically in a way that is optimal for decentralization. **BUT**, those who choose to use MEV-boost with non-censoring relays are **equally** positive for the ecosystem, and more importantly, are able to maximize profits while still acting in a non-harmful way for the ecosystem.\n\nSo in short, deciding to not use MEV-boost on principle is only hurting your pocketbook, without necessarily improving the ecosystem.\n\nWhat you *should* do, as someone deciding what to do about MEV, is to carefully vet any relays you elect to connect to with MEV-boost, to make sure they are not censoring or otherwise behaving badly, whatever that may mean to you.\n\nMEV-boost is designed to support decentralization during the awkward gap between the Merge and the full PBS spec being implemented, and will do that successfully, as long as solo stakers using it do so carefully and thoughtfully.

Going to share what went wrong so others may learn from it (maybe not so much in this case, but a good habit I think).\n\nIn the year and a half since beacon chain genesis, I've been pleasantly surprised by the resiliency of the whole setup. It's generally been able to automatically recover itself from internet outages and power outages, and neither geth nor lighthouse have needed to be manually restarted outside of regular updates. And I could always VPN into the home router then SSH into the validator if I needed to do anything. So about a week ago, I was traveling abroad and got a notification that there was an internet outage back home. Okay, fine, it happens. But once my ISP told me the issue was resolved, I was still missing attestations and my VPN client wasn't getting any response from the router. Couldn't access anything else I'm hosting at home either. I tried what little else I could from the other side of the world, but in the end just had to accept the downtime until I could get back home.\n\nWhen I got home last night, I pulled up my router's web interface and poked around. I believe the issue was with dual-WAN failover settings. My router has an option to support two internet connections, and can be configured to treat one as the main connection with the other as a failover in case the first goes down. I had played around with this option earlier this year when my ISP gave me advance warning of an outage. I had hoped to use my android phone's 4G connection as that failover option. It didn't quite work at the time: carriers place phones behind some sort of NAT that messes with node peering.\n\nMy problem was that I left those router settings as they were. I incorrectly assumed that either 1) if there is no failover connection available (i.e. my phone isn't plugged in) that it won't failover in the first place, or 2) if it swaps to the failover connection, it will check the main connection periodically and swap to that when it comes back online. But instead, it swapped to my nonexistent failover connection, then just sat there blissfully unaware that the main connection came back online. It turns out I missed a[ checkbox called \"Allow failback\"](https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1037368/) which would have done what I expected (and probably should have been the default...).\n\nOr at least that's what I think. After fixing those settings, the router essentially rebooted itself to apply the new settings, so there's a chance it was just stuck in some weird state and needed a reboot to fix. I can't differentiate between them, but needing a reboot due to some mysterious unknown bug sounds unlikely.\n\n****\n\nIt took ~2 hours to sync up with the beacon chain and start attesting again, and probably 4 hours for geth to catch up. During this time, my i5-10400 was the bottleneck, network usage was pretty low. Seems to all be running as usual now, though I am certainly behind on client updates and need to get on that.\n\nI honestly don't know how I could have avoided this problem. Once I put those settings in place, any internet outage long enough to trigger failover would have gotten me in trouble, it's just unfortunate that it first happened when I was out of the country. Maybe I could have run some failure-recovery tests before leaving. Unplug the modem for a bit to make sure it can recover from that. It's just that I had over a year of occasional outages that were recovered from automatically without issue. Maybe I could have been more careful about playing around with router settings, but that too is a fairly regular occurrence that should only rarely cause problems. I guess at the very least moving ahead, I can try to adhere to a policy that when I specifically mess with router settings surrounding fundamental internet connectivity, I should do a test of internet connection loss recovery.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Just recovered from some prolonged downtime on my validator node.

Just as there's no FDIC insurance coming for you, there's no one to look at your death certificate and hand over control either. Once again, in crypto you are on your own.\n\nThese fall into two categories.\n\n1) Grant someone else your private key.\n\n2) Grant someone else access to your assets.\n\nThe advantage of granting someone access to your private key is it is a general solution. It doesn't require your assets are in a multi-sig in advance. It doesn't require a bunch of on-chain transactions to setup or maintain. There are multiple ways of accomplishing this though and protecting your private key. I'm going to go over what I would recommend.\n\nAt minimum you can divide your words up into 3+ parts. Out of these parts we construct shares that can be reassembled like a pirate treasure map. If you have 24 words, each share has 16 words and 8 missing words that exist in the other shares. For example:\n\nFragment 1: Words 1-16\n\nFragment 2: Words 1-8, 17-24\n\nFragment 3: Words 9-24\n\nThe downside of this approach is it *dramatically* lowers your security. If any share is stolen the remaining words can be brute forced in a reasonable amount of time on an AWS cluster. If you lose a fragment, you might have a year to detect it was stolen and then move your assets. Compare this to brute forcing all 24 words which has a realistic solve time of absolutely never and there is a big difference.\n\nTo solve this shortcoming we can apply something called [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing). Bunch of math aside what this does is it makes it so any share gives no information about the whole private key until the necessary number of shares are put together. There are multiple free software implementations of this. Generate some shares, they don't look like words any more. Now get that shit engraved in steel in case of fire or otherwise back them up in a durable way. Each share is put in a separate secure location like a bank vault, in the portrait of grandpa on the fireplace, dropped in the Mariana's Trench, put into orbit on the ISS, etc. Now communicate with whomever you wish to receive the assets the location of these shares. The location information is secret but *less secret* than the share itself and it should ultimately require a death certificate at some point to assemble enough shares.\n\nThere are a few downsides to this approach. First giving someone your private key is basically giving someone access to both your assets and your *identity*. You may prefer to be dead without someone playing weekend with Bernie's with your online identity. The other downside is, at the time of your death when your loved ones already have enough problems, the Shamir scheme above can require a pilgrimage to Mecca or something to form Voltron.\n\nSo, if you want something more practical and precise there are other options for you but they come with other costs and risks. The first is to use an Argent recovery wallet. This is basically a limited purpose multi-sig where the primary signer can do things as normal but the other signers can only change the primary signer address. Practically this means you're executing all of your transactions from a smart contract which will increase your gas costs and it means you can't call any contracts like Alchemix v2 that can only be called from an EOA or whitelisted contract address. That's annoying but maybe ok. As to the guardian wallets, you can either find someone you trust or use a ledger backed up with its private key in a place you'd normally put your Shamir's share.\n\nThe other option is to grant approval access to another wallet so upon your death all your ERC-20's can be airlifted. Now this may sound insane at first but the approval access can be granted to a smart contract that comes with certain rules. For example you could setup a dead man's switch contract that can only call those ERC-20 sends if you fail to send a transaction after some amount of time. The downside here is I don't know how that would access your ETH which doesn't have an approve step, your validators, or other contracts like veCRV that have non-transferrable assets. It's not the most general solution but it is one that doesn't push you into a smart contract wallet or require any significant effort or understanding from your loved ones if that dead man's switch contract has a keeper like a law firm.\n\nSo, now let's assume whomever has outlasted you has your assets. Do they have **any idea** what to do with them? Do they know what a [ePyvCurveLUSD-27DEC21](http://tokenomicsexplained.com/rate-speculation-platforms/) token is? Could they figure out that you have a rocket pool node being hosted on AllNodes and how to unstake that ETH? Would they be able to figure out that your vlCVX is in fact time-locked and can only be accessed after 16 weeks or in the case of Badger's CVX once every full moon in the witching hour between sunset and dark? There's no smart contract magic that is going to solve this one for you. You need to leave a decipherable map to your assets and you need to communicate regularly. If any of the above looked like hieroglyphs to you, imagine how you're loved ones are going to feel trying to make sense of [the Rabbit Hole](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole) without the countless hours on Ethfinance. The best advice I have on this is to make sure your loved ones know about a place like this where they can ask for help. One ethfinancier has me on retainer for this purpose. There are some people like JT or some of our BeachBums who I'd help out of gratitude. Again, communication is the key here. They don't need to know everything, they just need to know who they can trust to ask.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>With my wife planning for my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/woqr6p/daily_general_discussion_august_15_2022/ikcsl28/\">inevitable demise</a> I wanted to follow up with ways by which you can bequeath your net worth to another in crypto.
