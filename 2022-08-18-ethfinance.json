Example from traditional futures: I will need 100 tons of wheat in the winter for my bakery and do not want to speculate on the price, just lock in the current one. I might win if the price goes up or lose if it goes down, but I leave that business for the traders. This goes the other direction too, i.e. selling wheat. These days there are more futures products on non-commodity instruments, e.g. interest rates, foreign exchange, stocks, indices, cryptos, volatility, weather, carbon emissions etc.\n\nOptions give you the right but not the obligation to buy/sell something at a given price (the so-called strike price) at or before (2) a pre-agreed date. Example: I want to be able to buy 100 tons of wheat at some fixed price in the winter, but I'm not sure yet that I actually need it. So I buy an option and pay the seller a premium for giving me this opportunity. If the price goes above the strike price at or before (2) the agreed date, I can exercise the option, which means I buy it from the seller cheaper than current market price. If the market price is below my strike price, I cannot exercise the option (and would make no sense anyway), and it expires. Similarly to futures, options can have a wide variety of underlying products: stocks, indices, commodities, currencies etc. **including options-on-futures, also called Futures Options (FOPs)**.\n\nSo, to answer the question, it is not bad reporting. CME will launch options on Ether futures. To substitute into my above example, the wheat would be an Ether futures contract in this case. So if someone buys such an option, they will have the right but not the obligation to buy/sell 100 Ether futures contracts. This is a derivative of a derivative.\n\nBoth can be used for various simple or complex trades: directional speculation, volatility capture, hedging, insurance. Also, there are lots of nuances in different contract specifications, e.g. in exercise style, margin configuration, or settlement price calculation. There are some very exotic instruments in this field, and that's one reason I like derivatives.\n\n(1) In reality the future price is always a bit different to the spot price due to the cost of carry (e.g. storing the wheat for 6 months has warehouse costs etc.) and expectations of market participants about future movements.\n\n(2) American-style options can be exercised anytime before or at the expiry date if the strike price is above or below (depending on call/put - i.e. buy/sell option). European-style options can be exercised at the expiry date only. There are many other exotic types as well, e.g. Asian or Bermuda options.\n\nEdit: typo","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Options and futures are different.</p>\n\n<p>Futures allow you to lock in the current (1) price of an asset for delivery on a pre-agreed future date. Example from traditional futures: I will need 100 tons of wheat in the winter for my bakery and do not want to speculate on the price, just lock in the current one. I might win if the price goes up or lose if it goes down, but I leave that business for the traders. This goes the other direction too, i.e. selling wheat. These days there are more futures products on non-commodity instruments, e.g. interest rates, foreign exchange, stocks, indices, cryptos, volatility, weather, carbon emissions etc.</p>\n\n<p>Options give you the right but not the obligation to buy/sell something at a given price (the so-called strike price) at or before (2) a pre-agreed date. Example: I want to be able to buy 100 tons of wheat at some fixed price in the winter, but I&#39;m not sure yet that I actually need it. So I buy an option and pay the seller a premium for giving me this opportunity. If the price goes above the strike price at or before (2) the agreed date, I can exercise the option, which means I buy it from the seller cheaper than current market price. If the market price is below my strike price, I cannot exercise the option (and would make no sense anyway), and it expires. Similarly to futures, options can have a wide variety of underlying products: stocks, indices, commodities, currencies etc. <strong>including options-on-futures, also called Futures Options (FOPs)</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So, to answer the question, it is not bad reporting. CME will launch options on Ether futures. To substitute into my above example, the wheat would be an Ether futures contract in this case. So if someone buys such an option, they will have the right but not the obligation to buy/sell 100 Ether futures contracts. This is a derivative of a derivative.</p>\n\n<p>Both can be used for various simple or complex trades: directional speculation, volatility capture, hedging, insurance. Also, there are lots of nuances in different contract specifications, e.g. in exercise style, margin configuration, or settlement price calculation. There are some very exotic instruments in this field, and that&#39;s one reason I like derivatives.</p>\n\n<p>(1) In reality the future price is always a bit different to the spot price due to the cost of carry (e.g. storing the wheat for 6 months has warehouse costs etc.) and expectations of market participants about future movements.</p>\n\n<p>(2) American-style options can be exercised anytime before or at the expiry date if the strike price is above or below (depending on call/put - i.e. buy/sell option).
