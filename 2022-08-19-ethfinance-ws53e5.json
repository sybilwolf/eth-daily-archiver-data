Remember don&#39;t start the Geth without deleting the clean trie cache otherwise the entire database may be damaged!</code>  Well damn, a bit too late for that, or so I thought.  </p>\n\n<p>Stopped geth and tried the prune again.  Same error message, pruning doesn&#39;t continue.  I inspect the geth source code and see that this error message is intended for the case where the user has an alternative directory for the trie cache that is not found by the pruning process, so this doesn&#39;t really apply to me.  Geth tries to delete this directory when pruning and stalls with the message if it isn&#39;t found.  So I manually create the <code>triecache</code> folder in my geth working directory and prune again.  </p>\n\n<p>A number of minutes pass.  Suddenly I see <code>Pruning state data</code>.  YES IT&#39;S WORKING!  I let it continue another couple of hours, meanwhile my validator misses a few attestations here and there due to increased CPU load.  Finally the pruning completes.  Check my disk space, &gt;1TB free!  NICE.  Start back up geth and I&#39;m done.  Onwards to the merge.  </p>\n\n<p>tldr: tried to prune geth, power failure halfway through, looked at geth source code to figure out how to continue. success. saved ~700GB without having to resync.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-19 19:29:47","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-08-19 19:33:54","id":"il0oz9w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ws53e5","parent_id":"t3_ws53e5","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/icevermin","body":"Get a UPS","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Get a UPS</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-19 19:57:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"il0s88j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ws53e5","parent_id":"t1_il0oz9w","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/tornato7","body":"You should try Besu with Snap Sync and automatic pruning!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You should try Besu with Snap Sync and automatic pruning!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-19 20:07:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"il0tg01","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ws53e5","parent_id":"t1_il0oz9w","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/not-ngmi","body":"Fully support switching to a minority client, but just adding that geth will have online pruning soon too","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Fully support switching to a minority client, but just adding that geth will have online pruning soon too</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-19 20:34:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"il0whvo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ws53e5","parent_id":"t1_il0tg01","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/bbqcaramelbrulee","body":"You were cool as a cuecomber... nice work!

Long time no see :))\n\nI haven\u2019t posted or been on Reddit in a while, really got sucked into Twitter during the 2020 bull (initially went there to battle FUD). Anyway EthTrader and then EthFinance was such a huge part of my life for many years. For those old and new, I\u2019m going to briefly tell you all my tale. Just a condensed version of the ping ponging euphoria and despair that has been my crypto journey. I\u2019m going to leave out many wins and losses and just give you the big moments, then ask a question/seek advice\n\nI should also preface this with the fact that I am NOT a trader. I suffer from paralyzing indecision and it\u2019s a true miracle I ever got in with the size I did when I did\n\nSo with that in mind\u2026.A friend of mine who is a brilliant dev and just all around GREAT person (quite sure some of y\u2019all know him) introduced me to ETH last cycle, around 42. Before then I had been interested in crypto but never invested. Despite being a conservative investor by nature, and quite risk averse, I took my first size bet on a speculative asset. Made and subsequently lost a fortune on the ride from 42-1400-80. I invested with the intent of holding until PoS. Granted, at the time, my time horizon for that happening was Lubinly off \n\nI did manage to exit my initial investment around 285, but making and then losing more money than I could ever dream of acquiring messed me up lol\n\nOnwards tho. I held and added a bit through that long brutal bear, never truly lost my hold conviction, managed to never get shaken out, but I did lose my buying conviction at the lows (haha :/ ) \n\nWhen we first broke above 400 in 2020, I was certain that it was indeed showtime once again. Losing a literal fortune in paper gains last cycle taught me a great lesson, so after the push above previous ATH I began to DCA out. Regardless of how much I sold, I was still going to keep a core validator stack. \n\nAfter nearly 5 years of obsessively following everything and holding despite wild swings in price and emotion, I had FINALLY realized profit, a true life changing amount of money for me. \n\nAs I was selling tho, that same friend that put me on to ETH introduced me to Terra. Before going further, it should also be said that I harbor zero resentment and place no blame with him for the choices I made base on his recommendation\n\nSo, I got into LUNA around 6. I profited greatly on that, and I sold quite a bit to lock in those profits. My downfall tho\u2026despite the red flags and historic outcomes of all of its algo stable predecessors, I ultimately drank the koolaide and truly believed UST would bend but not break\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen right away. I was conservative (relatively speaking) at first. For a long time I only kept ~10% of my stable holdings in UST. Late spring/early summer of 2021 UST did indeed bend but not break. That gave me more confidence and, when combined with the 18-20% bait from anchor, lead me to make a fatal mistake in risk management \n\nSince I had taken MASSIVE amounts of profit on ETH, and with growing confidence in UST\u2019s ability to return to 1, I decided anchor was a good way to help pay that tax bill\n\nImportant for y\u2019all to know this did not happen over night. It was a gradual process in which I continued to add to my UST position as I became increasingly drunk off the anchor gains\n\nTo cut to the point, ultimately, nearly ALL of the profit I took from this bull eventually ended up in UST/anchor. And to make matters worse, I utilized AAVE and borrowed USDC against my remaining ETH, swapped to UST, and bridged to Terra\n\nIn the end, I was/am nearly completely wiped out, left with nothing but a MONSTER tax bill and the remainder of my ETH locked in a prison of my own greedy design\n\nThrough taking out a personal loan and trading this bounce off the bottom, I have managed to get my AAVE debt down to a reasonable amount that can weather a similar 2018/19 style bear, complete with a similar drop\n\nNow, with all of that out of the way, here comes my question.

Long time no see :))</p>\n\n<p>I haven\u2019t posted or been on Reddit in a while, really got sucked into Twitter during the 2020 bull (initially went there to battle FUD). Anyway EthTrader and then EthFinance was such a huge part of my life for many years. For those old and new, I\u2019m going to briefly tell you all my tale. Just a condensed version of the ping ponging euphoria and despair that has been my crypto journey. I\u2019m going to leave out many wins and losses and just give you the big moments, then ask a question/seek advice</p>\n\n<p>I should also preface this with the fact that I am NOT a trader. I suffer from paralyzing indecision and it\u2019s a true miracle I ever got in with the size I did when I did</p>\n\n<p>So with that in mind\u2026.A friend of mine who is a brilliant dev and just all around GREAT person (quite sure some of y\u2019all know him) introduced me to ETH last cycle, around 42. Before then I had been interested in crypto but never invested. Despite being a conservative investor by nature, and quite risk averse, I took my first size bet on a speculative asset. Made and subsequently lost a fortune on the ride from 42-1400-80. I invested with the intent of holding until PoS. Granted, at the time, my time horizon for that happening was Lubinly off </p>\n\n<p>I did manage to exit my initial investment around 285, but making and then losing more money than I could ever dream of acquiring messed me up lol</p>\n\n<p>Onwards tho. I held and added a bit through that long brutal bear, never truly lost my hold conviction, managed to never get shaken out, but I did lose my buying conviction at the lows (haha :/ ) </p>\n\n<p>When we first broke above 400 in 2020, I was certain that it was indeed showtime once again. Losing a literal fortune in paper gains last cycle taught me a great lesson, so after the push above previous ATH I began to DCA out. Regardless of how much I sold, I was still going to keep a core validator stack. </p>\n\n<p>After nearly 5 years of obsessively following everything and holding despite wild swings in price and emotion, I had FINALLY realized profit, a true life changing amount of money for me. </p>\n\n<p>As I was selling tho, that same friend that put me on to ETH introduced me to Terra. Before going further, it should also be said that I harbor zero resentment and place no blame with him for the choices I made base on his recommendation</p>\n\n<p>So, I got into LUNA around 6. I profited greatly on that, and I sold quite a bit to lock in those profits. My downfall tho\u2026despite the red flags and historic outcomes of all of its algo stable predecessors, I ultimately drank the koolaide and truly believed UST would bend but not break</p>\n\n<p>That didn\u2019t happen right away. I was conservative (relatively speaking) at first. For a long time I only kept ~10% of my stable holdings in UST. Late spring/early summer of 2021 UST did indeed bend but not break. That gave me more confidence and, when combined with the 18-20% bait from anchor, lead me to make a fatal mistake in risk management </p>\n\n<p>Since I had taken MASSIVE amounts of profit on ETH, and with growing confidence in UST\u2019s ability to return to 1, I decided anchor was a good way to help pay that tax bill</p>\n\n<p>Important for y\u2019all to know this did not happen over night. It was a gradual process in which I continued to add to my UST position as I became increasingly drunk off the anchor gains</p>\n\n<p>To cut to the point, ultimately, nearly ALL of the profit I took from this bull eventually ended up in UST/anchor. And to make matters worse, I utilized AAVE and borrowed USDC against my remaining ETH, swapped to UST, and bridged to Terra</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I was/am nearly completely wiped out, left with nothing but a MONSTER tax bill and the remainder of my ETH locked in a prison of my own greedy design</p>\n\n<p>Through taking out a personal loan and trading this bounce off the bottom, I have managed to get my AAVE debt down to a reasonable amount that can weather a similar 2018/19 style bear, complete with a similar drop</p>\n\n<p>Now, with all of that out of the way, here comes my question. I have the means to dip into my \u201cuntouchable\u201d funds and repay the remainder of my AAVE debt. I don\u2019t really want to do this as my asset/debt ratio is such that I\u2019m not at risk of losing my ETH regardless of if more real/brutal pain is to come. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, if there is a potential PoW-based Ethereum fork, and with the near totality of my ETH being locked in AAVE, would I not receive that PoW coin? I have no belief in the future of a PoW ETH coin, but, just like ETC-ETH or BCH-BTC, there <em>might</em> be some value to capture there. My question to y\u2019all (just wanting clarification), my ETH in AAVE would not be eligible to potentially capture that specific play, right? If no, then I\u2019m seriously considering touching my untouchable funds so I can unlock that potential</p>\n\n<p>What say you friends?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-19 09:29:14","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-08-19 12:51:38","id":"ikyb5v4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ws53e5","parent_id":"t3_ws53e5","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/skandalouslsu","body":"Trying to fix the consequences of a series of bad decisions by making another bad decision doesn't sound like a smart play to me.
