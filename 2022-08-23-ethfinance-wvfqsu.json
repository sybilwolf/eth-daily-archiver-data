We all had some fun times with 1 week long liquidity farming extravaganzas like YFI and YAM. Then we watched that evolve into hyper-inflationary longer term farming like OHM or KLIMA. These things were successful at generating hype in a bull-market when greed was the primary emotion but now we've seen the long term collapse of pretty much all of these high issuance strategies. Now that that era has clearly passed it's a good time to talk about what might be a more fundamentally sound basis for issuance.\n\nThe thing about issuance is it debases existing holders. I personally tally it as a cost. I have a good example of this in my old [ALCX post](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/alcx). Basic thought exercise, if everyone gets 100% more of a token by farming it over a year intuitively the benefit of your own farming should be exactly canceled by the issuance given to everyone else. You should work out the formula for that as a homework. Long story short, hyper-inflationary tokens are just doing unnecessary rebases and obscuring their costs through complexity. It's borderline dishonest and you could smell that a mile away from some 100%+ APR if you weren't blinded by your greed.\n\nHowever, I still don't think MKR style systems with no issuance are objectively *better*. Issuance does serve a *purpose* and it's worth recognizing what that purpose is and using it appropriately as a tool. I wrote recently about the fundamental rights of the [capital layer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/wliv6s/daily_general_discussion_august_11_2022/ijtvcz1/?context=3). In there I discussed several points that intersect the topic of inflation.\n\n1) A battery. Price is a form of charge and issuance allows you to drain charge from your battery even if there isn't a treasury to draw from. In that sense it's kind of like debt. This is useful if you're like ETH where you want a constant budget for something like security but have an unstable form of revenue from network usage. It can also be useful as a bootstrap mechanism to draw charge before you would have collateral to get a loan by other means.\n\n2) Marketing. This was the main motivator for the massive inflation waves that defined the last bull market. High APR's got attention whether it was deserved or not. Hundreds of millions of dollars of liquidity would get dumped into some basically untested code. While the way we went about it as a community was reckless and DAOs like Bancor are reaping the consequences of that today this tool can be used responsibly and as a net positive for a DAO.\n\nAnother point I didn't mention there that is pretty obvious in this context is issuance is a form of compensation. People can hold them speculatively or cash out of them but regardless tokens are used just like stock as a portion of a compensation package for contributing to a DAO. This can be formal like if you're a developer drawing a salary or it can be a permissionless relationship like if you're a market maker. When we talk about compensation though we quickly arrive into the territory of justice, fairness, and law and these things become subjective and less usually less formalized. I have seen literally no formalized answers to the question of stock issuance to employees so point me to one if you have a good citation. \n\nAs a basic example, the earlier I join a project generally the higher the risk that venture will fold and my tokens will be worth nothing. How much should I be compensated for that risk in addition to fair compensation for my efforts alone? If someone joins a project several years later than me how should their compensation be adjusted for assuming lower risk than I did? A maximally equitable solution would give us equal tokens for equal work but this fails to attract initial entrants to the project. It fails at the marketing use case of issuance and the product fails to bootstrap itself unless there are other motivations for the work to attract people. A typical VC style compensation gives exponentially more ownership to the early contributors. This bootstraps well but doesn't transition well to an ownership economy because the available dilution by the time the project has its S-Curve moment isn't sufficient to hand a controlling interest to the users.\n\nThis problem reminds me of something I've seen in my time in AI called [multi-armed bandits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit). They are used for drug trials to maximize the information gained by the trial and do the most good for the most people. I use them to balance traffic amongst different AI models to maximize the impact of the AI system. They formalize a balance of exploration and exploitation and the need to *remember* against the need to *forget*. This is especially important in the case when you are measuring time-dependent variables (e.g. markets). In our case inflation, via debasement, is \"forgetting\" the contributions of previous contributors. Under use of inflation as a marketing tool stifles adoption and undermines the longer term goals of the ownership economy to have decentralized ownership to harden the DAO against the key-man risks of regulation (of particular note lately), contributors leaving, corruption, etc. Over using this tool pisses off whoever is diluted. When they are a necessary actor in your ecosystem this is a bad thing to do. Just like with market-making, somewhere in between is the Goldilocks zone of useful inflation that is a tolerable cost offset by the growth it enables.\n\nMy impression is that in traditional companies the stock package given to employees is determined by market supply and demand of labor. If this is the best answer we have, it seems like a ripe area for Defi to disrupt by encoding what was previously an unfair, opaque system with a provably fair on-chain one governed by a few parameters and the right oracle.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Been thinking about inflation and bootstrapping.

So what you're really implying is that you can negotiate what share of inflation goes to what party which seems correct to me. What I'm pondering in my post is whether we can rely on a formulaic on-chain solution to this question rather than black magic and luck. Draw a parallel to how APR on money markets is a function of perceived risk that is solved algorithmically and permissionlessly. Can the inflation rates given to DAO participants be solved in an analogous way? I think it might be possible.\n\nThe phrase that brought ML to mind here is just balancing the need to remember against the need to forget. I think that's a very powerful phrase that's applicable to many things in life. Even just identifying that there is a need to *forget* in life was a foreign concept to me before I studied these things. In AI this can be implemented by providing more weight to more recent data and discounting older data. In just living your life, we need to forgive others their past failures so we can see them as they are now. Otherwise after every failure they would be better off just severing ties and starting in some new situation without that baggage. In a DAO, people will perceive it as unjust if I can never hope to earn as much influence in their lifetime as someone else did in a hour once upon a time. BTC mining is this way right? Each block used to provide [50 BTC](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048). Surely early adopters took more risk and deserve more reward, but at what point is it just unjust that they earned like $5 million for running a program on their laptop at a conference when they heard about Bitcoin once decades ago. So I think there's a fundamental aspect to justice and fairness in this \"need to forget\" that should be enshrined in our tokenomics designs and I think inflation is a friendlier alternative to rebasing or clawbacks to achieve it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I agree the market rate to retain sufficient capital vs labor is independent but if you&#39;re holding a token you get debased the same whether you earned that token through labor or capital. So what you&#39;re really implying is that you can negotiate what share of inflation goes to what party which seems correct to me. What I&#39;m pondering in my post is whether we can rely on a formulaic on-chain solution to this question rather than black magic and luck. Draw a parallel to how APR on money markets is a function of perceived risk that is solved algorithmically and permissionlessly. Can the inflation rates given to DAO participants be solved in an analogous way? I think it might be possible.</p>\n\n<p>The phrase that brought ML to mind here is just balancing the need to remember against the need to forget. I think that&#39;s a very powerful phrase that&#39;s applicable to many things in life. Even just identifying that there is a need to <em>forget</em> in life was a foreign concept to me before I studied these things. In AI this can be implemented by providing more weight to more recent data and discounting older data. In just living your life, we need to forgive others their past failures so we can see them as they are now. Otherwise after every failure they would be better off just severing ties and starting in some new situation without that baggage. In a DAO, people will perceive it as unjust if I can never hope to earn as much influence in their lifetime as someone else did in a hour once upon a time. BTC mining is this way right? Each block used to provide <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048\">50 BTC</a>.

No matter how much I yelled or commanded he did whatever he wanted anyway. Consequences be damned! He infuriated me at times with his stubbornness, but that was just him and he was impossible not to love. When he was only a few months old he got out of our fence and chased some cows across a field. He was the size of my shoe but those cows ran so fast!\n\nHe was also the smartest dog I have ever known. I know I\u2019m biased but he did things that I have never seen any other dog do. He built an entire tunnel system in the big grass in our backyard. During the winter when the grass was dead and not that thick he would dig out clearings in the middle. Then when the grass grew the next summer he could hide inside and no one could see him! He worked on this every year, making another clearing and a tunnel between them until he had entrances and exits all over. He would run full speed into the grass and then pop out a random side! It was his magic trick! We would be looking for him and he\u2019d be hiding in there sleeping. He master planned his own fort and built it over many years. He made his own playground. *Brick by brick*\n\nHe showed it to everyone that came over, running in and out random sides, and he shared it with any dog that dared go in. He never had a problem sharing anything with any other dog that came over, he loved sharing his fort and toys and bones, his whole beautiful life, with other dogs. He encouraged them to enjoy it and showed them how to have fun with them. He showed them where to get water and food. He was spoiled but he knew it, so he was giving and kind. Thats one of many stories I have. He was just amazingly amazingly smart, cunning and wise. I have no doubt in the wild be would have been the alpha despite his lanky build. Brains over brawn.\n\nHe was an explorer like his sister, but much more curious and inquisitive. Like her, he loved the great outdoors. Often times we\u2019d have to force him into the car at the state park when it was time to go. We always joked he\u2019s the only dog that wants to be an outside dog. He would howl in sync with fire or ambulance sirens, even matching their tempo and pitch. We called it his warble. He would do this with his head out the car window while we were going down the road. I could see people laughing, taking pictures. Lol! It was great. He brought smiles to thousands of people over the years, maybe even made their day a little better and he didn\u2019t even know it. That was just him though, so much personality\u2026 you couldn\u2019t NOT love him instantly. I won\u2019t be able to hear those sirens without thinking about him for the rest of my life \u2026 and that\u2019s just one of many beautiful gifts he gave to us.\n\nHe lived life to the fullest until the very last day. He was able to go quietly and peacefully with his family by his side, in his home in his favorite spot on the couch and he deserved all of that and more.

It requires a modification to the fork choice rule that says the head of the chain is the one that has the most work and no transactions I don't want to see. In PoS is very similar, you need to change the code but instead of weighted by work is weighted by attestations but the key modification is the same. Ignore any fork that includes transactions I want to censor. They seem to be assuming that this can be implemented in PoS and not in PoW for some reason. It's the same change. Can be implemented in both. It's not even a hard fork that Bitcoin's social layer could protect you from, it's a soft fork which means that it's coercive towards those not wanting to implement it.\n\n3.

In PoW the \"stake\" is something external and physical, you cannot destroy it in-protocol and worst case it can be repossessed by a nation-state which in turn gives them control of the block production. The solution here would be to change the protocol to invalidate the existing mining rigs.\n\nRegarding pools. Miners can point their hashrate to a different mining pool if they don't like their mining pool behaves. Stakers can do the same, eventually, they cannot do that now because unstaking is blocked but when it's unblocked they will be able to.

I guess you could say that with PoS, the pool who forks away will get slashed and have its stake reduced but like I pointed out above, this may cause a lot of problems as such slashing affects many small holders.</p>\n\n<p>The crux of this issue then is that while the punishment for undesirable behavior by validators in PoS is &#39;slashing of stake&#39;, they really may not have a lot at stake themselves as their stake is made up of custodying other&#39;s coins.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-23 04:24:17","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-08-23 04:39:41","id":"ilfxcjy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wvfqsu","parent_id":"t1_ilfvlpm","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/epic_trader","body":"> if the US Pow miners were forced to create a new chain of compliant blocks then they would end up mining a new coin\n\nThis is probably a bit of a reach.
