Ive since installed a fresh metamask on a different browser on a different laptop, but am still getting extremely high fees despite the current low gwei.</p>\n\n<p>Basic cost of the extension on ENS domains is 0.006 Eth, but gas costs are around 0.39 Eth!</p>\n\n<p>Im at my wits end, as the registration runs out soon and i obviously dont want to pay $600 to renew!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/oLba3kT\">https://imgur.com/oLba3kT</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit: This seems to be an issue with the extension period that im choosing in the ENS domain app. If I choose to only extend by 1 year instead of \u22652 years, then the gas fee drops dramatically to around $3. This seems to be because I dont have enough funds in the account to cover the cost of extending for more than 1 year and its making the contract go bananas on the gas fee. I wanted to play around with the numbers before adding funds, but it seems the app isnt happy with this.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/zKCh1r4\">https://imgur.com/zKCh1r4</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-24 11:56:34","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-08-24 13:11:31","id":"ilmpy7o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wwaf75","parent_id":"t3_wwaf75","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/maninthecryptosuit","body":"Click where it says \"Market\" with the fox icon, and change the gas fee manually to what you see in [gasprice.io](https://gasprice.io)\n\nRight now I would put 15 gas fee (FAST option on gasprice.io) and it would go through in < 1 minute.\n\nWhy this is happening: Metamask is sometimes horrible at estimating gas fees.

Sidenote--it was so contentious it was unclear which one was going to be the \"real\" Bitcoin (Coinbase even put up a blog [clarifying that they would decide which one was \"Bitcoin\" based on hash difficulty](https://blog.coinbase.com/clarification-on-the-upcoming-segwit2x-fork-d3c0f545c3e0)).
