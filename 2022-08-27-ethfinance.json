If I have 1 Eth staked in CB and convert it to 1 cbEth, I go from having 1 regular Eth valued at $1500 to 0.9939 cbEth valued at $1378. I take an 8% loss just for the conversion and gas. Ouch. \n\nI could then use my cbEth and trade it to back to Eth which incurs a CB swap/gas fee, then stake it somewhere else. \n\nI guess if I chose RocketPool and had enough for a minipool, I suppose it would make sense over the long term to take the short term loss.
