I'm still in the midst of taking a break from Reddit and other social media until Bellatrix rolls around, but believe it or not, I'm posting here today for work! :D\n\nCrypto is all about incentive alignment. If you want users to act in a positive manner for your project or ecosystem, make sure you've properly incentivized them to do so. With proper incentives in place, users will even materialize out of thin air to play whatever role you want them to! \n\nThis can become very much of a virtuous cycle, as users interact with your project, help turn its gears, and eventually go from \"anonymous entities running software or submitting transactions in exchange for payments\" to **community members**. And as we know, a strong community (aka Layer 0!) is by far the most important asset any ecosystem can have. \n\nIn software development one of the roles that very frequently needs filling is that of *tester*. This can span the gamut from QA specialists down to strangers pulled in off the street to help with user testing. Traditional user testing involves either finding volunteers to help test your software, or finding paid user testers, often through a centralized user testing company. This can have a lot of friction and of course, the usual losses to middlemen.\n\nCrypto has been implicitly disrupting this model since basically its inception. By incentivizing users to play certain roles, often involving new software or smart contracts, they are implicitly being asked to test that software. But very frequently, the fact that the software is under development is not made clear. Testing in production is extremely common in this space, and people very frequently use real assets for what is fundamentally user testing, because they are told they're using production-ready software.\n\nA more ethical approach to testing is **incentivized user testing**. The Influence team (which I'm a part of) has been calling this **Test-to-Earn** (a bit of a pun on \"play-to-earn\"). This is arguably better because users are told upfront that they're using software that's still in development, with bugs likely. More than that, the software they are testing is deployed to a testnet, so they are not risking real assets in their testing. But, and this is crucial, *they are still incentivized with real value*. It's not just testnet money they're being paid with, but mainnet money. \n\nWith Test-to-Earn, users can safely put your in-development software through its paces, earning real incentives while not risking any real assets except their own time. We really hope that other web3 projects adopt this model, where users can explicitly sign up to be guinea pigs, and production-ready software has already gone through extensive user testing on testnets before receiving the stamp of approval. A lot of crypto so far has been \"use at your own risk\", and this is part of what makes it fun, but as we start transitioning into the mainstream, we feel a higher standard of user testing may be warranted, and Test-to-Earn is a crypto-native way of accomplishing it without rent-seeking middlemen, and allowing literally anyone on the planet with an internet connection and some spare time to participate and potentially earn money.\n\nUltimately, a successful Test-To-Earn program can also result in massive growth for your community!\n\nWe've now reached the shill part of my post :) I work on the team for Influence, an Ethereum/StarkNet Web3-native open economy science fiction game. We've launched Phase 2 of our Test-to-Earn program today - please help us to test some new features of the game, including L1 <-> L2 bridging! If you've wanted an excuse to try out StarkNet, now's your chance. And yes, it's incentivized! For details, read here: https://influenceth.substack.com/p/test-to-earn-launches-now-a03\n\nSide note, we're pretty sure we're giving StarkNet one of the heaviest periods of user testing it's yet seen!\n\nAnyway, jumping off of Reddit again until the 6th.
