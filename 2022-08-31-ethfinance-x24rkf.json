We know a significant hit on new cards sold has been triggered during Q2 due to NVIDIA quarterly results but not earlier (revenue drop from Q1 to Q2 of 44% is huge). So at least some are slowing down on CapEx. But they seem to keep mining instead of trying to front-run a sell off of GPUs on the market. So perhaps they intend to go mine other stuff after, what they will likely encounter is that there won&#39;t be revenue to extract in the rest of the ethhash chains so a few months after they will have to sell their used cards or retire them. </p>\n\n<p>There is also the ASIC hashrate on to the mix. I don&#39;t have any estimates how much hashrate they represent. This hashrate is unlikely to be turned-off until the end as the ASICs cannot be used for any other purpose than mining and anything else is less profitable. So at a minimum ASICs will get us to TTD.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-01 00:53:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"immsmma","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x24rkf","parent_id":"t1_imm265k","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/decibels42","body":"For the stakers out there running Geth into the merge:\n\n*Run The Majority Client at Your Own Peril*\n\nhttps://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2022/03/24/run-the-majority-client-at-your-own-peril.html\n\nTLDR: \n\n>\tIn order to encourage stakers to diversify their setups, penalties are higher for correlated failures.
