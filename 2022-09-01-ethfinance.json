Well timed for financial reasons as well as public acceptance.\n\n\\- If we merged today, total daily issuance would be roughly equivalent to daily block-space demand (both seem to equate to around $2.6m, looking at the 7 day figures on [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money) and cryptofees.info). So the starting point post-merge is from a flat position, i.e. no structural sell pressure. But then you factor in some more positives such as the burn, which looks set to burn the majority of annual issuance anyway even at today's Gwei prices, and that validators cannot withdraw until the Shanghai fork, and until then can only sell tips received. If we call tips like 1/3rd or something\\*, then at best only 1/3rd of daily issuance can be sold by validators into daily block-space demand at triple the 'available' issuance for sale. So ETH price keeps going up organically unless existing ETH holders get spooked by macro and dump ETH in general. Of course, on top of this, if any institutions feel that Eth is sufficiently derisked after a successful merge, some may start buying, causing even more buying pressure, though I personally don't see that happening until withdrawals are operational.\n\n\\- More countries might ban BTC mining. The question is no longer whether a miner uses renewable sources or not, it's whether it's in a country's best interest to ban BTC mining to protect energy security.\n\n\\- Any smart new money entering the blockchain ecosystem is not going to pick the one with massive energy overhead.\n\n\\- As for existing money, we probably see more BTC rotating into ETH. BTC has $18 million in issuance per day, yet only $215k in daily blockspace demand per day.

Not sure how up to date this figure is tbh. If tips are actually a lot lower then there's even less issuance to feed into blockspace demand.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Excellent points.</p>\n\n<p>- Eth moving to PoS  when power prices are absolutely sending could not have come at a better time. Well timed for financial reasons as well as public acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>- If we merged today, total daily issuance would be roughly equivalent to daily block-space demand (both seem to equate to around $2.6m, looking at the 7 day figures on <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money\">ultrasound.money</a> and cryptofees.info). So the starting point post-merge is from a flat position, i.e. no structural sell pressure. But then you factor in some more positives such as the burn, which looks set to burn the majority of annual issuance anyway even at today&#39;s Gwei prices, and that validators cannot withdraw until the Shanghai fork, and until then can only sell tips received. If we call tips like 1/3rd or something*, then at best only 1/3rd of daily issuance can be sold by validators into daily block-space demand at triple the &#39;available&#39; issuance for sale. So ETH price keeps going up organically unless existing ETH holders get spooked by macro and dump ETH in general. Of course, on top of this, if any institutions feel that Eth is sufficiently derisked after a successful merge, some may start buying, causing even more buying pressure, though I personally don&#39;t see that happening until withdrawals are operational.</p>\n\n<p>- More countries might ban BTC mining. The question is no longer whether a miner uses renewable sources or not, it&#39;s whether it&#39;s in a country&#39;s best interest to ban BTC mining to protect energy security.</p>\n\n<p>- Any smart new money entering the blockchain ecosystem is not going to pick the one with massive energy overhead.</p>\n\n<p>- As for existing money, we probably see more BTC rotating into ETH. BTC has $18 million in issuance per day, yet only $215k in daily blockspace demand per day. If liquidity keeps drying up... there is no cushion to absorb this structural sell pressure.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>*: <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">https://ultrasound.money/</a> estimates tips at roughly 37.5% of a validator&#39;s yearly income.

So, if you want to read about what happens after \"shitting the desk\", Here is a little recap:\n\nI was bored with my former job and needed something new. What is better than to learn a new programming language and tools? Last autumn I joined the Consensys bootcamp with 2 friends to learn some of the basics of Web3. It was quite a good introduction as it provided a certain pace and pressure to learn. We finished our first full DApp and published it on a testnet. It was a great experience.\n\nAfter the bootcamp I was a bit aimless for 2 months, read a lot and rather worked on running validators for testnets and hardened my own mainnet validator. \n\nIn March we, a friend and I, applied for ETHAmsterdam and Devconnect to get even deeper into the space. The Hackathons and conferences were great and it was so encouraging to see that most people in the community are just awesome to talk to and so much fun to hang out with. At the ETHAmsterdam hackathon we worked on an event offsetter for on-carbon retirements. We barely managed to get something submitted but we had a lot of fun. The Judges at the Hackathon asked us if we would want to continue working on this as they would be very interested in using this for their own conference which is Devcon VI in Bogota.\n\nIn the last few months we have first been working on deploying a [minimal flight offsetter](https://flight.discarbon.earth/) for crypto natives to be able to transparently and verifiably offset their flight emission at actual market prices. In Parallel we started working on the project to make it possible for every participant of Devcon VI to be able to calculate and participate in offsetting their part of the carbon footprint of Devcon VI. It is not ready yet and not finally approved by all stakeholders, but we are working on getting there. If you are interested you can check the [Devcon forum](https://forum.devcon.org/t/lets-make-devcon6-carbon-neutral-a-step-towards-implementing-dip-1-dip-12/400/6).\n\nMy personal goal leaving a traditional job was to see if I could make something in the Web3 space. I definitely did not want to jump into a Web3 company right away but first wanted to see what the space is like and how one can contribute. So from this point of view it is going great. Being involved in the largest Ethereum conference is just awesome. The disadvantage is that it is unpaid at the moment. We applied for a small grant which got through, but this only covers for about a quarter of our time. So my bank account is draining slowly but steadily.\n\nSo, in the next few weeks and months we will see what the response of the involved parties is and decide if we see a future in our approach in the space to actually be able to earn a minimal income on the projects we do, or if we will have to go back in a more traditional software developer role in a Web3 company.\n\nTLDR: Left traditional software dev Job exactly 1 year ago. Set sail towards the Web3 space. You are all awesome.

I didn&#39;t actually believe an early recession was on the cards.</p>\n\n<p>However, something very unusual happened last Friday. First time in market history. </p>\n\n<p>You might recall back in July I discussed how the market has never gone from fully negative breadth to fully positive breadth (it was when SPY returned above the 50-Day off the low in one fell swoop) off of a low without solidifying that as the low. Going back 90 years, the low was in.</p>\n\n<p>Then, last Friday the advance decline line moving average for the entire market (the composite) closed negative -- deeply negative -- for August. The market has never returned to a bull phase when the NYAD was down YTD 10% in August. For 90 years.</p>\n\n<p>We now have two competing indicators, neither has ever been wrong since the birth of the modern stock market. One says guaranteed bull. One says guaranteed bear. It&#39;s history we&#39;re living through.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-06 12:40:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"incs0r5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x2yrhi","parent_id":"t1_inc8900","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-06 12:53:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"inctz7e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x2yrhi","parent_id":"t1_incs0r5","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"NYAD is a younger indicator from the 70s bear, that's been backtested to the Great Depression.

You will find this relationship, this equilibrium, at the root of all existence in the universe; as it is a well known fact that giving has always been, is, and will always be more profitable than getting.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-01 11:38:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"imozli9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x2yrhi","parent_id":"t3_x2yrhi","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/SuddenMind","body":"Yesterday, I heard the most bullish 2.5 hour podcast on the Merge with Hal Press and Nikhil Shamapant (aka SquishChaos): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHyix8P48uU \n\nIt's all Merge, for all 2.5 hours.
