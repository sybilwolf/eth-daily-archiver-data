You might be thinking I'm about to tell you you don't have enough ETH because of the impending PE improvement from the issuance reduction and increase to real yield. I don't have much to add outside of Hal Press's thesis on that point. If you want something unique from me on that topic I'll point you to some things I've written on [exchange reserves](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/woqr6p/daily_general_discussion_august_15_2022/ikfyfbf/) which provides something of a timeline. No, what I'm actually here to tell you is that once *withdrawals* are enabled there's a less appreciated form of increased ETH yield that becomes more possible that might dominate your ETH yield even as a staker.\n\nLet's break this down. Normally in crypto I say there are five kinds of yield:\n\n1) Lending revenue from money markets.\n\n2) Trading revenue from market making.\n\n3) Bridge revenue from, well, bridging.\n\n4) Governance revenue, sometimes doubling as insurance.\n\n5) Staking.\n\nIf you think about these sources of revenue at least 1-3 and sometimes 4 are paying you for taking on some kind of risk and for the use of your money. Staking though is a bit different in that the risk is lower but you're actually getting paid for performing a computation service. It's not *just* your money making money or getting paid for absorbing risk; you have some extra work to do. In order to ensure you perform that service honestly and completely you have to put capital down as a bond. Because you have to put capital down as a bond you have to be compensated not only for the IT department you're running but also for the time cost of money. I think it's fair to say the time cost of money dominates the actual cost of the system. As a thought exercise, if people could spin up validators and earn ETH without having to bond capital somehow I think we'd see a lot more validators and the system would devolve into something like proof of work as people dilute the rewards down to the cost of running a validator.\n\nThis pattern is applicable for other services too. For example, Golem and Filecoin are compute layer sharing economy tools with their own tokens that are used as a bond for their network. Another good example is data availability layer for L2's. Just like ETH, the majority of the system cost actually goes to paying for the time cost of money. But, if all you actually need is bonded capital and you already have bonded capital with a maximum leak rate, why can't you bond that capital for multiple tasks?\n\nHow would this work? Well, just like with Rocketpool you bond your ETH by first depositing it to a contract. Any rewards and your bonded ETH are locked in the contract in accordance to its rules and can't be withdrawn while pledged to some integration. The contract keeps track of what portion of your ETH been bonded to various integrations and the worst case loss of that bond for each of those integrations such that you can never lose more than what has been bonded at once. Then we add a bunch of integrations to this contract such as running an ETH validator, data availability layer, compute services, insurance, etc.\n\nLet's take an example of how this might affect APR.\n\n1) You take your 32 ETH and you stake it. You're making staking APR immediately at 5%. The maximum you can lose before a keeper could respond is the slashing rate. I don't know how much that is for a single event but I think it's less than 1 ETH. If you ever get to less than 1 ETH of your own a keeper will force a validator withdrawal using a fancy multi-sig. You can potentially rebond the other 31 ETH.\n\n2) You rebond the ETH in a compute sharing system. This system a max failure penalty rate kind of like an inactivity leak in staking. Let's say that's another 1 ETH worst case loss. You could now potentially rebond 30 ETH again. Fulfilling this job brings in another 1% APR on the staked ETH.\n\n3) You want to go further so you rebond your ETH in an insurance system. Unlike the compute share system you can lose all of this bond atomically so there's a maximum that you can rebond for this purpose equal to your 30 ETH but for each ETH bonded this way it can't be bonded again. So you put 30 ETH to work. Let's say this insurance system works like Nexus Mutual which allows you to insure up to 10 protocols with the same capital. You get 0.5% APR from each protocol and it goes swimmingly and brings you another 5% APR on 30 ETH.\n\nIn total you are making close to 11% APR on your staked ETH. That's fantastically incredible and these are just the tip of the iceberg of potential integrations. The reuse of your capital is only gated by the integrations this contract can put together and the maximum risk of each integration. This restaking concept is the power behind [EigenLayer](https://www.layrlabs.com/) but I think it's far more general than they have in mind. There's also nothing saying it *has to* use ETH as the bonded collateral but I feel solving the time cost of money using ETH staking will be the most popular use case. For every other use case, these systems can offer cheaper services by removing or at least socializing the time cost of money.\n\nJust to summarize my argument here:\n\n1) There is an entire class of revenue in crypto that come from providing services that require bonded capital. ETH staking is just the most famous example.\n\n2) The time cost of money dominates the actual cost of these systems.\n\n3) A system that removes the time cost of money would therefore be far more capital efficient and will outcompete its competitors.\n\n4) One way of accomplishing this is to allow for rebonding. Capital can be bonded to multiple purposes so long as you can't lose more than you bond before the system can respond and that the capital does not need to be actively deployed to more than 1 place at a time.\n\n5) This will dominate over systems that require their own token as the bond. This makes an entire class of token design **obsolete** while further enshrining the value of ETH since ETH staking can be used to solve the base time cost of money.\n\n6) This drives up the effective yield of ETH for those who know what they are doing which will bring more money to this space.\n\n7) You probably don't have enough ETH.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Unlike CT and the rest of reddit I think most of us around here are familiar with the fact that staking yield is going to go up with the merge.
