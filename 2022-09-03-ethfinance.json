It's so important to keep in mind that this is one view of the network and what we see here is an indication of the whole network, but the visualizer is just as likely to have hiccups as the actual chain- so first thing: don't assume this is accurate.\n\nWhen TTD is met around September 14 or 15 (look at https://bordel.wtf and scroll down for their poap), execution clients (geth, besu, erigon, nethermind) will stop producing blocks on the PoW network, instead, they'll turn their attention to the consensus client(teku, nimbus, lighthouse, lodestar, prysm) that they've been paired with, usually on the same machine . It's useful to remember that node operators will always need to run both clients: a consensus client and an execution client.\n\nNow block proposing is in the hands of the consensus client while the execution client is still processing transactions. Ethereum will have entered Proof of Stake.\n\nWe'll be watching [the visualizer](https://beaconcha.in/charts/slotviz) for two major things: \n\n**first:** Are lots of blocks with transactions being proposed? This is an indication of whether everyone has updated their client or whether we're in a fragmented network. If there are lots of missed proposals it could mean there's a fork or nodes have fallen off the network for whatever reason. A fork is an undesired annoyance, but the chain can re-organize itself to sort them out. I fully expect to see about six missed blocks in the first few epochs (an epoch is 32 block proposal opportunities, called \"slots\"). This will cause some nervousness, but it's fully expected and is part of the design philosophy of the beacon chain: we expect minor failures but overall success. We'll also be monitoring to make sure that the proposed blocks include transactions, as empty blocks are possible.\n\n**second:** Every 32 slots (we call them \"slots\" because we don't assume that they're filled with blocks, even though we hope they are,\n the network keeps advancing regardless) we're going to get a metric called \"participation\", it's essentially a calculation of how many validators participated in validating the blocks that were proposed. Ideally, we want every validator sending in their votes to say, \"yep! This looks good!\" We're going to watch for participation in two phases: the first phase is \"justification\", it happens 1 epoch (6.4 minutes, or 32 slots x 12 seconds) after we reach TTD. If everything is going well and we have greater than 66% participation then the first epoch (and all of the blocks in it) after TTD will have a tentative stamp of approval from the chain, this is justification. \n\nThe second phase is waiting ANOTHER 6.4 minutes for the second epoch past TTD, and again looking for participation above 66%. If we achieve that, then the first epoch (the one that was previously justified) will become finalized. Finalization is the ultimate goal of this whole process, it means that blocks created up to this point are completely unchangeable.\n\nHere's what to look for: participation **will** drop at the point of the merge (TTD). To be perfectly honest, I hope it drops a fair bit. If our network is controlled by one or two entities who have plenty of people on staff it might go flawlessly, but that's not a decentralized network (and it's pretty catastrophic if those people on staff screw up). If we're a ragtag gang of home stakers, some of us won't update properly, or have installed both clients, or will have failed to complete the merge readiness checklist. In short, I EXPECT some nodes and validators to have technical difficulty (please don't let this be you \ud83d\ude2c). This network doesn't need professional operators, it needs lots of diverse people running validators. I expect to see participation in the range of 80% (+/- 10%) at the point of the merge. If a large entity (like an exchange or large pool) fails, participation could drop very low. This is inconvenient, but fine- it will take a few hours for any of these operators to get back online and begin participating again, with some minor network penalties and some embarrassment (no one will be slashed, that's only if you run your keys in two places and generally isn't part of this event). When 66% of validators get their nodes up and running participation will increase, leading to justification and then finalization. I do not expect to see delayed finalization as a result of the merge, but it's totally okay if it does happen- the network is self-healing: missing validators will leak funds quickly as the network tries to prune them, meanwhile, operators will be scrambling to get online so they don't leak. This is where I point out that normal leakage is tiny, but if we have less than 66% participation, leakage is severe.\n\nSo yeah, that's what I'll be looking for: full blocks being proposed and greater than 66% participation. There's also a chance that one of the clients fails, that's probably another paragraph, but it's relatively unlikely, and given our moderate client diversity it will essentially mean that the network will hobble for a few hours until the affected teams issue an update and it gets applied.\n\nPSA: Node operators must be fully updated by September 6 to avoid forking and be merge ready!\n\ntl;dr: we need blocks and participation above 66%. This is likely to happen quickly, but even if it's slow it will still work out in a few hours. The design of the beacon chain means success is highly likely even if it's not instant.\n\nI'll be on a Livestream with a bunch of folks trying to process this event, I hope you'll join us.

The conclusion doesn&#39;t follow and if we have a more successful merge (greater than 90%) some people may start questioning decentralization based on that. Just skip that comment in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Make emphasis instead on the fact that the network is designed to operate under imperfect conditions and drops in participation are not a problem during or even after the merge. Then you can use that to to talk about finality and the mechanisms the network has to fix the network if it drops under 66%.</p>\n\n<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-03 07:16:23","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-09-03 07:27:46","id":"imxfzbg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x4m18u","parent_id":"t1_imwwx36","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"Thank you!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-03 07:17:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"imxg3zx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x4m18u","parent_id":"t1_imxfzbg","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pa7x1","body":"No problem phiz!!

So yeah, for others reading: the MEV boost software itself literally just acts as a middleware between relays and your consensus client - using the builder API spec - deciding what to forward and where.
