It'll be more gradual than that. You won't see your big upswings or downturns unless big things happen, the merge isn't such a thing. What -IS- such a thing is when they allow people who are currently staking to withdraw their rewards and pull out portions of their staked Eth.\n\nThey're saying early 2023 which means Christmas next year\n\nI expect a pump to 10-15-20k before they pull the carpet out and allow rewards to be reaped, and unlock the staked coins. Scarcity will be the reason for the price swing; Gemini, Binance, Coinbase, all these exchanges offer a service where anyone can stake and some do it because they see the FDIC crap and think they're insured. Read those agreements, they have more holes than Sonny did at the toll.  Long term, ie 3 years from now, Eth will be on top and worth 20 or better.
