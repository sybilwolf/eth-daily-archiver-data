My metamask got compromised a few days ago. I made a simple mistake, I signed a transaction from my account on a link to an official looking mint for an NFT that I had seen before. Of course there were red flags, I was mentioned in a tweet, and clicked on the giveaway, but still it gets worse, I didn\u2019t read the signature page, I signed one page, then it asked for two more, at that point, I backed out and canceled the transaction, but it was too late. Within a few minutes all of my NFTs in my account were gone. This was not my main stash of eth, just my side account where I kept NFTs and airdrops and such. But I had about 50 ENS, including a few worth over 1 eth. I was notified on twitter by someone who noticed all of my ENS being transferred out of my account. I was shocked, and devastated. Soon after, the scam artists came for more.  I was getting all sorts of messages from people saying they had their account stolen as well. All were scams too of course but it just goes to show how ruthless they can be\u2026.Scamming those that just got scammed. Fortunately I was able to track down a few people who had bought my domains from the scam account after they were transferred. I managed to buy back two of mine for what they had paid. But I\u2019m left numb. Please, please learn from my mistakes. If you\u2019re active on Twitter or social media be very skeptical of any tweet or post you\u2019re tagged in. And please read every single thing you\u2019re connecting to before signing. I was too haphazard and it cost me. Most of my domains are still sitting in the transferred account. It\u2019s so frustrating, some of my domains were very symbolic to me and held special meaning. The two I managed to buy back are now in my new account and I\u2019ll never connect to anything from that account unless it\u2019s to sell. I feel so foolish. I\u2019ve been in crypto for almost as long as I\u2019ve had this reddit account, and I\u2019ve been a member of /r/ethfinance since day 1. All it takes is one quick mistake, one misclick, one thing you\u2019re too busy to look at closely. You can lose it all if you\u2019re not careful. Stay safe","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve been reluctant to post this, but it\u2019s important so here goes. My metamask got compromised a few days ago. I made a simple mistake, I signed a transaction from my account on a link to an official looking mint for an NFT that I had seen before. Of course there were red flags, I was mentioned in a tweet, and clicked on the giveaway, but still it gets worse, I didn\u2019t read the signature page, I signed one page, then it asked for two more, at that point, I backed out and canceled the transaction, but it was too late. Within a few minutes all of my NFTs in my account were gone. This was not my main stash of eth, just my side account where I kept NFTs and airdrops and such. But I had about 50 ENS, including a few worth over 1 eth. I was notified on twitter by someone who noticed all of my ENS being transferred out of my account. I was shocked, and devastated. Soon after, the scam artists came for more.  I was getting all sorts of messages from people saying they had their account stolen as well. All were scams too of course but it just goes to show how ruthless they can be\u2026.Scamming those that just got scammed. Fortunately I was able to track down a few people who had bought my domains from the scam account after they were transferred. I managed to buy back two of mine for what they had paid. But I\u2019m left numb. Please, please learn from my mistakes. If you\u2019re active on Twitter or social media be very skeptical of any tweet or post you\u2019re tagged in. And please read every single thing you\u2019re connecting to before signing. I was too haphazard and it cost me. Most of my domains are still sitting in the transferred account. It\u2019s so frustrating, some of my domains were very symbolic to me and held special meaning. The two I managed to buy back are now in my new account and I\u2019ll never connect to anything from that account unless it\u2019s to sell. I feel so foolish. I\u2019ve been in crypto for almost as long as I\u2019ve had this reddit account, and I\u2019ve been a member of <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">/r/ethfinance</a> since day 1. All it takes is one quick mistake, one misclick, one thing you\u2019re too busy to look at closely. You can lose it all if you\u2019re not careful.

On-site bitcoin mining can be especially impactful, because 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air\n\nPlus many landfills apparently don't even flare the gas.
