For example: one at home, one at work/at a friend, one at your parents. You can even put the photo of one in your phone and distribute only 2 sheets.\n\nThe day you need your seed, you need to gather only 2 sheets. Any combination of 2 sheets contains the whole seed.\n\nTo obfuscate the process, you can even write random words in the 8 blank spaces of each sheet.

Post-withdrawals, LSD ETH tokens are effectively ETH bills, a debt product that is:\n\n-\tshort maturity (set by withdrawal queue)\n-\trisk-free (for the protocol, not in USD denomination)\n-\tzero-coupon (interest is paid at redemption)\n-\ttraded openly (not necessarily at par)\n\nIf every 32 ETH that are staked are represented by an IOU ERC-20 balance, then so long as there is liquidity to satisfy transaction throughout, the net effect on supply is minimal, and we see little price impact.  Right now, in the bear, this is about 0.5% of float, but let\u2019s say that could be 5% in a euphoric mania. \n\nIf the balance of staked ETH is more toward solo validators, or we get way up into the high 90% range of total staked ETH supply in all forms, then I think we would have a good catalyst for the next bull for ETH to flip BTC.  We need so much ETH staked that there is not enough liquidity sloshing around to satisfy an DeFi/NFT-summer style event. \n\nEIP-1559 will be a long term tailwind for price, but I think its main intention, to improve the UX in the fee market, is the bigger boon right now.  Issuance is going to decrease by ~90%, and net issuance will even be deflationary sometimes, but it is still a fraction of daily trading volumes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a mechanical step change in price because of this effect, but it is great for sentiment/momentum going into the next bull.  I\u2019ve debated this point back and forth a few times in the last year so it will be interesting to see who is right on the timeframe. \n\nInterested to hear what people think about supply impacts on price as they relate to LSD use. Haven\u2019t seen this topic discussed much.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If there is a flood of ETH that pours into validators post-merge (or post-withdrawals), it\u2019ll be interesting to see the proportion that goes into solo validators vs. LSDs.</p>\n\n<p>My hunch, which is an admittedly lukewarm take, is the LSDs will win the lion\u2019s share, meaning that ETH supply will effectively be unencumbered by high lockup. Post-withdrawals, LSD ETH tokens are effectively ETH bills, a debt product that is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  short maturity (set by withdrawal queue)</li>\n<li>  risk-free (for the protocol, not in USD denomination)</li>\n<li>  zero-coupon (interest is paid at redemption)</li>\n<li>  traded openly (not necessarily at par)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If every 32 ETH that are staked are represented by an IOU ERC-20 balance, then so long as there is liquidity to satisfy transaction throughout, the net effect on supply is minimal, and we see little price impact.  Right now, in the bear, this is about 0.5% of float, but let\u2019s say that could be 5% in a euphoric mania. </p>\n\n<p>If the balance of staked ETH is more toward solo validators, or we get way up into the high 90% range of total staked ETH supply in all forms, then I think we would have a good catalyst for the next bull for ETH to flip BTC.  We need so much ETH staked that there is not enough liquidity sloshing around to satisfy an DeFi/NFT-summer style event. </p>\n\n<p>EIP-1559 will be a long term tailwind for price, but I think its main intention, to improve the UX in the fee market, is the bigger boon right now.  Issuance is going to decrease by ~90%, and net issuance will even be deflationary sometimes, but it is still a fraction of daily trading volumes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a mechanical step change in price because of this effect, but it is great for sentiment/momentum going into the next bull.
