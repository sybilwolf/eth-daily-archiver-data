Again, there would be a mad scramble to patch the bug, but we'd also be facing a huge debate about whether to roll back the chain to weed out the effects of the exploit. As we know from the DAO hack, this is exceedingly messy. Note, however, that if such a bug were discovered, the attacker would almost certainly use it immediately after the Merge. Ethereum is already plenty huge, and waiting longer would not substantially increase the benefits of using the bug, while hugely risking that someone else would find and use it, or that it would get patched. So this would likely happen almost immediately post-Merge.\n\nSo anyway, this is what we're up against in the coming days.

This is when the actual criminals (or clandestine governmental organizations) come into the picture. They found a major bug, and decided not to report it at all. They waited until after the Merge, and are actively intending to exploit it for their own profit or benefit. Needless to say, this would be the worst scenario, because it would represent an actual base protocol flaw that made it through all the checks and balances, and ended up harming actual users. Again, there would be a mad scramble to patch the bug, but we&#39;d also be facing a huge debate about whether to roll back the chain to weed out the effects of the exploit. As we know from the DAO hack, this is exceedingly messy. Note, however, that if such a bug were discovered, the attacker would almost certainly use it immediately after the Merge. Ethereum is already plenty huge, and waiting longer would not substantially increase the benefits of using the bug, while hugely risking that someone else would find and use it, or that it would get patched. So this would likely happen almost immediately post-Merge.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So anyway, this is what we&#39;re up against in the coming days. If we can make it through the next 2-3 weeks with no issues, I would personally feel very confident that no such bugs exist. </p>\n\n<p>But honestly, this is it. We&#39;re entering the butt-clenching part of the Merge <strong>now</strong>, not next Thursday.

And not the entire set. </p>\n\n<p>I dont see the innovation. Tell me whats better and how it doesnt actually divide security. It just looks like the same old stuff with slightly different vocabulary. </p>\n\n<p>also provides strong guarantees? How strong?
