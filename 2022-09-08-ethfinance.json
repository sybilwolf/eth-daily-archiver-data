Considering the uptick in daily activity here recently, it might get buried; but hopefully for those few that do take the time to stop and read it, it'll also give you something to reflect on today too.\n\nI've been an avid lurker in this sub for a few years now. I have read every daily (not necessarily on the day its posted, but I always catch up). During the last bull, I could only read the comments that had more than ~10 updoots, due to the long-tail below that. And so much was happening in the space, the major news floated above that baseline.\n\nI had to take a bit of a leave of absense for 2.5 months. In that time, Ethereum moved on. A lot happened. And when I came back, I realised - as a active participant in the background of this space (if you have seen me before, it'll have been adding precisely zero value in some Discord channels) - I had to catch up on what had changed while I hadn't been looking. I started the first week of August, and since then, I have read *101* daily threads _in their entirety_ (I threw out the 10-doot lower bound, due to the generally-lower volumes), and finally caught up last night. I had really tried to finish before Bellatrix happened, but updating my own node in prepation took out those last few hours I would have needed.\n\nIt takes me about an hour to read an 850 comment daily thread. So, around having a full-time job, house renovations, and sleeping, for the last month, I have used up all my spare time catching up (and having more dailies appearing as I went!). When you read so much material so consecutively, you really start to notice trends.\n\nFirstly, /u/jtnichol - you're not the only one who has been keeping track of thousand-comment-days. Here's the ones since May 29th, when my catch-up started:\n\n- 31st May 2022\n- 8th June 2022\n- 10th June 2022\n- 11th June 2022\n- 12th June 2022\n- 13th June 2022 (2990 comments!)\n- 14th June 2022\n- 15th June 2022\n- 16th June 2022\n- 17th June 2022\n- 18th June 2022\n- 19th June 2022\n- ...\n- 18th July 2022\n- ...\n- 10th August 2022\n- 11th August 2022\n- 12th August 2022\n- ...\n- 6th September 2022\n- 7th September 2022\n\nLook at that drop off! We're definitely deep in the bear right now, so if you're still here (even lurking), know how unique you are in the world. We talk about the Merge not being priced in, but how can it be? Retail has long left, those trying to flip a quick buck have gone elsewhere, and what's left is the community. The core. The people who are the true believers, the world shapers, the ethos definers. Those names you see posting every day while you lurk? The fact you know even their names make you special to this community too.\n\nTo remind everyone how quickly this world changes, let me quickly walk you through some of the events that I've read about first-hand in the last four weeks:\n\n- Hodlrcon (seriously, 3 months ago!)\n- The first discussions about whether Celsuis was still solvent or not. People downplaying the Twitter rumours as there wasn't any evidence of a collapse yet.\n- The slow ripple of discovery of the Bancor implosion\n- A pushback on the difficulty bomb to give us more time to prepare for The Merge with Grey Glacier\n- The Nitter bot. Seriously, it wasn't there in the first posts I was catching up on.\n- All the Tornado Cash stuff, obviously\n- Ropsten, Sepolia and Goerli (yea, seriously. I missed all three of the testnet POAPs. I won't be missing the real deal though!)\n- /u/Moschus11 went from barely getting 3 upvotes for their infinite-scroll countdown tracker, to getting 115 yesterday (not that's why they're doing it - but it shows the change in sentiment and excitement to where we were back then)\n- Talking of redemptions, /u/ab111292's complete redemption in the eyes of our community from regularly being close to negative votes, to being /u/Kbrot's equal and opposite\n- Finding out u/REALJohnBMacLemore is really a secret NSA AI project. Also, Caches being first teased as an idea (and Rocket - man, I'm so sorry. You had me in tears more than once at your ordeal. I hope you're doing ok - a man who likes Jammy Dodgers as much as you, is A-OK in my books)\n\nI'm not diving into the more recent stuff (Saylor standing down, Bellatrix fork, etc), because you'll all have that in mind anyways. But just remember how much can change in 3 months in this space. The plummet to the low in price was three months ago now, next week we're at the Merge. In 3 months, _at our most optimistic_, we might even only be 3 months from Shanghai and withdrawals forever de-risking staking.\n\nBut this isn't just something that happens \"around you\". Within all those posts, I found out that:\n\n- [I was eligble for a refund from Gro on the GRT I had on Argent (which I wouldn't have known about without catching up on the posts, as I never received the email)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ve558e/daily_general_discussion_june_17_2022/icq9dwf/)\n- /u/superphiz [made me a signatory on the phizfans.eth Gnosis multi-sig](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/vfnoiz/daily_general_discussion_june_19_2022/icynizu/) because I once sent him a nice message on Discord, and got a POAP in return\n- [I wasn't the only one in here that was affected by Invictus' amateur-hour YOLO approach to stablecoin holdings in their crypto index fund products](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/vlnig6/daily_general_discussion_june_27_2022/idye89k/)\n\nAnd just a few more things you should know:\n\n- /u/ScribbleButter continues to DCA every Tuesday\n- /u/ZeroTricks is still kind enough to tell us what has happened historically every day (but doesn't seem to spark much conversation, which I find odd)\n- If you're not as crazy as me and don't want to read every comment, _every day_ - /u/Tricky_Troll really is your friendly neighbourhood daily doot dealer\n- There's some really cool things happening in the backrooms of Discord, if you know where to look. For one, the partnerships happening around balancing out ETH's historic/future emissions is mad exciting.\n\nThere isn't really a point to this stupid long message. It's just me noting I have finished my mission, and sharing some of the thoughts that came up while I did it. There's many people in this space, all doing their own thing to make it a tiny bit better. Not even 48 hours ago, /u/interweaver hosted a relatively-inpromptu voice chat in the EVM discord to watch Bellatrix happen. We sat together to watch a streamed text log scroll, until it declared the formal start of ETH's mainnet PoS migration. They saw a gap and took the initiative to plug it. Be more like /u/interweaver when the opportunity arises - it didn't require any crazy DeFi knowledge, it didn't even require having a validator (another operator stepped up to share their screen after removing the doxxing parts). It just took someone to be brave and be the change they wanted to see.\n\nWhen I signed off my first message in this subreddit on this new account, I suggested I was working on something in the background. With my absense, that hasn't progressed at all - but now that I've caught up with Ethereum moving on without me, it's time for me to go back to filling the gap I've seen for the small benefit of all of you.\n\nOnwards, upwards, and to the right! LFG.\n\nP.S. I'm very aware that noone I've tagged here will get a ping to this post. I wouldn't have directly tagged them if it would have.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>GM Mergenaries.</p>\n\n<p>This is a long self-reflective post. Considering the uptick in daily activity here recently, it might get buried; but hopefully for those few that do take the time to stop and read it, it&#39;ll also give you something to reflect on today too.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been an avid lurker in this sub for a few years now. I have read every daily (not necessarily on the day its posted, but I always catch up). During the last bull, I could only read the comments that had more than ~10 updoots, due to the long-tail below that. And so much was happening in the space, the major news floated above that baseline.</p>\n\n<p>I had to take a bit of a leave of absense for 2.5 months. In that time, Ethereum moved on. A lot happened. And when I came back, I realised - as a active participant in the background of this space (if you have seen me before, it&#39;ll have been adding precisely zero value in some Discord channels) - I had to catch up on what had changed while I hadn&#39;t been looking. I started the first week of August, and since then, I have read <em>101</em> daily threads <em>in their entirety</em> (I threw out the 10-doot lower bound, due to the generally-lower volumes), and finally caught up last night. I had really tried to finish before Bellatrix happened, but updating my own node in prepation took out those last few hours I would have needed.</p>\n\n<p>It takes me about an hour to read an 850 comment daily thread. So, around having a full-time job, house renovations, and sleeping, for the last month, I have used up all my spare time catching up (and having more dailies appearing as I went!). When you read so much material so consecutively, you really start to notice trends.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, <a href=\"/u/jtnichol\">/u/jtnichol</a> - you&#39;re not the only one who has been keeping track of thousand-comment-days. Here&#39;s the ones since May 29th, when my catch-up started:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>31st May 2022</li>\n<li>8th June 2022</li>\n<li>10th June 2022</li>\n<li>11th June 2022</li>\n<li>12th June 2022</li>\n<li>13th June 2022 (2990 comments!)</li>\n<li>14th June 2022</li>\n<li>15th June 2022</li>\n<li>16th June 2022</li>\n<li>17th June 2022</li>\n<li>18th June 2022</li>\n<li>19th June 2022</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>18th July 2022</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>10th August 2022</li>\n<li>11th August 2022</li>\n<li>12th August 2022</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>6th September 2022</li>\n<li>7th September 2022</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Look at that drop off! We&#39;re definitely deep in the bear right now, so if you&#39;re still here (even lurking), know how unique you are in the world. We talk about the Merge not being priced in, but how can it be? Retail has long left, those trying to flip a quick buck have gone elsewhere, and what&#39;s left is the community. The core. The people who are the true believers, the world shapers, the ethos definers. Those names you see posting every day while you lurk? The fact you know even their names make you special to this community too.</p>\n\n<p>To remind everyone how quickly this world changes, let me quickly walk you through some of the events that I&#39;ve read about first-hand in the last four weeks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hodlrcon (seriously, 3 months ago!)</li>\n<li>The first discussions about whether Celsuis was still solvent or not. People downplaying the Twitter rumours as there wasn&#39;t any evidence of a collapse yet.</li>\n<li>The slow ripple of discovery of the Bancor implosion</li>\n<li>A pushback on the difficulty bomb to give us more time to prepare for The Merge with Grey Glacier</li>\n<li>The Nitter bot. Seriously, it wasn&#39;t there in the first posts I was catching up on.</li>\n<li>All the Tornado Cash stuff, obviously</li>\n<li>Ropsten, Sepolia and Goerli (yea, seriously. I missed all three of the testnet POAPs. I won&#39;t be missing the real deal though!)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/u/Moschus11\">/u/Moschus11</a> went from barely getting 3 upvotes for their infinite-scroll countdown tracker, to getting 115 yesterday (not that&#39;s why they&#39;re doing it - but it shows the change in sentiment and excitement to where we were back then)</li>\n<li>Talking of redemptions, <a href=\"/u/ab111292\">/u/ab111292</a>&#39;s complete redemption in the eyes of our community from regularly being close to negative votes, to being <a href=\"/u/Kbrot\">/u/Kbrot</a>&#39;s equal and opposite</li>\n<li>Finding out <a href=\"/u/REALJohnBMacLemore\">u/REALJohnBMacLemore</a> is really a secret NSA AI project. Also, Caches being first teased as an idea (and Rocket - man, I&#39;m so sorry. You had me in tears more than once at your ordeal. I hope you&#39;re doing ok - a man who likes Jammy Dodgers as much as you, is A-OK in my books)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not diving into the more recent stuff (Saylor standing down, Bellatrix fork, etc), because you&#39;ll all have that in mind anyways. But just remember how much can change in 3 months in this space. The plummet to the low in price was three months ago now, next week we&#39;re at the Merge. In 3 months, <em>at our most optimistic</em>, we might even only be 3 months from Shanghai and withdrawals forever de-risking staking.</p>\n\n<p>But this isn&#39;t just something that happens &quot;around you&quot;.

Maybe that has changed. I think MEV has been a topic I really want to understand and can understand. Not on a technical level to become a searcher, being active in the flashbots discord etc., but on a meta level, because I think this topic will be hot for the years\u00a0to come, it's a great mix of tech and design.\u00a0  \n\n\nWhat is MEV? MEV started as \"miner extractable value\" and is nowadays more referred to as \"max extractable value\". It is the value a (originally) miner could extract by using the powers given to them by the protocol. Which powers? Deciding which transactions go into a certain block (most of the time: the next block) and more importantly in which position of the block. Since all transactions hit the public mempool they are public information and visible to all network participants. This allows highly skilled people to react to these transactions and make money by including transactions that extract the value offered by the first transactions. This could be arbitrage (e.g. price differences in different DEX pools, on Uniswap and Sushi), liquidations (e.g. being the first to liquidate a position by being the first in the block after price oracles have been updated), but also the famous frontrunning and sandwich attacks (e.g. seeing a large transaction that would increase the price of an asset because of high slippage and getting your own transaction in before, so basically buying low, holding/ selling higher). These are just some examples of MEV, there is much more to extract, MEV can be very complex (def cross chain, most likely cross block) and there is no clear MEV definition, so maybe other strategies are considered MEV by some, but not by all.\u00a0  \n\n\nSo what have I learned,\u00a0on a very high level?  \n\\- There will always be MEV. Or in other words: we can't eliminate MEV completely (but we can probably eliminate some forms of MEV).  \n\\- MEV is not a blockchain/ crypto thing, it's just named differently in other industries.\u00a0  \n\\- There is no MEV without a transaction. This one is very important I think.\u00a0  \n\n\nAfter listening to a lot of podcasts and reading a lot, understanding PGA (priority gas auctions), flash bots, the different roles connected to MEV (searchers, miners), PBS and MEV boost, which introduces new roles (builders, relays) I think I have a good feeling for what's going on. Disclaimer: I am still not a dev, it's very likely there are still some mistakes in the following, but that's part of the goal of this post: I always love writing down stuff to structure my thoughts and receive feedback. So let's see where we are at right now:With the move from PoW to PoS the MEV game will slightly change. There are several reasons for that. Validators aren't miners, mostly because decentralised staking is a thing, but mining is heavily organized via mining pools (of course pools also exist in PoS, see stETH/LDO and rETH/RPL and some more). Since validating blocks after the merge is more decentralised, the average staker is most likely a little less sophisticated than a mining pool. Talking for myself, until I learned about MEV-boost I didn't really feel comfortable staking from home cause I was aware I would most likely lose a significant portion of rewards because I would be missing out MEV. Also with the move to PoS we will know whose turn it will be at which block height, since validators are basically notified about their turn in advance (I think 12 blocks IIRC). MEV-boost will replace MEV-geht which is the flashbots product right now. On top there is something new called PBS or proposer builder separation.   \n\n\nNow what's a proposer and what's a builder and why are we gonna separate them?  \n\\- A proposer is the validator. A validator can propose a block and other validators will accept it usually. (There is some nuance to that I think, but I'll leave that for the future if people think it's important/ interesting).  \n\\- A builder is a person/ entity that builds the block. This means a builder takes all the valid transactions it has received, puts them in the relevant positions within a block (based on their priority fee/ tip/ MEV) and forwards it to the proposer.  \n\n\nThe proposer is basically a \"meta seacher\". They include transactions from searchers and fill up the block with normal transactions based\u00a0on value to build the\u00a0optimal block from a MEV point of view.\u00a0Now a proposer can be a builder - if you don't use MEV-boost that's what's going to happen. In that case the proposer most likely misses out returns, because some transactions are unknown and the proposer doesn't propose the block with the maximum amount of EV. Since block building (trying to maximise MEV) will most likely be harder every day, the idea is to allow professionals to do the building and compete with each other. On top there will be\u00a0a \"market for blocks\" and proposers will accept the highest bid. But if the proposer uses MEV-boost it will only propose a block a third party = builder has built, hence the term proposer builder separation. (Also some crazy form of MEV potentially harms the protocol, like reorgs or \"time bandit attacks\" were discussed heavily last year, but these are out of scope for now)  \n\n\nThere are even more parties involved in this setup (e.g. relayers and as stated searchers are obviously still in play), but for now let's keep it as simple as possible.\u00a0\n\nRight now PBS is not baked in or enshrined. It uses technology built by a centralized 3rd party (flashbots), but down the road the goal is to change that and include PBS on the protocol level. There is no timeline for that, because afaik there isn't even a final design, because we have no data (since PoS isn't live yet) and we still need to learn and discuss potential solutions and design decisions. Some people are talking about 1-2 years, but these are really just estimations and imo one year seems really unlikely, but let's see.\u00a0\n\nOnce PBS is enshrined there will most likely also be a censorship resistance mechanism, which I think is great and needed. Why? Pools like Lido could censor transactions by not including certain transactions (e.g. for more or less valid reasons like OFAC compliance, but obviously also reasons we probably wouldn't support like censoring a competitor, etc.). With the help of a cr-list = censorship resistance list a transaction would definitely make it into the next block if it missed X blocks but fulfills all other requirements (e.g. pays the base fee and is technically considered valid). I think this is great, because it basically makes validators less powerful, and hence also minimises their legal liabilities. If you couldn't limit a transaction technically then 3rd party blacklists don't really matter anymore. (I guess in a worst case scenario then validating at all could be a legal problem, if the law states that by just proposing a block with a blacklisted address you can be charged, but I hope down the road legislators will understand that doesn't make a lot of sense, since there is no choice)\n\nThere is one thing that I find really interesting and that's MEV smoothing. Right now a validator/ proposer can basically be very lucky and propose a block with a lot of MEV, or unlucky and propose a block with little to no MEV. If you are part of a LSD pool like Lido or Rocket Pool you don't care too much, because the bell curve will just do its magic and your returns will be smooth anyways. That's not really true for solo stakers, for them MEV is a high variance play. But that could change in the future if MEV smoothing is done on the protocol level as well. The protocol could pool the MEV of X blocks and redistribute to all proposers of that period. But there are some questions that still need to be answered, e.g. if I as a validator don't want to max MEV, but include transactions that I think are more important (but pay less)/ don't want to include front-running because it harms participants, do I still receive the average share?\u00a0On top there was a very interesting point in one of the podcasts: We don't want to overpay for security, I think we all agree, right? Because of that EIP-1559 made it into protocol last summer. Now if the returns via MEV basically lead to an average APY of 10% or more (that's just my assumption for this thought experiment here, not a prediction, just to explain the idea), are we overpaying validators? And if we are overpaying, could we build something like EIP-1559 for the smoothening pool? So basically not redistribute the whole MEV collected, but burn a certain part of it and only redistribute the remainder. As stated, right now this really just is an idea. I don't think it is discussed publicly and I am not sure how many supporters there (if at all), but it is one option in the design space if something like a MEV smoothening happens on the protocol level and even though I am invested in e.g. rETH I think we really need to discuss stuff like this once we have more data - even if that means my returns (via staking) are lower, obviously the burned amount could technically still benefit (by e.g. making the ultra sound meme even more ultra). If we agreed that we are overpaying for security, would you support something like this even if it diminishes your financial\u00a0benefit?\u00a0I understand that this is hard to answer since not even the smoothening pool is a reality...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There are many things in crypto I really enjoy learning about, but I was (perceived) never in a position to really understand everything fundamentally.

If we agreed that we are overpaying for security, would you support something like this even if it diminishes your financial\u00a0benefit?\u00a0I understand that this is hard to answer since not even the smoothening pool is a reality...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-08 01:17:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"inkavg3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x8r22n","parent_id":"t3_x8r22n","score":55,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"Some podcasts that I really enjoyed listening to:\n\n\\- [Uncommon Core: Interview with a MEV searcher](https://anchor.fm/uncommoncore/episodes/Interview-with-a-Searcher---with-MEV-Senpai-and-Hasu-e14n9nq)\n\n\\- [Bankless: Ethereum Uncensored](https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/134-ethereum-unsensored-with-justin#details)\n\n\\- [Zero Knowlege Podcast: Dive Back into MEV](https://zeroknowledge.fm/243-2/) (that's the one where they talk about MEV smoothing)\n\nThere were actually some more episodes in the last couple of weeks, especially wrt to PBS that are really helpful, some on bankless, some on Uncommon Core, so I really think these are also worth checking out.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some podcasts that I really enjoyed listening to:</p>\n\n<p>- <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/uncommoncore/episodes/Interview-with-a-Searcher---with-MEV-Senpai-and-Hasu-e14n9nq\">Uncommon Core: Interview with a MEV searcher</a></p>\n\n<p>- <a href=\"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/134-ethereum-unsensored-with-justin#details\">Bankless: Ethereum Uncensored</a></p>\n\n<p>- <a href=\"https://zeroknowledge.fm/243-2/\">Zero Knowlege Podcast: Dive Back into MEV</a> (that&#39;s the one where they talk about MEV smoothing)</p>\n\n<p>There were actually some more episodes in the last couple of weeks, especially wrt to PBS that are really helpful, some on bankless, some on Uncommon Core, so I really think these are also worth checking out.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-08 01:25:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"inkbgdp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x8r22n","parent_id":"t1_inkavg3","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"This is a Great write up thank you.

If someone wants to pay 50$ for a pound of beef or 20$ a gallon for gas that is taxed appropriately they should be allowed to do so as well. </p>\n\n<p>A carbon tax and dividend could significantly improve wealth inequality and massively change the tide of the fight against climate change but the root of the problem needs to be addressed not arbitrarily banning random things that are politically unpopular</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-08 11:53:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"inmihm8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x8r22n","parent_id":"t1_inm1cbz","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"I think things that are fundamentally and obviously fucking stupid, like PoW at scale, should be banned.
