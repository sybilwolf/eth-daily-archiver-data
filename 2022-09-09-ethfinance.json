ETH is going to be more disinflationary/deflationary than BTC, so yes it is going to be a harder form of money. To say I am incredibly bullish on the Merge is an understatement.\n\nBut one counterpoint in the interest of presenting a more balanced/nuanced picture: as far as sound money goes, BTC has one important advantage that ETH can't really match: consistency. BTC has had the same 'monetary policy' from its inception. And that policy is widely regarded as the single most defining aspect of BTC. \n\nThis is simply not true for ETH, which has had a more fluid policy that has evolved over time. While I welcome the changes that ETH has made, those changes introduce an element of doubt and uncertainty around whether the new policies will be permanent or not. This fluidity/human element is what drives so much angst about fiat. \n\nI don't anticipate further changes in ETH's policy, but it will take time for people to be convinced that the post-Merge policy is truly set in stone. Time is the only thing that can really solidify this perception, and even then, BTC will still hold the upper hand in this particular regard, especially given how foundational its policy has been to its identity. I really believe this matters to people who are looking for the soundest possible form of money (myself included).\n\nNow, you may argue that BTC may eventually need to change its policy if fees remain too low to provide adequate security over time, as new issuance continues to dwindle. That's a valid concern, but one that is still pretty far off on the horizon. A lot can change between now and then.\n\nOne other thought--your point about the lower energy consumption is fair, and I do believe BTC is going to face ever-increasing blowback regarding its energy intensity. That said, with ETH PoS, ideally we want to see lower energy consumption while maintaining or even improving decentralization.

Time will tell.\n\nRegardless, I'm bullish on both BTC and ETH, and moreso for ETH. Bring on the Merge!!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In many ways you&#39;re not wrong... ETH is going to be more disinflationary/deflationary than BTC, so yes it is going to be a harder form of money. To say I am incredibly bullish on the Merge is an understatement.</p>\n\n<p>But one counterpoint in the interest of presenting a more balanced/nuanced picture: as far as sound money goes, BTC has one important advantage that ETH can&#39;t really match: consistency. BTC has had the same &#39;monetary policy&#39; from its inception. And that policy is widely regarded as the single most defining aspect of BTC. </p>\n\n<p>This is simply not true for ETH, which has had a more fluid policy that has evolved over time. While I welcome the changes that ETH has made, those changes introduce an element of doubt and uncertainty around whether the new policies will be permanent or not. This fluidity/human element is what drives so much angst about fiat. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t anticipate further changes in ETH&#39;s policy, but it will take time for people to be convinced that the post-Merge policy is truly set in stone. Time is the only thing that can really solidify this perception, and even then, BTC will still hold the upper hand in this particular regard, especially given how foundational its policy has been to its identity. I really believe this matters to people who are looking for the soundest possible form of money (myself included).</p>\n\n<p>Now, you may argue that BTC may eventually need to change its policy if fees remain too low to provide adequate security over time, as new issuance continues to dwindle. That&#39;s a valid concern, but one that is still pretty far off on the horizon. A lot can change between now and then.</p>\n\n<p>One other thought--your point about the lower energy consumption is fair, and I do believe BTC is going to face ever-increasing blowback regarding its energy intensity. That said, with ETH PoS, ideally we want to see lower energy consumption while maintaining or even improving decentralization. To that end, I think we need to see how PoS plays out, specifically how prominent of a role is played by centralized staking services. While I think ETH PoS theoretically has the potential to be highly decentralized (moreso than under a PoW system), the current popularity of centralized solutions suggests that the jury is out for now.

The problem is the network is only as secure as its regular lowest mining difficulty, where any consensus attacker can profit from the reduced security to get 51% of the consensus and 100% of the reward, ensuring they get all rewards whenever the energy surplus isn&#39;t enough.</p>\n\n<p>Besides, you&#39;re right, there are alternatives that are coming. For instance, I&#39;ve seen some companies trying to use sand towers to store lots of energy as heated sand to use in order to provide hot water to closest places. They were claiming it could store energy for months and solve a part of the problem of unreliable energy surplus from renewable energy sources.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-09 15:57:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"insdvvm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x9md3j","parent_id":"t1_inpqtr8","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/ProfStrangelove","body":"We only have to wait for Fusion reactors to finally be ready /s","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>We only have to wait for Fusion reactors to finally be ready /s</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-09 03:28:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"inpjh5y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x9md3j","parent_id":"t1_inpiw0q","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/ProfStrangelove","body":"Yeah well that's basically what I said?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah well that&#39;s basically what I said?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-09 03:26:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"inpjckc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x9md3j","parent_id":"t1_inpdvwh","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Perleflamme","body":"If so, then, good.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If so, then, good.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-09 03:47:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"inpl428","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x9md3j","parent_id":"t1_inpjckc","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Childsp","body":"My bet is that most of the government (s) in Europe and the US will severely cut ties with BTC but then China will unban it again sparking a buying frenzy within their country.

I've read through the technical documentation for a fair number of ETH competitors now and think I have a decent idea of what to look for.\n\n----\n\nSo let's see about their [SPoS documentation](https://docs.elrond.com/technology/secure-proof-of-stake/) first. Across the different blockchains I've read about, I get the impression that PoS (and its prefixed variants) does tend to just work. The research has been done to find out what you need for PoS to function okay, and then every blockchain makes minor changes to the timing of voting rounds or source of randomness. I usually don't see how these changes make the consensus algorithm better.\n\n**SPoS:**\n\n* Is generally just a marketing term. I would classify this as a fairly standard dPoS consensus algorithm.\n* Bases selection of the next block proposer on a source of randomness from only the immediately previous block. I quote the docs: \"SPoS is built on the premise that a malevolent actor cannot adapt faster than the timeframe allowed by a round in order to influence the block that will be proposed.\" This strikes me as dangerous. Unless I'm missing something, it means that a block proposer can both predict and control who the next block proposer will be, only limited by how much they can brute-force search over the 6-second block time.\n* Has 6-second round times, as compared to Ethereum's 12-second slot times. There are many factors that go into this decision and the numbers may not actually be comparable, but at first glance I would wonder if this leans towards tx throughout/latency at the expense of more frequent reorgs.\n* Does not mention slashing, meaning it cannot make Ethereum's guarantees about the financial cost of reverting finalized blocks. They do give validators \"rating scores\" based on performance ([details](https://docs.elrond.com/validators/rating/)), which affect probability of selection and therefore returns. Rating is generally based on performing regular proposal and verification duties, and punish downtime moreso than malicious behavior. This seems to provide financial *incentives* to attacking other validators (with ETH the worst you can do is deny another validator's income, not boost your own).\n\n----\n\nLet's see about their [scalability solutions](https://docs.elrond.com/technology/adaptive-state-sharding/). This often takes some reading between the lines, because it's easy to say you support tens of thousands of TPS while conveniently leaving out that all your nodes need to be supercomputers with data center Internet connections. Elrond claims to achieve scalability through sharding, which may be more interesting to evaluate, but I don't quite know how to do so.\n\n**Adaptive State Sharding:**\n\n* Is described to face the following challenges: \"...single-shard takeover attack, potentially intensive cross-shard communication, overall data availability and also the need of an abstraction layer that hides the shards.\" Really evaluating how they've done in addressing these challenges requires a deeper dive than I'm giving it.\n* I quote: \"The Elrond network is the first to present a viable solution where all the three aspects of sharding - state, network and transactions - have been implemented at once.\" This is marketing gibberish: the way they describe it, any sharding system will implement all three.\n* Shuffles a small subset of validators between shards once every epoch (24 hours). Since changing shards requires resynchronization, validators are placed on a waiting list for one epoch to give them time to do so. I once again wonder if the single-block source of randomness opens this up to attacks, either by avoiding shard shuffling to minimize waiting list time, or by brute-force searching for configurations that put many colluding validators on one shard.\n* Uses [miniblocks and a metachain](https://docs.elrond.com/technology/cross-shard-transactions/) to enable cross-shard communication for even regular transactions. It seems that for a user this should be a seamless experience: sharding doesn't break composability. I can see how this could be more computationally and bandwidthly intense than than only having intra-shard communication, while still having more total throughput than an unsharded chain. I hope they have carefully set parameters for this and sufficiently optimized their code, but that's hard for me to check now.\n* Distributes addresses effectively randomly between shards. Since it's all composable that's fine, but sharding designs with less composable shards often hope to gain efficiency by having the shard be a choice; if you want to use Uniswap and Uniswap is on shard 3, you make an address on shard 3 as well. In that design, cross-shard communication is rarer than in Elrond, cutting down on those costs at the expense of composability.\n* Is currently running with [4 shards](https://docs.elrond.com/welcome/welcome-to-elrond/).\n\n----\n\nThe last big topic is something that's become more prominent recently: the [developer experience](https://docs.elrond.com/technology/the-elrond-wasm-vm/). I do not know if there is data on how much this actually matters to devs as compared to e.g. developing and deploying wherever the users happen to be (cough ethereum), but it is a large part of marketing for any modern L1. ETHDenver was full of alt-L1s looking to poach Ethereum developers.\n\n**For developers, Elrond:**\n\n* Runs a WASM VM, so supports any language that compiles to WASM bytecode, but encourages using Rust. This is a popular choice nowadays; I could see the ecosystem as a whole settling on Solidity/EVM and Rust/WASM as the two main long-term platforms.\n* Does not have an EVM chain or Solidity compiler, something that other L1s often fit in somewhere to be more attractive to eth devs.\n* Invisibly handles cross-shard smart contract calls asynchronously, telling developers to act as if they're synchronous. This is kind of hilarious and I'm very curious to see it all fall apart as soon as one shard has a contentious reorg.\n* Has native support for fungible and nonfungible tokens: they don't go through the VM so they're faster. This is a common tradeoff in modern alt-L1s that gives up flexibility in programmability in exchange for speed. Though the programmability in ERC-20s is often used to make sneaky scams so maybe there's an argument to be made for enforcing one standard.\n\n----\n\n**Misc:**\n\n* Advertises a 21.45% annual return for validators and 15-19% for delegators while also advertising $0.001 fees, meaning they're subsidizing growth via inflation (not fun for token holders) in a likely unsustainable way. 59% of EGLD tokens are staked, so uhhh yeah.\n* Minimum system requirements are 4x dedicated physical CPUs, 8 GB RAM, 200 GB SSD, 100 Mbps data. The CPU requirement seems oddly high, requiring a workstation/server setup while the other requirements are oddly low. I didn't see any mention of state expiry, so 200 GB isn't going to last long under their claims of high TPS and low fees. Having 24 hours to resync when switching shards may be a concern with just 100 Mbps as the shards grow.\n* [Transactions cost gas](https://docs.elrond.com/developers/gas-and-fees/overview/) based on the number and type of operations performed, txs are submitted with a gas limit, all as we are used to on Ethereum. Gas price in EGLD is reported on the [explorer](https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/c208256d7c164303cd6d04ddd7beb820c966416454875c4acd24a1fce00c3745) (currently 0.000000001 EGLD) but I don't know if it is set via fee market, dev team fiat, or governance.\n* In the explorer now, blocks are mostly empty, coming through with 5-30 transactions (on each of 4 shards) and cost a few USD cents worth of gas. That seems like a dead chain? I've been only looking at this based on their technical documentation; if their team rugpulled or the chain suffered a hack or if they just suck at marketing so bad that nobody cares, I wouldn't be aware of it. Maybe the main use of the chain is to try to get that sweet 21% return and exit before price collapses.\n* There are exactly 3,200 validator nodes worldwide; I think this is a deliberate target number. Running a validator requires 2500 staked EGLD (1 EGLD ~= $50), putting the minimum collateral requirement at ~$125k. It's dPoS, so most regular users just delegate while a small number of users actually run the validators. There are at most [386 unique validator-operating humans](https://explorer.elrond.com/validators), likely closer to half that.\n* I saw it mentioned somewhere that their [official mobile wallet](https://maiar.com/#features) has social recovery, which sounds nice if I could actually confirm it. Side note: that website has some *really* uninspired stock photos.\n* I really really don't like that their home page has a floating banner trying to get people to buy EGLD with their credit cards. I don't like that on their wallet homepage they push their referral program.\n\n----\n\n**To conclude**. Their consensus algorithm is run of the mill dPoS. Their sharding design is interesting, but the devil is in the details and the large amount of cross-shard communication makes me skeptical of its scalability. I have some security concerns that maybe one of their devs would have good answers for if I asked. They do a lot of trendy alt-L1 things like using a WASM VM and using unsustainable token inflation to subsidize growth. The chain has very low activity, and I wonder if there is some factor outside the technical details that has impacted adoption.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I haven&#39;t heard of Elrond before, but I would like to think the technical aspects of the blockchain shouldn&#39;t be dismissed prematurely on the basis of &quot;their website has a contact sales link and is only a slightly modified WordPress theme, and their PoS has a prefix&quot;.
