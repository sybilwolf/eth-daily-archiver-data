It defines flexible data structures and ways to find them on a network. What IPFS is not is a network in itself. It does not describe how, when and by who things should be stored. So you are left with trying to find centralized entities that will &quot;pin&quot; (read store) data for you. This is not decentralized, it&#39;s awkward and it&#39;s often slow. Afaik what the &quot;web3&quot; storage providers are doing these days is pinning your data onto IPFS while also backing it up on Filecoin, so centralized gateway onto decentralized storage in a way. Estuary and Textile are examples of such services. This stuff is in constant flux, lots of development.
