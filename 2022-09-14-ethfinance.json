My brother followed suit who was just as much of a Bitcoin evangelist for years as I was. We both took a leap of faith. We both are financially free today because of it and owe so much to everyone involved we will never be able to repay. Ethereum changed my life and I continue to buy and hodl today.</p>\n\n<p>I evangelize for Ethereum as much as I used to for Bitcoin back in the day. I&#39;ve always been here for human freedom and wealth. I&#39;ve got one. I won&#39;t fucking be satisfied until I have both.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that some of you like me around these parts and some despise me. This is the very nature of open and accessible Blockchain tech. Good, bad, ugly we all get to participate as we see fit and are free to do so. Bitcoin&#39;s original intent was to onboard the bottom 50%, not the top 1%. It failed. Ethereum will succeed in fulfilling Satoshi&#39;s vision of economic inclusion worldwide come hell or high water. This is my stance.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You never change things by fighting the existing reality.\nTo change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We are all blessed to be a part of history in the making.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-14 19:12:29","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-09-14 19:15:02","id":"ioh91ip","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xdsyg7","parent_id":"t3_xdsyg7","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/doyourduty","body":"Well said!
