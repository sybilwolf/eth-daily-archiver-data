Of course, this came out literally an hour ago, so nobody has had a chance to test it. They have an [RPC URL now, too](https://twitter.com/EthereumPoW/status/1570413723969552385), so in theory people should be able to add the network to Metamask without worrying about replay attacks from ETH's chain ID 1 and ETHPoW's chain ID 10001. There is [another chain with that chain ID](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/blob/master/_data/chains/eip155-10001.json), but I don't think anybody uses it. Their [block explorer](https://mainnet.ethwscan.com/) is down because they're technically incompetent, and when I remove the \"mainnet\" prefix from their URL, both Metamask and my router warn me of malware and do their best to stop me from getting there.\n\nETHPoW has a [modification to their geth code](https://github.com/ethereumpow/go-ethereum/commit/4b273d6de7bb595ed5eb001571520e8351ffcfaa#diff-8c398ef0a79f97ba6d497a99247a815b3a51918de9e16954215b6073f907c92eR347) which, if I'm reading this right, takes the amount of ETHW burned by EIP-1559 and mints an equal amount, sending it to an address labeled in comments as \"minerDAO\", which is a [5-of-10 Gnosis safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x01c2C2FB1C31d902FA6C8A5A60a93353704BA4bc#code) but should be enough to convince anyone that this is a sleazy cash grab.\n\n----\n\nI'm only recently hearing about EthereumFair (ETF), as I think everyone is. They've been around for [maybe a month or so](https://twitter.com/EthereumFair/status/1554719657051189249), but their tweets have gotten likes in the single digits, so literally nobody cares. The big surprise was [Poloniex announcing](https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/8891918365335) that they are listing ETF as their representation of PoW ETH forks. They claim it \"is supported by the community's majority and more PoW computing power\" which is likely BS but I'm not trying to defend ETHW's legitimacy or anything.\n\nThey do have an [RPC set up](https://twitter.com/EthereumFair/status/1570322701457453057) with a [chain ID with no conflicts](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/blob/master/_data/chains/eip155-513100.json). So in theory, could be added to Metamask without fear of replay attack.\n\nEthereumFair's plan is to [unlock all staked ETF in the deposit contract](https://twitter.com/EthereumFair/status/1560636478589669378), distributing it as an airdrop to holders of BTC, DOGE, ETC, and CZZ. That should sound a little strange (how do you airdrop tokens on an ETH fork to BTC holders?), but it is set up [in code](https://github.com/ethereumfair/go-ethereum/commit/03c18dd1f0bb4cb05a3921b8e2e2ca7968203875) so we can see what's going on. Their address for BTC does point to a [contract on mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x96e19b42dfe3f3f6bf6d3fdf031e489ac5735550#code) which allows for distribution of the tokens to a list designated by the owner. We can see on the [ETF block explorer](https://explorer.etherfair.org/address/0x96E19B42dFe3F3f6bF6D3Fdf031E489AC5735550) that the BTC distributor address does contain millions of ETF, as intended, but there haven't been any transactions to the contract yet, so the recipients have not been set. The block explorer is kind of unstable though.\n\nEither way, with the staked ETF unlocked but distributors not set up, there is nothing stopping the people behind this fork from taking it all (>10% of supply) for themselves. Except their pride and nonexistent reputation, I guess.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ll be talking about PoW forks here.

They&#39;ve been around for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EthereumFair/status/1554719657051189249\">maybe a month or so</a>, but their tweets have gotten likes in the single digits, so literally nobody cares. The big surprise was <a href=\"https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/8891918365335\">Poloniex announcing</a> that they are listing ETF as their representation of PoW ETH forks. They claim it &quot;is supported by the community&#39;s majority and more PoW computing power&quot; which is likely BS but I&#39;m not trying to defend ETHW&#39;s legitimacy or anything.</p>\n\n<p>They do have an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EthereumFair/status/1570322701457453057\">RPC set up</a> with a <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/blob/master/_data/chains/eip155-513100.json\">chain ID with no conflicts</a>. So in theory, could be added to Metamask without fear of replay attack.</p>\n\n<p>EthereumFair&#39;s plan is to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EthereumFair/status/1560636478589669378\">unlock all staked ETF in the deposit contract</a>, distributing it as an airdrop to holders of BTC, DOGE, ETC, and CZZ. That should sound a little strange (how do you airdrop tokens on an ETH fork to BTC holders?), but it is set up <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereumfair/go-ethereum/commit/03c18dd1f0bb4cb05a3921b8e2e2ca7968203875\">in code</a> so we can see what&#39;s going on. Their address for BTC does point to a <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x96e19b42dfe3f3f6bf6d3fdf031e489ac5735550#code\">contract on mainnet</a> which allows for distribution of the tokens to a list designated by the owner. We can see on the <a href=\"https://explorer.etherfair.org/address/0x96E19B42dFe3F3f6bF6D3Fdf031E489AC5735550\">ETF block explorer</a> that the BTC distributor address does contain millions of ETF, as intended, but there haven&#39;t been any transactions to the contract yet, so the recipients have not been set. The block explorer is kind of unstable though.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, with the staked ETF unlocked but distributors not set up, there is nothing stopping the people behind this fork from taking it all (&gt;10% of supply) for themselves. Except their pride and nonexistent reputation, I guess.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-15 09:41:10","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-09-15 10:05:24","id":"iojtyyh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xenp6l","parent_id":"t3_xenp6l","score":50,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"I literally have more respect for ETC than any of this crap.

This absolutely should have been caught in testing.

My Embarrassment! \ud83d\udc3b\u200d\u2744\ufe0f &#39;Sup homies! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb Man so like I haven&#39;t slept in at least 85 hours now, but no worries! I got my 6th wind and an adrenaline shot on standby, so I&#39;m good to go for at least another 24!</p>\n\n<p>I just wanted to say I minted my ELPanda, and it&#39;s f&#39;ing awesome as all hell, so to celebrate I added a special badge for <a href=\"https://caches.xyz\">Caches</a> members that have one! Just log in with the wallet you have your ELPanda NFT in and you&#39;ll automatically get the Panda badge next to your name, just like the EVM badge! If you&#39;re already logged in, log out and then back in to get awarded! How cool is that!?</p>\n\n<p>Oh ... and in case you&#39;ve been hit in the head as much as I have and your memory is total garbage like mine is, let me remind you that login is totally anonymous to everyone, even me! \ud83d\udc40 I also stop tracking you with analytics once you&#39;re logged in! You&#39;re like a panda ghost or something! How sweet is that?! Damn sweet is right homies.</p>\n\n<p>For now ELPanda&#39;s don&#39;t get any special privileges but that could change in the future, so go check it out!</p>\n\n<p><sup>[caches ongoing development thread](<a href=\"https://caches.xyz/forums/discussion/caches-ongoing-development-thread-suggests-feedback-accepted/\">https://caches.xyz/forums/discussion/caches-ongoing-development-thread-suggests-feedback-accepted/</a></sup>)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-15 11:09:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iok7n98","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xenp6l","parent_id":"t3_xenp6l","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Sku","body":"muerehtE","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>muerehtE</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-14 22:00:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iohs5q0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xenp6l","parent_id":"t3_xenp6l","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/OkDragonfruit1929","body":"Livestream sits upon a throne of lies atop a mountain of misinformation.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Livestream sits upon a throne of lies atop a mountain of misinformation.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-14 22:45:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iohw7ds","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xenp6l","parent_id":"t3_xenp6l","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/robohack","body":"I have been duped as well.
