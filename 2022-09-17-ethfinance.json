This is how it works. </p>\n\n<p>You bring 16 eth, and the protocol lends you 16 eth. You put those eth together to get 32 eth and you stake it. However, the 16 eth you borrow has to be protected. You do that by providing 1.6 eth worth of the rpl token as insurance. So, the total amount you have to provide is 17.6 eth value in total (from 16 eth and 1.6 eth worth of rpl). </p>\n\n<p>That, then provides you with the around 6% rewards you get for staking on your 16 eth and 15% of the rewards you get from the protocol as a commission for what you\u2019re staking. After that, you also get ~12% returns on your rpl tokens too. </p>\n\n<p>The 10% you provide as rpl is the minimum. The maximum can be as high as 150% of the eth you provide. This is what I have done because I\u2019m bullish on rpl and because I want those rewards!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-17 13:36:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ioua54a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xgd5ak","parent_id":"t1_iou52cj","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Vegan_Intolerant","body":"I love this community","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I love this community</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-17 14:44:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ioujl3a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xgd5ak","parent_id":"t1_ioua54a","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/waqwaqattack","body":"It\u2019s one of the best","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s one of the best</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-17 21:55:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iow09aq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xgd5ak","parent_id":"t1_ioujl3a","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/barthib","body":"Thanks a lot for the details","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks a lot for the details</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-17 14:10:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iouetpq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xgd5ak","parent_id":"t1_ioua54a","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/waqwaqattack","body":"You\u2019re welcome.
