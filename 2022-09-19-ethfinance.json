The overall percentage of these validators is *incredibly* minuscule, but [these 43 unique proposers](https://beaconcha.in/address/0000000000000000000000000000000000000001#blocksMined) have collectively forfeited 7.61 ETH in fees worth ~ $10,501. \n\n(For those unaware: In Ethereum proof-of-stake, validators who propose a block now receive a portion of that block's transaction fees. These extra fees are separate from the block reward and are sent directly to an address the validator designates. If a validator fails to designate an address, the fee is effectively burned.)\n\nAccording to beaconcha.in tags and validator graffiti, the biggest culprit is the custodial, liquid staking service **Ankr**. At least 32 Ankr validators did not have a fee recipient address set. The next two largest offenders are 2 Kraken validators and 2 LIDO validators, but those proposal happened a few hours after the merge and no Kraken or LIDO validators have popped up since. \n\nNext down the list, two apparent home stakers running Lighthouse as their consensus layer client - one of them active since the beaconchain genesis - failed to set the fee address. A third home staker using the graffiti \"Freedom for all\" has also failed to do so. \n\nTwo validators that appear to belong to an institutional staker (due to their graffiti: \"Staker2-US-Eth-03\") have also forfeited their fees.\n\nAnd finally, one person using the non-custodial staking service Bloxstaking forfeited 0.07 ETH in one of their recent proposals and one validator using the semi-custodial service Stakefish gave up 0.04 ETH. \n\nOverall, it's actually quite impressive that so few validators (with a post-merge proposal) have failed to set the fee address...but I guess it really shouldn't be all that surprising. It's really just one more salient data point that proves that in PoS, there very much is \"something\" at stake. Validators are not only responsible for making sure they don't break the consensus rules and get slashed, but they are also effectively punished for being neglectful. They may not be losing any of their stake by not setting a fee recipient, but they are losing out ([sometimes big](https://beaconcha.in/block/15539447)) on a nice extra incentive for securing Ethereum. \n\n \n&nbsp;\n\n*Here's a breakdown of all 43 block proposals that did not have fee recipient:*\n\nService | # of proposals | ETH forfeited\n---|---|----\nAnkr | 32  | 4.96 \nLIDO | 2 | 2.10\nKraken | 2 | 0.18\nUnknown institutional staker | 2 | 0.17\nHome stakers | 3 | 0.09\nBloxstaking | 1 | 0.07\nStakefish | 1 | 0.04","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The Merge happened almost 5 days ago.

A third home staker using the graffiti &quot;Freedom for all&quot; has also failed to do so. </p>\n\n<p>Two validators that appear to belong to an institutional staker (due to their graffiti: &quot;Staker2-US-Eth-03&quot;) have also forfeited their fees.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, one person using the non-custodial staking service Bloxstaking forfeited 0.07 ETH in one of their recent proposals and one validator using the semi-custodial service Stakefish gave up 0.04 ETH. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, it&#39;s actually quite impressive that so few validators (with a post-merge proposal) have failed to set the fee address...but I guess it really shouldn&#39;t be all that surprising. It&#39;s really just one more salient data point that proves that in PoS, there very much is &quot;something&quot; at stake. Validators are not only responsible for making sure they don&#39;t break the consensus rules and get slashed, but they are also effectively punished for being neglectful. They may not be losing any of their stake by not setting a fee recipient, but they are losing out (<a href=\"https://beaconcha.in/block/15539447\">sometimes big</a>) on a nice extra incentive for securing Ethereum. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Here&#39;s a breakdown of all 43 block proposals that did not have fee recipient:</em></p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Service</th>\n<th># of proposals</th>\n<th>ETH forfeited</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ankr</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>4.96</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LIDO</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2.10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kraken</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0.18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unknown institutional staker</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0.17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Home stakers</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>0.09</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bloxstaking</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0.07</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stakefish</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0.04</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-19 16:55:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ip4qtdh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xi2eus","parent_id":"t3_xi2eus","score":57,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/interweaver","body":"Really interesting.

This one is annoying because there is a pure lack of data. The dune analytics dashboards appear to only work against L1 but Rarible has pivoted to multi-chain. Furthermore, I couldn't find their treasury address or even verify many things I was able to find some written evidence about. It probably won't matter though given my conclusions.\n\nRarible launched their token [over 2 years ago](https://rarible.medium.com/introducing-rari-the-first-governance-token-in-the-nft-space-5dbcc55b6c43) at this point. The price has come full circle from coming out of Defi winter to some speculative highs back to basically an all time low on the ETH ratio. Rarible is suffering from two problems. First, a lack of adoption. Second, a lack of revenue model.\n\nRegarding adoption I\u2019m not finding a reliable data source that includes their protocol and multi-chain volume but low end estimates are in ~$500k volume per month. There is some data available [here](https://dune.com/alexfal/rarible) but I think it\u2019s limited to their website traffic. Exchange volume plummets sharply in October 2021. It\u2019s been a rough year for them. In their [first year](https://rarible.medium.com/rarible-2020-a-year-in-review-e980e54f28a5) they averaged $8.5M trading volume per month. Their [second year](https://rarible.medium.com/rarible-2021-a-year-in-review-d6d6fed3a4c4) was the real NFT boom and they averaged over $22M in trading volume per month and expanded to multi-chain on Tezos and Flow. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m just missing a lot of data in the dashboards I\u2019m finding because otherwise they have dropped to about $500k trading volume in July through September which is not inspiring confidence. You might say the whole market is showing lower volumes but their competitor Magic Eden just posted their ATH volume day earlier this month and even compared to the market average this is a significant drop. Their major achievement this year has been a multi-chain launch on Polygon. Again, I\u2019m hoping I can find clear data on their multi-chain volume.\n\nContributing to this lack of adoption is probably their take on verifying accounts. Unlike SuperRare which takes a curated gallery approach where the community selects the gallery operator who serves as the scam resistance layer Rarible takes a KYC approach to Sybil resistance and their staff verifies each account. This gating process overwhelmed them during the NFT bull market which pushed adoption to other exchanges akin to the issues Kyber or Bancor faced in the DEX market compared to Uniswap. Permissionless is a powerful thing and they didn\u2019t have it in a place it counted. There was some intention at token launch to decentralize this process but it apparently hasn\u2019t been prioritized because there\u2019s nothing in their medium feed about it.\n\nOutside of their website their major strategic investment is in a set of smart contracts and SDK called the Rarible Protocol. It provides an SDK that enables partners like Twitter, Decentraland, and Adobe to offer NFT integration in their products. While this is promising the list of partnerships is not expanding at a rate I would say has bootstrapped the flywheel yet. Still, if you have to pick a strategic direction, this is at least something unique that targets business to business use cases instead of the highly competitive user trading use case.\n\nRegarding their revenue model, the only fees I can find are a 1% service fee on NFT trades and a protocol fee which is currently set to 0. This is much less than the 15% initial sale fee on SuperRare but it doesn\u2019t seem to have attracted the NFT creators or traders in an enduring way. Given the lack of volume I\u2019m seeing, I\u2019m basically putting this down as 0 revenue. There is a company behind Rarible and those devs are getting paid but from what I can tell they are living off seed round funding. So, they have a good few million in runway but unless something changes in their adoption they appear to be heading the way of many tokens from past bull markets.\n\nOnto token distribution. The original airdrop for RARI was to users of Rarible and other NFT exchanges. This distribution was designed as a marketing effort and an olive branch to the NFT community. 30% to investors and team isn't unusual for this space but I couldn't find a vesting schedule. 60% for LM sounds promising at first if you're targeting community ownership but that plan changed and I can't figure out what happens to the tokens that were supposed to go here. At inception the plan was to run a liquidity mining program for about 4 years for 75,000 RARI to NFT buyers and sellers each week. At some point this was converted to 41,250 tokens per week to Rari Protocol partners. Then in [January 2022](https://rarible.medium.com/following-the-community-vote-rari-weekly-distribution-for-rarible-com-users-ends-on-16th-jan-766294044b47) that program was also discontinued. It\u2019s unclear to me where the uninflated tokens have gone, to a treasury or nowhere at all. There is an outstanding proposal to reinstate the rewards but it appears to be a contentious topic. The loss of these incentives combined with the general bear market appears to have contributed to a significant volume decline.\n\nFrom a market segment perspective Rarible advertises itself as a community-centric, low cost exchange. Outside of the initial airdrop which was community focused I don\u2019t see much follow through on this claim. They appear to have pivoted to a business to business use case whose primary differentiation is the Rarible Protocol. This is evidenced by the shift of their liquidity mining program, lack of a decentralized verification process, and lack of community driven feedback loops. They seem to be living off of seed rounds, there\u2019s no way they are sustaining 100+ employees off of their current trading revenue unless the adoption story on their other chains paints an entirely different picture from L1.\n\nAgain, lots of unknowns here. Let me know if you have a better data source so I can update this.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Continuing on my NFT exchange token <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xtfxo7/daily_general_discussion_october_2_2022/iqpw04t/?context=3\">saga</a> I&#39;m looking at Rarible.

Here's a quick how to:\n\n1. Enter your mainnet account address for tracking at [https://app.defisaver.com/](https://app.defisaver.com/)\n2. Turn on simulation mode ( the switch is in the bottom left corner of the UI) and make sure to select \"your account\" for simulating\n3. Go to the protocol dashboard you need and make a withdrawal action for your ETH amount\n4. Click the tx hash in the top right corner once the simulated tx is done - this will open the Tenderly debugger with the simulated transaction\n5. You need two pieces of data from here: the **Raw Input** and the **Contract Address** (that's the contract you're making a call to/through).\n6. In your MetaMask go to Settings - Advanced and set Show Hex Data to ON.\n7. Switch to the chain where you want to execute the transaction. **Beware of chains that have the same ChainID as Eth Mainnet (1)**.\n8. Open MetMask and enter these inputs:\n   1. Send to: Contract address taken from Tenderly\n   2. Send amount: 0 ETH\n   3. Hex Data: Paste the Raw Input from Tenderly\n9. Gas settings are something I cannot help much with - I've no idea what base feese are on the fork chains or where you can check that, but I would assume it would be lower than on the actual Eth mainnet if they didn't make any changes to how gas works.\n10. MetaMask should properly estimate the gas (units) needed for the tx, or you can round what you saw in Tenderly as Gas Used to the next largest 6 digit number (e.g. if you saw 543,638 gas used, feel free to round it to 600,000 and set that as gas limit).\n\nThat should be it and if you try doing this with any positions on Mainnet you'll see that your tx actually goes through and withdraws your ETH - feel free to try that, it's imho pretty cool to know how to do this.\n\nBut if this doesn't work on the fork chain, then who the heck knows what's going on there.

Who the heck knows.\n\nDisclaimer: I have not done any of this on any PoW fork and I'm not personally interested in interacting with those chains.
