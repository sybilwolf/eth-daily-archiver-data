There were several comments that UNI is not going to make a lot of revenues/ overvalued etc. So to see if my thesis was completely off I did some digging on [CryptoFees.info](https://CryptoFees.info) and would like make some assumptions/ calculations and following a case. \n\nIn May 2021 (a positive outlier in terms of dapp revenues) UNI basically had 3M revenues+ every day with a peak of 17M on  May 19th and several days of 10M+. Lets just assume 6M fees average for May (I can't easily export and am too lazy to check manually). \n\nIn November 2021 (again a positive outlier because of the second peak in general markets) we see a similar picture with a peak of 17M, probably even slightly higher average in terms of fees. \n\nLet's just assume that there is growth with every cycle, hence more transactions (because fees on L2s are lower and more people are managing their finances themselves), hence this outlier revenue is the average revenue for the future. \n\nNow UNI has a max supply of 1B tokens. Let's assume that 60% will be staked when the fee switch is on (probably on the lower side, but since the average is 6M revenues / day you might understand why I picked this. \n\nSo with 600.000.000 tokens staked and 6.000.000 USD and 10% of the overall revenues going to stakers (and not to LP) we would see 600.000 USD a day for stakers = 0,1 cent/ revenue a day = 36,5 cents/ year. With a UNI price of 5$ (more or less) that would be a return of 7%. \n\nNow obviously there are a lot of assumptions here and I can't guarantee these numbers will be met, no one can. All I am trying to say is that with more economic trading happening on chain I do see a valid return for UNI holders and that UNI turning on fees could indeed change the picture, especially since this would probably be reflexive (fees are turned on, bull starts, more tx, more fees, better returns, etc.). Also I think that UNI is not necessarily overvalued right now. \n\nOn top I think that UNI switching fees on is a strong signal for the whole space. I think this would basically lead to most dapps turning on fees for holders, it still is a lighthouse for DeFi imo. Does this mean this bull market is sustainable? Hell no, could lead to a new bubble with token prices overshooting etc.  \n\nThoughts?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So yesterday I made a comment about how I think <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xizkvl/comment/ip6zsnd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">UNI switching on fees</a> could create a new DeFi bull market. There were several comments that UNI is not going to make a lot of revenues/ overvalued etc. So to see if my thesis was completely off I did some digging on <a href=\"https://CryptoFees.info\">CryptoFees.info</a> and would like make some assumptions/ calculations and following a case. </p>\n\n<p>In May 2021 (a positive outlier in terms of dapp revenues) UNI basically had 3M revenues+ every day with a peak of 17M on  May 19th and several days of 10M+. Lets just assume 6M fees average for May (I can&#39;t easily export and am too lazy to check manually). </p>\n\n<p>In November 2021 (again a positive outlier because of the second peak in general markets) we see a similar picture with a peak of 17M, probably even slightly higher average in terms of fees. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s just assume that there is growth with every cycle, hence more transactions (because fees on L2s are lower and more people are managing their finances themselves), hence this outlier revenue is the average revenue for the future. </p>\n\n<p>Now UNI has a max supply of 1B tokens. Let&#39;s assume that 60% will be staked when the fee switch is on (probably on the lower side, but since the average is 6M revenues / day you might understand why I picked this. </p>\n\n<p>So with 600.000.000 tokens staked and 6.000.000 USD and 10% of the overall revenues going to stakers (and not to LP) we would see 600.000 USD a day for stakers = 0,1 cent/ revenue a day = 36,5 cents/ year. With a UNI price of 5$ (more or less) that would be a return of 7%. </p>\n\n<p>Now obviously there are a lot of assumptions here and I can&#39;t guarantee these numbers will be met, no one can. All I am trying to say is that with more economic trading happening on chain I do see a valid return for UNI holders and that UNI turning on fees could indeed change the picture, especially since this would probably be reflexive (fees are turned on, bull starts, more tx, more fees, better returns, etc.). Also I think that UNI is not necessarily overvalued right now. </p>\n\n<p>On top I think that UNI switching fees on is a strong signal for the whole space. I think this would basically lead to most dapps turning on fees for holders, it still is a lighthouse for DeFi imo. Does this mean this bull market is sustainable? Hell no, could lead to a new bubble with token prices overshooting etc.  </p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-21 03:02:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ipb85ze","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xjveii","parent_id":"t3_xjveii","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/MrVodnik","body":"I am the one who disagreed on this yesterday, and I really don't want to get in any argument, but I do have some thoughts on the topic (I've been fighting myself very long time over (not)buying any UNI token).\n\nI agree that your assumptions are plausible and most of the points are valid. I think if UNI was a growth stock in SP500, like Tesla is, then this valuation might make more sense. \n\nIn crypto space I'd value against other crypto projects.
