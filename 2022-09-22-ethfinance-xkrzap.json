Metrics are deep fried oversold and we've got daily bullish divergences on growth indices QQQ tech and IWM small caps, which are often leaders, as well as on the bond canaries. Our #1 canary HYG has only a class B div (equal lows) but we'll accept it. Reminder that divergences do NOT *have* to play out but they commonly do. If you are in SPY and DIA (S&P and Dow), note that they do not have bull divs -- just confluent lower lows.\n\nNow as I say this, the pump could very well be accompanied by a fresh dump first to about 374 (using SPY), where the options expected move for the week has a lower bound. That could be a touch on 374 and then up into the weekend. Or it could be a bounce off the close today and a further dip Friday. Don't know, doesn't matter. Targets on either side go like 374-378 - 382 - 385.50 - 388.60.\n\nCrypto is similarly oversold on short time frames. In terms of divergences, BTC has a bull div on the daily RSI. But because ETH was overall much stronger throughout September, its plunge removed any chance of a bull div printing this time. Additionally, BTC shorts are confirming a topping pattern and beginning to head down. As always, the derivative of a shorts chart is *volatility* not any guarantee of up or down. However, every top in shorts in 2022 YTD has marked a local bottom. Previously, shorts topped Dec 3, 2021 and that was obviously a break down so there are no guarantees just probability.\n\nETH, having sadly exited down through the summer channel bottom, will have it now act as resistance around 1310. Below 1225 again and it's dead air to about 1150.\n\nBTC, again being the weaker crypto this summer, has lower humps to clear on its retrace or bounce. Once it breaks back above 18950, there's room to move up to about 19.5k. Close below about 18,250 again though and it's straight to 17.5k.\n\nAnd for posterity, I'd mentioned I'd reignite a short with a close below 1250. Well I did NOT open a short position because the close was only 1245 and I like a little buffer room with my personal calls, 10% usually.\n\nHappy to respond to more questions about the FOMC but know I will have a more comprehensive take, either video or write-up, on the weekend.\n\ncheers, all","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Just some digestion posts until we get to a point I can do a deep dive into what exactly happened yesterday and why the game has changed for the next twelve months or so.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re licking our wounds, but the market is absolutely primed for a pump into the weekend at least. Metrics are deep fried oversold and we&#39;ve got daily bullish divergences on growth indices QQQ tech and IWM small caps, which are often leaders, as well as on the bond canaries. Our #1 canary HYG has only a class B div (equal lows) but we&#39;ll accept it. Reminder that divergences do NOT <em>have</em> to play out but they commonly do. If you are in SPY and DIA (S&amp;P and Dow), note that they do not have bull divs -- just confluent lower lows.</p>\n\n<p>Now as I say this, the pump could very well be accompanied by a fresh dump first to about 374 (using SPY), where the options expected move for the week has a lower bound. That could be a touch on 374 and then up into the weekend. Or it could be a bounce off the close today and a further dip Friday. Don&#39;t know, doesn&#39;t matter. Targets on either side go like 374-378 - 382 - 385.50 - 388.60.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto is similarly oversold on short time frames. In terms of divergences, BTC has a bull div on the daily RSI. But because ETH was overall much stronger throughout September, its plunge removed any chance of a bull div printing this time. Additionally, BTC shorts are confirming a topping pattern and beginning to head down. As always, the derivative of a shorts chart is <em>volatility</em> not any guarantee of up or down. However, every top in shorts in 2022 YTD has marked a local bottom. Previously, shorts topped Dec 3, 2021 and that was obviously a break down so there are no guarantees just probability.</p>\n\n<p>ETH, having sadly exited down through the summer channel bottom, will have it now act as resistance around 1310. Below 1225 again and it&#39;s dead air to about 1150.</p>\n\n<p>BTC, again being the weaker crypto this summer, has lower humps to clear on its retrace or bounce. Once it breaks back above 18950, there&#39;s room to move up to about 19.5k. Close below about 18,250 again though and it&#39;s straight to 17.5k.</p>\n\n<p>And for posterity, I&#39;d mentioned I&#39;d reignite a short with a close below 1250. Well I did NOT open a short position because the close was only 1245 and I like a little buffer room with my personal calls, 10% usually.</p>\n\n<p>Happy to respond to more questions about the FOMC but know I will have a more comprehensive take, either video or write-up, on the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>cheers, all</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-22 01:10:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ipfyred","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xkrzap","parent_id":"t3_xkrzap","score":51,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptomoon2020","body":"I have one question which I think is very pertinent.

That&#39;s typically due to shoe design where it comes to a round at tip of the shoe forcing your toes to crunch up. This goes against the normal foot formation where the toes are more splayed.</p>\n\n<p>These foot shaped shoes are more boxy at the tip allowing your toes to spread more naturally. Since then my toe pain has gone away, my toe has started to straighten out again, and some longer term issues with flat feet have been improving (wider toe stance helps support the arch).</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, if you&#39;re into foot health even if you don&#39;t have any foot pain I&#39;d recommend checking these types of shoes out. If interested Vivobarefoot is one brand that offers this type of shoes and there&#39;s a collection of some other brand/models <a href=\"https://correcttoes.com/shop/shoes.html\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-22 08:30:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ipha4iz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xkrzap","parent_id":"t1_iph8qnh","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"I have a big bunion forming on my left foot, this is amazing","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have a big bunion forming on my left foot, this is amazing</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-22 08:47:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iphcvts","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xkrzap","parent_id":"t1_ipha4iz","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"Couple it with toe spacers.
