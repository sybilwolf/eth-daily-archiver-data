The stock markets were booming so crypto was completely detached, there was finally some interesting and valuable dapps being built (DeFi), there was also finally a viable scaling solution emerging (rollups), there was finally a testnet for the beacon chain around this time IIRC, but most importantly, with proof-of-stake and EIP-1559, ETH finally being improved as a decent monetary asset. There had been tremendous progress since December 2018 bottom, way more than the \\~40% reflected in price. Sub-$10 in 2016 was way higher risk, no one knew if this stuff was anything more than an experiment. March 2020 was an anomalous event, with good reason for panic as the global economy shut down indefinitely, Dec 2019 was definitely an \"easier\" buy even at a higher price. \n\nThat brings me to June 2022 and Sep 2022, which feels almost as good as Dec 2019. Obviously, the reward factor is going to be much lower now, but the risk also the lowest it has ever been - since Dec 2019 we have seen viable product-market fit established for DeFi and NFTs, viable scaling solutions prove themselves, and finally, proof-of-stake ship - all the promises from then have now been delivered.

Like many, I freaked out a bit when it became clearer and clearer just how big of a stake percentage a small handful of staking services would have and what that would mean about their control over the network. But I think I understand now that we have to adjust our view on this topic due to the fundamental differences between PoW and Ethereum-PoS. This might be old news to most here but maybe it helps some, so bear with me.\n\n\nThe security of a blockchain is, on a basic level, tied to two different attributes: *resistance* and *resilience* against attacks.\n\n\n*Resistance* means that it is so difficult to attack the chain that the scenario will likely never play out.\n\n\n*Resilience* means that the network can recover without too much damage after an attack has occured.\n\n\nThe entire industry so far was laser-focused on the former and didn't care much about the latter. And the reason for this is simple: PoW is all *resistance* and zero *resilience*. If a PoW chain is attacked, there is basically nothing that can be done to recover. The only possibility is forking the chain and changing the hashing algorithm, which is a futile attempt knowing someone out there had enough resources to overtake the network previously and likely still has enough at their disposal to shift towards whatever equipment the forked chain requires. So the *only* choice a PoW blockchain has to secure the network is to prevent an attack from ever occuring in the first place.\n\n\nThis might get me some downvotes but with the move to PoS, Ethereum has made it significantly easier to be attacked. Its block production became more centralized and the chain therefore less *resistant*. That is an unfortunate truth we have to accept. But does this actually make Ethereum less secure? \n\n\nNo. Actually, the opposite happened. All thanks to this neat little mechanism called *slashing*, which increased the *resiliance* by an immeasurable amount. If Ethereum is ever attacked, no matter how large the attacker's validator share, the remaining network can always fork the chain and immediately punish the attacker by removing all their staked ETH. And since an attack that requires such measures would be very obvious, it is easy for the honest share of validators to recognize which chain is the \"true\" Ethereum. This process can be repeated and always leaves the attacker with losing the *entire* stake. All the network would really suffer is damage to its image.\n\n\nThe almost ironic beauty of this high *resilience* is that it is such a strong deterrant to malicious actors that it increases the effective *resistance* against attacks.\n\n\nSo in the end, Ethereum has taken a compromise: lower decentralization of block production in order to vastly increase *resilience* and arguably *resistance* against attacks. Security is higher than ever under PoS and the chain has lost none of its credible neutrality in the process.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this is harder to grasp than looking at a comparison list of Nakamoto coefficients. So it is our task to educate people. Don't handwave away the decentralization question but explain what the change actually means for Ethereum.
