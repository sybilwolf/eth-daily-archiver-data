The block builder bribed the proposing validator into censoring all the transactions by offering a bigger bribe than the proposer would have gotten through that block's MEV+tips. The concern is if this could be turned into a more serious DOS attack.

[This Vitalik post](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance) talks about censorship, and pretty much comes to the same conclusion I did about the reduced cost of censorship. It also mentions possible solutions, including one I hope most here have at least heard in passing...\n\nCrLists (CR is for \"censorship resistance\") are the most likely answer at this point. There's [a good explanation here](https://notes.ethereum.org/@fradamt/H1ZqdtrBF) and [thoughts on implementation here](https://notes.ethereum.org/@fradamt/H1TsYRfJc#Incentivization) and it's also covered in the lovely [Hitchhiker's Guide to Ethereum](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum/). But very briefly: when validators propose a block, they also publish a crList to the p2p network, which is a list of valid transactions currently in the mempool. After some amount of time to ensure that the crList has propagated around the network, block builders *have to* include those transactions in their block. If a block builder had sufficient notice of the crList but does not include all valid transactions when the block isn't yet full, then attesters will refuse to vote for that block.\n\nThis means that we can still outsource block production to dedicated block builders (so validators don't face that centralization risk), but the validators can force transactions to be included, preventing censorship.\n\nNow that we've seen a very obvious example of builder censorship in practice with this empty block (though I'm sure it's been happening to some degree for months), this should be a wake-up call that mev-boost and its form of PBS is already here and already very popular. Until we have crLists, we are at a higher risk of transaction censorship.

This can be shown from the monetary price model that basically calculates the price equilibrium at which burn and issuance cancel each other. Which, given certain network revenues, is a stable price equilibrium and it doesn't require any buy or sell pressure to sustain. At the risk of rehashing it too much but is important to understand what this means, we are sitting at prices that do not require net buying pressure to be sustained.

Let me explain, the above argument holds true under equilibrium, that is, a market situation that has stabilized and is seeing stable inflows-outflows. But is not true when the equilibrium breaks. And the merge has broken the equilibrium. We still don't see it, it's too early. Remember how the central banks printed 40% of the money in existence in 2020 yet inflation only showed its ugly face in mid 2021 and we are still undergoing it? Yep, supply imbalance took time to show up. Going by history, Bitcoin halvings take at a minimum 2 months a half and play out during the next 1.5-2 years after. It's not that hard to understand either, mining pools are still sitting on their pile of cash. They still have to issue payments of whatever last few weeks, months. This trickles down slowly, for a few weeks after the merge their sell pressure is the same. A bit later starts to dry up progressively and in the span of a few months it dries out and this causes the imbalance. \n\nWhen there is imbalance the above argument about price equilibrium doesn't work as reflexivity kicks in and reflexivity is inherently a non-linear effect (in math/physics this is called a positive feedback loop but Soros gave it the name of reflexivity in financial contexts and it stuck). In case it's not clear the monetary price model described above that compares issuance and burn is a linear model. Here is how reflexivity fucks things up. You start with a supply-demand imbalance, in our case a supply crunch. Whatever demand is there cannot find initially enough ETH to buy which pushes prices slightly higher, think of this as bumping a ball that was in equilibrium and starts rolling. Price increases cause some traders to pile into the trade, causing a greater imbalance, this is why momentum strategies work. At the same time price increases cause more network activity, all of DeFi start to light up, more trading goes on which increases fees which implies higher ETH price valuations. As prices start to move up in DeFi exchanges, there is more arbitrage as you need to rebalance all prices between exchanges, more activity and more MEV. Higher Yield for validators, higher implied valuation for ETH. It's a flywheel that keeps feeding itself. This is the essence of reflexivity. And... a lot of this is native ETH economy, most of DeFi is implicitly priced in ETH which means that the increase of ETH price doesn't hurt the network fee because ETH-native activity is willing to pay 20 GWei at whatever price of ETH. Again, more fee revenues in USD implies higher valuations.\n\nThis positive feedback loop or reflexivity can go for quite a while.

Exactly why do blockchains *need* to generate fees to generate value? \n\n>A lot of Ethereum price is driven by speculation right now, and in order to sustain these levels and go higher in the future, there needs to be real demand for ETH.\n\nA lot of Ethereum price is driven by real demand right now, and I'm sure there'll be even more demand in the future. The biggest demand so far has been as a currency to invest in projects and for trading, why do you think that will/has to change to be dominated by network fees? Trading and exchanging value is a real demand, ENS is a real demand, NFTs are real demand (albeit difficult for some to understand), L2 activity and TVL is a real demand, staking is real demand, etc. The older and larger the network grows, the more application and use cases it will have that is creating real demand for ETH.

Sorry I write too much, always ends up long...\n\n----\n\nWhen a validator gets an opportunity to propose a block, traditionally they're incentivized to put in as many transactions as possible. Every tx is going to pay some amount as a tip, so any leftover block space is a wasted opportunity to put in more transactions and get more tips. If you want to DOS the network, you have to submit transactions to fill up the blocks, paying high enough priority fees on all of them to prevent legitimate transactions from getting included. That's expensive!\n\nWith mev-boost, instead of a validator building their own blocks, they connect to a number of relays which connect to block builders who try to build maximally profitable blocks. Dedicated block builders get a competitive edge by looking for MEV opportunities and running private mempools for people trying to avoid getting attacked by MEV. When a validator running mev-boost gets a block proposal, they ask all their connected relays for their most profitable blocks, then take the one that pays them the most and proposes it.\n\nTwitter user @SeigeRhino2 describes (and I don't know the details here) that Flashbots has a \"trust agreement\" that validators cannot unravel blocks. If an mev-boost validator accepts a block from the Flashbots relay, they must propose that block as is. They cannot add more transactions or reorder them or anything. This sounds reasonable in general: the blocks they receive should generally be pretty well optimized.\n\nSome ballpark numbers I've seen are that a regular block of regular transactions would earn a validator about 0.03 ETH in tips, and that a regular mev-boost block would bring that up to 0.04 ETH. **Here's the attack:** An attacker can build a block consisting of one single transaction in which they pay the proposing validator 0.05 ETH. The rest of the block is empty. This is a higher reward than all the other relays would find, so the validator would accept it and publish it to the network. Under the Flashbots trust agreement, the validator cannot use up the rest of that block space. The block *would have been* more profitable to both the block building attacker and the proposing validator if it contained both the 0.05 ETH bribe and a whole block's worth of regular transactions, but the attacker is deliberately foregoing that profit in order to attack the network.\n\n----\n\nUnder the traditional block-building scheme, an attacker would have to cover the base fee and priority fee for enough transactions to prevent other txs from getting through. Looking at a [recent block near the gas target](https://etherscan.io/block/15604200), that would be at least 0.15 ETH, likely much more ([0.24 ETH](https://etherscan.io/block/15604202)?) since they'd have to really fill it up. Full blocks means EIP-1559 adjusts the base fee upwards, costing the attacker more. Legitimate users who pay a high enough priority fee can still \"break through\" the attack to get included, which may force the attacker to pay even more to ensure a total lockout. ETH holders and block proposing validators celebrate the burn and high tips, and go to their local Japanese restaurant to splurge on *fancy* ramen, but network users struggle.\n\nUnder the mev-boost scheme, the attacker only has to pay the base fee for one transaction, in which they pay a bribe (~0.05 ETH) that surpasses the combined value of MEV+tips that would otherwise find its way into the block. Legitimate users can only break through the attack by collectively paying enough in tips to make their legit block more valuable than the attacker's bribe. Individual transactions have a harder time breaking through, and it's possible for the attacker to include just one or two legitimate high-priority-fee txs or MEV sandwiches in their DOS block to make it much more difficult to be outbid. Regular users will end up increasing their tips to try to get in, and the attacker will have to increase the bribe to compensate as before, but not having to pay a whole block's worth of base fee cuts the cost down significantly. The network is unusable and there's not even any burn to make hodlers happy, but the validators earn 0.01 extra ETH per block, so under mev-boost's logic they'll keep up the attack.\n\nUnder the traditional scheme, a block proposer has the option to propose an empty block, but it hurts them (no fee revenue) and can't reliably attack the network unless you run all the validators. Under mev-boost with a no-unraveling trust agreement, an attacker can DOS the network more cheaply (I'm going to say at least an order of magnitude cheaper), doesn't have to have staked ETH in a validator, and can carry out the attack on every block proposed by a mev-boost-enabled validator connected to a no-unraveling relay.\n\nI have a few questions myself. I've just learned about relay trust agreements today; do all relays not allow filling unused block space, or just Flashbots? mev-boost is new to me as a validator, but this same attack should have existed during the PoW days; is this attack actually new, or have miners been aware of it? What sort of countermeasures are available? A L0 change in when unraveling is okay, or what kinds of unraveling can be done?\n\nAny corrections or further discussion would be greatly appreciated.\n\n----\n\nOkay sorry sorry **tl;dr:** Validators could always propose empty blocks, but it only hurt themselves and was hard to make a sustained attack. A \"no-unraveling trust agreement\" present in some (all?) mev-boost relays means that block proposers can be *bribed* to create empty blocks. The bribe has to be worth more than the sum of MEV+tips in a regular block, so around 0.05 ETH / block currently. I'm roughly guessing that a traditional DOS attack by buying out all block space would start at 0.24 ETH / block (at today's bear market gas prices) and increase rapidly as EIP-1559 adjusts the base fee upwards, making this attack 5x cheaper to start and likely 10-30x cheaper over a significant duration.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m going to try rephrasing it, see if I can clarify at all.

The network is unusable and there&#39;s not even any burn to make hodlers happy, but the validators earn 0.01 extra ETH per block, so under mev-boost&#39;s logic they&#39;ll keep up the attack.</p>\n\n<p>Under the traditional scheme, a block proposer has the option to propose an empty block, but it hurts them (no fee revenue) and can&#39;t reliably attack the network unless you run all the validators. Under mev-boost with a no-unraveling trust agreement, an attacker can DOS the network more cheaply (I&#39;m going to say at least an order of magnitude cheaper), doesn&#39;t have to have staked ETH in a validator, and can carry out the attack on every block proposed by a mev-boost-enabled validator connected to a no-unraveling relay.</p>\n\n<p>I have a few questions myself. I&#39;ve just learned about relay trust agreements today; do all relays not allow filling unused block space, or just Flashbots? mev-boost is new to me as a validator, but this same attack should have existed during the PoW days; is this attack actually new, or have miners been aware of it? What sort of countermeasures are available? A L0 change in when unraveling is okay, or what kinds of unraveling can be done?</p>\n\n<p>Any corrections or further discussion would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Okay sorry sorry <strong>tl;dr:</strong> Validators could always propose empty blocks, but it only hurt themselves and was hard to make a sustained attack. A &quot;no-unraveling trust agreement&quot; present in some (all?) mev-boost relays means that block proposers can be <em>bribed</em> to create empty blocks. The bribe has to be worth more than the sum of MEV+tips in a regular block, so around 0.05 ETH / block currently. I&#39;m roughly guessing that a traditional DOS attack by buying out all block space would start at 0.24 ETH / block (at today&#39;s bear market gas prices) and increase rapidly as EIP-1559 adjusts the base fee upwards, making this attack 5x cheaper to start and likely 10-30x cheaper over a significant duration.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-24 09:36:19","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-09-24 09:48:12","id":"ipqf602","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xmjibe","parent_id":"t1_ippw759","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"This is very interesting thank you. \n\nOnly comment is that as far as I know all the current 5-6 relays use the same mev-relay software open sourced by Flashbots, so presumably if Flashbots relay has this trust assumption, then all do. \n\nIt makes sense anyway - the whole block/trust assumption thing has been there from the mev-geth days to prevent miners deconstructing blocks and taking the MEV for themselves (on pain of being kicked out of the Flashbots relay pre-Merge). \n\nLots to think about here.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is very interesting thank you. </p>\n\n<p>Only comment is that as far as I know all the current 5-6 relays use the same mev-relay software open sourced by Flashbots, so presumably if Flashbots relay has this trust assumption, then all do. </p>\n\n<p>It makes sense anyway - the whole block/trust assumption thing has been there from the mev-geth days to prevent miners deconstructing blocks and taking the MEV for themselves (on pain of being kicked out of the Flashbots relay pre-Merge). </p>\n\n<p>Lots to think about here.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-24 10:59:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ipqqxch","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xmjibe","parent_id":"t1_ipqf602","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"you actually crashed my browser wtf","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>you actually crashed my browser wtf</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-24 09:59:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ipqiflq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xmjibe","parent_id":"t1_ipqf602","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Il_Conte_","body":"I was about to start setting up MEV... should I wait then? since it poses a risk to the network..","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I was about to start setting up MEV... should I wait then? since it poses a risk to the network..</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-24 11:15:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ipqt8y5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xmjibe","parent_id":"t1_ipqf602","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"> can\u2019t this basically be used to DOS Ethereum at will?\n\nonly for as long as the relays let them.
