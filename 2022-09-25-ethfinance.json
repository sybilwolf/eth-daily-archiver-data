First you might look at the total volume across the space and see figures like there is $70B in total sales volume and think there's a lot of opportunity here. I think if you look at more recent numbers since the hype died though you'll come to a different conclusion. In short, I haven't seen a category of NFT hit adoption yet that I expect to bring in enough recurring trading revenue to pay the number of developers I see working in this ecosystem. I talk about 2 types of collection NFT\u2019s [here](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-future-gamification-of-nfts/) that I want to review the revenue potential of.\n\nThe first type are art collections. You know the type. When Snowden sells his 1 of 1 piece it has a high price tag and carries that price because of it's cultural significance. I'd equate this to the physical art market. Physical art sales have an average resale time of [about 25 years](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/our-firm/art/2022/all-about-nfts.html). The entire physical art market has about ~~$40M~~ [$65B](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/our-firm/art/collecting/art-market-survey.html#artmarketreport2022) in trading volume. The rate at which art sells is at least throttled by the creation speed of the artist and the number of artists is gated by the market demand for new art. These factors combined lead me to believe we aren\u2019t going to see a sustained 10x from this type of asset. So *maybe* NFT exchanges can sustain 100M in annual volume from this type of NFT.\n\nFrom a trading perspective you could also lump ENS into this category. ENS sales have been in a bull market recently and are included in these exchange statistics but while individual profits like /u/cash had recently are certainly noteworthy for individuals they just don't have the volume to be remarkable at the scale I'm talking about. I remember there being a land rush for DNS names in the .com bubble as well. I think that similarly to the physical art market, ENS names will have a very long average resale time and relatively low volumes. We're just living through the initial distribution phase of that collection.\n\nThe second type are community NFT's. These are your various Apes, Lions, Panda, Owls, etc. A lot of animals for some reason, strangely [Rokugan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Five_Rings)-esque. Now, in the last bull market these NFTs did shockingly well. I saw random Ape images on clothing stores in malls, celebrities were on board, discussion of this hit talk shows, etc. Consider that a success. There's some good dashboards of this [market segment](https://dune.com/cryptuschrist/Top-100-NFT-Projects?Time_e00b2f=1+Year&Top_ef3633=50). If you look at all time volumes they are astronomical (majority of that $70B) and surely they created a lot of revenue for the exchanges positioned to capture it. However, if you look at the volume since May it does paint a very different picture. More recent time scales indicate we're going to level off at about $2-$2.5B in volume. While that is much bigger than traditional art markets and I love to see it, it's still off by 5x what is needed to pay for development.\n\nSo how much is needed? Well, we want at least a few NFT exchanges to survive. Napkin math real quick, we probably need something on the order of 1000 people working in this sector. If the average salary is something like $100k (average of positions like community manager, support, and developers), we need $100M in exchange revenue. If the exchange capture rate on volume is 1% (LooksRare is 0.2%, OpenSea is 2.5%), we need a sustainable $10B in volume. This is obviously a lot of parameters that I'm only guessing at ballpark figures for but I just don't see those numbers happening from the types of NFT's we're seeing today. Put together, the values above bring us to ~2.5B in volume. Clearly, something more is needed and I'm going to propose a few more types of NFT's that may shore up this deficit.\n\nFirst, ticket sales. Ticketmaster's volume alone is about $8.9B per year. Even their final revenue of $1.4B dwarfs is impressive and that's just one company. Ticketmaster is basically just a middleman that charges ridiculous fees that hurts both the venue and attendees. It's a rather perfect opportunity for some Defi-mullet and we're [already](https://nbatopshot.com/nba-allstar-vip-pass) [seeing](https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-sell-nft-tickets-for-major-italian-soccer-club-lazio/) it start to happen [even from Ticketmaster themselves](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/31/ticketmaster-taps-the-flow-blockchain-to-let-event-organizers-issue-nfts-tied-to-tickets/). This is where things like Rarible's multi-chain protocol would really shine as it is fully indexed and is made to allow numerous frontends, dial their own parameters, and for people to pick whatever chain they want.\n\nSecond, gaming. Everything from expiring data licenses that allow for digital game rentals, game sales that could lower the fee taken by Steam, in game items (loot boxes, subscription items, vanity items), are good use cases for NFT's. Steam made [$6.4B](https://vginsights.com/steam-market-data) in gross revenue just from game sales in 2021. Given their 30% cut, that implies a volume of $21B. That doesn't include micro-transactions or other in-game purchases. Loot boxes alone account for another [$15B in sales](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-boxes-to-generate-usd20bn-by-2025) in 2020. Again, a huge market opportunity. If NFT exchanges can form the right partnerships and capture even 10% of this market segment, we're in business.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been looking at NFT exchange tokens recently and I want to share some thoughts about NFT revenue.

Put together, the values above bring us to ~2.5B in volume. Clearly, something more is needed and I&#39;m going to propose a few more types of NFT&#39;s that may shore up this deficit.</p>\n\n<p>First, ticket sales. Ticketmaster&#39;s volume alone is about $8.9B per year. Even their final revenue of $1.4B dwarfs is impressive and that&#39;s just one company. Ticketmaster is basically just a middleman that charges ridiculous fees that hurts both the venue and attendees. It&#39;s a rather perfect opportunity for some Defi-mullet and we&#39;re <a href=\"https://nbatopshot.com/nba-allstar-vip-pass\">already</a> <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-sell-nft-tickets-for-major-italian-soccer-club-lazio/\">seeing</a> it start to happen <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/31/ticketmaster-taps-the-flow-blockchain-to-let-event-organizers-issue-nfts-tied-to-tickets/\">even from Ticketmaster themselves</a>. This is where things like Rarible&#39;s multi-chain protocol would really shine as it is fully indexed and is made to allow numerous frontends, dial their own parameters, and for people to pick whatever chain they want.</p>\n\n<p>Second, gaming. Everything from expiring data licenses that allow for digital game rentals, game sales that could lower the fee taken by Steam, in game items (loot boxes, subscription items, vanity items), are good use cases for NFT&#39;s. Steam made <a href=\"https://vginsights.com/steam-market-data\">$6.4B</a> in gross revenue just from game sales in 2021. Given their 30% cut, that implies a volume of $21B. That doesn&#39;t include micro-transactions or other in-game purchases. Loot boxes alone account for another <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-boxes-to-generate-usd20bn-by-2025\">$15B in sales</a> in 2020. Again, a huge market opportunity. If NFT exchanges can form the right partnerships and capture even 10% of this market segment, we&#39;re in business.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-25 13:05:35","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-09-26 10:25:00","id":"ipvseol","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xndzwc","parent_id":"t3_xndzwc","score":36,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/italianjob16","body":"When trying to explain this in other subreddits I've been told Live Nation (ticketmaster's parent company) mostly own the venues they sell tickets for so they would never become an nft-ticketing customer.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>When trying to explain this in other subreddits I&#39;ve been told Live Nation (ticketmaster&#39;s parent company) mostly own the venues they sell tickets for so they would never become an nft-ticketing customer.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-25 13:23:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ipvvas1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xndzwc","parent_id":"t1_ipvseol","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"So, NFT's have a few technical advantages to traditional tickets.\n\n1) All secondary sales can be tracked.
