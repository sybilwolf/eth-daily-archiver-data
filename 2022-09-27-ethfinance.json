Thanks","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think to say an indefinite non-nuclear war has been priced in is a gigantic over-simplification. </p>\n\n<p>How do you even begin to price in an indefinite non-nuclear war between one of the biggest energy producers and one of the biggest food producers? When the entire world and various military and political alliances are all working to their respective agendas? It\u2019s too complex, far reaching and unpredictable. </p>\n\n<p>Even \u2018non-nuclear\u2019, seemingly the clearest line of your definition, is a somewhat blurred line that may move, given the wide variety of nuclear weaponry; smaller tactical nukes are unlikely to warrant the same response as larger ones, and do tests or shows of force over the ocean/underground count? It\u2019s already a nuclear war in so far as nukes are being used as strategic tools with which to make threats relating to specific military activity.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s way, way too complicated to be able to just say indefinite non-nuclear war is priced in, imho. Got a lot of time for your thoughts though, egg.
