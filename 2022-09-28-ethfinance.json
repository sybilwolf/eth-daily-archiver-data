You could hit zero proposals in a year, and then fees are meaningless. Or you could equally get lucky and hit 12 in a year, all of which hit blocks with big fees, and end up making an extra $50k. Over time, this will average, but it will take a <em>long</em> time. Also, over time, the fee distribution will vary, along with the probability of proposing a block. TL;DR As a solo staker it is very difficult to predict anything beyond the base rewards.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-28 09:35:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iq95m33","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xq3bqf","parent_id":"t1_iq940ra","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I appreciate this reply, this is exactly what I mean.\n\nYou are right, someone with a large amount of validators actually has a chance to calculate whether they will make anything in comparison to the risk.\n\nIn my book, one solo validator is *not* an investment.
