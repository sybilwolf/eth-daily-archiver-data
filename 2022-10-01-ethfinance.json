In particular, it doesn't require any changes to the underlying Ethereum protocol; it's a kind of an opt-in soft fork I suppose. Because MEV searching is such a centralizing force, there is incentive to build on top of Ethereum to make a way to outsource block production to specialized builders. And thus, mev-boost. And to some extent, it works! Validators get higher rewards and all have access to the same relays.\n\nIt would be nice if we could solve the builder censorship issue using more coordination and tools outside the protocol to reduce complexity. But it sounds like in-protocol PBS has the advantage of being able to directly punish bad behavior through slashing and attestation rules.

It's questionable whether the yield farming rates for FPI/FRAX offset the opportunity cost of just holding straight FPI. I do some of both.\n\nMIM3CRV has been over 10% most of the year. Same with MIM2CRV on Arbitrum. On Concentrator the MIM pool is at 12% + extra CTR rewards. It's basically just DAI with extra drama I get paid for.\n\nThere's a newer MAI pool on Aura that's in the 8% range but I need to evaluate the cross-chain risks of MAI before I'm hopping in there.\n\nThere are CEX options. Nexo has been at 10% all year for me, though I can't deposit more there because the SEC is \"protecting me\". Blockfi is at 7.5% that you can balance 20k lumps across several stablecoins for. The insolvency risk there has passed but again, same SEC restrictions.\n\nalUSD/USDC on Velodrome is over 7%. sUSD is at 6.7%. alUSD has some peg risk associated with it. sUSD has the more complicated Synthetix ecosystem attached to it you should understand before you invest.\n\nIf you're going to be holding a mix of ETH and stable anyway GLP is about 2/3 1/3 but gives you over 20% APR on the entire basket which has been phenomenal.
