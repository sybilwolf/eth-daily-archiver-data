In their [own words](https://docs.looksrare.org/blog/the-nft-marketplace)\n\n> \u201cLooksRare is the community-first NFT marketplace that actively rewards traders, collectors and creators for participating.\u201d\n\nThe way this statement is put into practice is with a much higher than average percentage of the issuance being given to marketplace participants. This incentivization continues beyond the airdrop to staking and usage rewards for the first two years.\n\n[Here's](https://docs.looksrare.org/about/looks-tokenomics) a brief table of their issuance:\n\n| Category             | Day 0 | Final Total |\n|----------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Treasury             | 0     | 100M        |\n| Team                 | 0     | 100M        |\n| LOOKS Staking        | 0     | 189M        |\n| Volume Rewards       | 0     | 441M        |\n| Liquidity Management | 17M   | 17M         |\n| Strategic Sale       | 33M   | 33M         |\n| Airdrop              | 120M  | 120M        |\n\n\nIt is not uncommon in this industry to see the team and investors keep 30-50% of the issuance and a separate allocation for a community managed treasury that often ends up being fully controlled by the team and investors because of the size of their allocation, easy coordination amongst fewer participants, and low voting participation amongst the community holders. By contrast, LooksRare has only given 13.3% of the tokens to the founding team and investors and 100M of those tokens vest continuously with the community. It\u2019s much harder to control a vote outright with 13.3% of the share and as a result this is the healthiest distribution of the NFT exchange tokens I have reviewed.\n\nThe allocation isn\u2019t even frontloaded for initial control. At initial launch the token supply is dominated by the airdrop and by the end of the first year token supply is dominated by traders and stakers. Their inflation schedule is running for 2 years with almost a third of that dropping in the first month. They launched January 10th 2022.\n\nLet\u2019s go over these categories. They have three types of liquidity mining.\n\n1) [Staking](https://looksrare.org/rewards)\n\n2) [Listing](https://docs.looksrare.org/blog/looksrare-listing-rewards-list-nfts-earn-looks) (Profits from limit order sales)\n\n3) [Trading](https://docs.looksrare.org/about/rewards/trading-rewards) (Profit from market orders)\n\n4) There was also a Pool-2 LM program but it was [discontinued](https://docs.looksrare.org/blog/looks-emission-phase-2#changes-to-lp-staking-rewards) and replaced with a team-run alternative. This was the Liquidity Management issuance. Basically it looks like they took their excess ecosystem dev fund wETH rewards, paired them with the leftover LOOKS from the liquidity management rewards and made their own Pool-2.\n\nIn the final year there will be another 200M tokens issued. I'll be using that rate for PE calculations. At $0.2 a token that\u2019s an issuance cost of $40M. How does this compare to their sustainable revenue? Well, first we need to understand their revenue model. LooksRare collects a 2% [platform fee](https://docs.looksrare.org/about/rewards/platform-fee). 100% of these fees go to LOOKS stakers. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the entire revenue stream. So, let\u2019s go calculate some volume!\n\nI\u2019m going to estimate the sustainable volume by removing the wash volume following the approach from [this dashboard](https://dune.com/hildobby/LooksRare-Wash-Trades-Filtering). There\u2019s going to be no wash volume once the issuance is gone so this seems like a reasonable baseline. This just removes trades where the NFT moves back and forth between two addresses. It\u2019s crude but watch how much volume this removes.\n\nThe total cumulative volume is $26.739B but the total non-wash trade volume is $1.682B. This gives us a wash trading ratio of 93.7% since inception. Since the trading fee is 2% this gives us a total non-wash trading revenue of $33.65M YTD. Normalized to 365 days this gives us a projected sustainable revenue of $46.88M which shockingly comes out ahead of their projected issuance as of next year by $6.88M.\n\nA more recent estimation of non-wash volume is a little less optimistic. Total non-wash volume since May 13\u2019th (where the chart sharply plummets) is $215.33M. Normalized to a year is $557.41M for a revenue of $11.15M. The difference is basically the bear market. Trading volumes across the board have roughly 1/4'd and what volume is left has shifted to OpenSea and MagicEden.\n\nSo whether you consider this a decent investment is mostly determined by whether you think the NFT volumes from the start of this year will be a representative average of volumes in future years. If the token price holds their market cap will be $160M by the time of the next inflation adjustment. In which case a post-issuance revenue of $6.883M gives you a PE of ~23 or closer to 20 if you adjust for their staking participation of [81.5%](https://dune.com/hildobby/LOOKS). That puts this on par with the NASDAQ if you put faith in the volume estimate. The lower bound estimate instead says the protocol is in debt about $30M a year. Either way, at this point in a bear market I'm not a buyer unless you're closer to PE 10 and adoption is trending *up*.\n\nFrom a market segment perspective LooksRare is optimized for community based NFT\u2019s and collections like ENS. These certainly dominate their volume metrics and their GUI layout. This makes them more direct competitors with OpenSea, and revenue aligned with the current NFT market. Their value proposition is lower fees (2% compared to 2.5%), sovereign contract ownership powered by [Manifest](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-studio), community ownership via LOOKS, and [community engagement](https://docs.looksrare.org/blog/community-advisor-program).\n\nWhat I do find somewhat concerning is the short duration of the issuance. They only have 2 years to bootstrap a revenue engine to continue to pay developers and hosting costs from that 10% ecosystem development allocation. Since the dev fund has 10% of the tokens, it receives 0.2% of all the revenue. They have to pay everyone from their community managers to their developers from this 0.2%. Let\u2019s say they have $10M in recurring costs. Not unreasonable for a venture of this scale with 34 employees. They would need $10M/0.002=$5B in recurring volume. Compared to the lower bound estimate of $500M in volume, they have a ways to go yet. I also wonder how well they will retain their market share once the issuance dips again in January or concludes the following year. Personally I think it\u2019s more aligned with their ethos to have a perpetual issuance strategy more similar to CRV.\n\nA note on wash trading. Ironically wash trading ended up being a sort of convoluted ICO and marketing push. As I calculated above, wash trading accounts for 93.7% of their volume to date. This implies wash traders paid about 175k wETH in fees competing for their share of the first 600k LOOKS. This means those wash traders paid an average ETH ratio of 0.00031127712 which is about double today\u2019s LOOKS/ETH ratio. Additionally it means the dev fund warchest earned about 17.5k ETH from them. At today\u2019s ETH value that\u2019s still over $22M in funds raised which should give them some runway. I can\u2019t even fault them, it\u2019s kind of brilliant.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Continuing on my NFT exchange <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xi2eus/daily_general_discussion_september_19_2022/ip16xwz/?context=3\">saga</a> today I&#39;m looking at LooksRare.

As far as I see in all your example transactions the difference is about 20'000 to 25'000 gas between the lowest and highest gas usage. This can normally be explained by the 'SSTORE' opcode. This opcode is invoked when one changes an existing value, store a new value or delete a value on chain in a smart contract. This opcode thus allows to store/change the amount of tokens you own in a smart contract. \n\nThe exact cost changes depending on inital and final state. If at the beginning the receiving address has no tokens it cost over 20'000 gas to reserve the space to store the value of the newly owned tokens. If you own tokens at the beginning but none at the end, the space to store the token values is freed and you get a gas refund. The size of that refund is capped by 1/5th of the total size of the transaction and some other limits.
