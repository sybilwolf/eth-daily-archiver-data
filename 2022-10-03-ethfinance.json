I ended up writing a lengthy response with my understanding of the centralizing forces MEV can bring to block production. I thought I'd copy it here in hopes that anyone could bring additional corrections or context.\n\nThe post is as follows:\n\n----\n\nThere's some important background information and context that I left out in my post. I can try to clarify a little.\n\nUnder the Ethereum protocol, all validators are equal: they require the same 32 ETH deposit, produce the same expected rate of return, and all their attestations are weighted the same.\n\nThe problem is with MEV. Whoever gets to propose a block also gets to decide which transactions get included and in what order. MEV is the capture of additional revenue by taking advantage of that ability. The most basic form of MEV is probably arbitrage, which is something anyone can theoretically take advantage of for profit, but building a block means you can secure that for yourself without having to worry about waiting for your transaction to be included.\n\nMore advanced forms of MEV involve sandwiching and frontrunning, which *require* being able to choose the order of transactions. They're also kind of controversial in that they're blatantly extracting value from regular users' transactions. This opens up a few means by which validators can become unequal, with some earning more than others.\n\n----\n\nFirst, identifying maximally profitable MEV strategies is not easy. It requires rapidly simulating many different possible transaction orderings and insertions, using complex algorithms whose developers would probably like to keep proprietary. So those with 1) more computational power and 2) better MEV algorithms can make more profit, providing a centralizing influence.\n\nSecond, regular users may want to avoid submitting their transactions to the public mempool to avoid getting value extracted/stolen by MEV-seeking block builders. To do this, they establish private agreements with block builders to include their transactions without extracting value from them. So centralizing point 3) is having access to private mempools.\n\nIf 1), 2), and 3) become too influential, then your average validator may become uncompetitive and forced to exit, leaving only a handful of centralized nodes running the network. There are solutions, most notably proposer-builder separation (PBS) (as currently seen in Flashbots' mev-boost); the Vitalik post I linked is about continuing to design better PBS systems. As a final note before anyone gets the wrong idea, MEV isn't an Ethereum-specific problem, but Ethereum's high usage and thriving DeFi space means there are more opportunities for MEV here than elsewhere.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This morning, <a href=\"/u/NonceSenses\">/u/NonceSenses</a> replied to a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xsmkzv/daily_general_discussion_october_1_2022/iqo2ob4/\">daily comment</a> I made a few days ago, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xsmkzv/daily_general_discussion_october_1_2022/iqwyar4/?context=1000\">looking for some clarification</a>.
