This is one of the truly Defi-native innovations like Alchemix that I find mind-blowing. I'd like to see more discussion about what's next in Defi here.\n\nPossibilities:\n\n1) Go 3x long ETH/USDC and put the resulting 3x ETH you bought into Yearn or another interest bearing position. The trade itself can be executed on an exchange of your choice, the result can be deposited into a protocol of your choice. This eliminates the need for dydx and is more capital efficient to users and can actually make a position like an Alchemix self-repaying loan depending on the borrow rate vs the yield rate for the components you chose.\n\n2) This same idea can be used to arbitrage depegs in LSD's with leverage using arbitrary collateral so long as you can find a place to borrow the denominator pair e.g. ETH in rETH/ETH. Practically this means Aave doesn't have to add an rETH collateral to do what I describe [here](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harvesting-interest-rate-spreads). In addition to just *being* 3x long stETH/ETH you can also deposit that stETH into something like Euler for even more yield.\n\n3) Leveraged farming with Curve LP's on something like Convex. 2.88% borrow rate on Aave for USDC is perfect for leveraged farming alUSD/FraxBP at 5.69%. Go at it for 7x leverage and make 19.67% yield with the only risk being if the underlying Curve LP token loses value or the Aave borrow rate goes higher than the Concentrator yield rate. This will drive up stablecoin lending rates on Aave to something fairer than 3%.\n\nIt's a damn shame seeing Defi money make less yield than the Fed rate and this is going to do something about that.
