I contend that it is the latter, and this is the situation we find ourselves in today. Some miners/validators choose not to include certain transactions, but they still participate in consensus normally because anything else would amount to an attack on the chain. \n\nETH PoS specifically confuses this further because [not all validators vote on any one slot](https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/committees) (block) during an epoch. Only a subcommittee of validators vote for a given slot during an epoch, and it is not known in advance which committee a validator may belong to. Thus a validator may be assigned a \"good\" slot in the same epoch as a \"bad\" slot, yet if they attest to this \"good\" slot they are also confirming the entire epoch which contains a \"bad\" slot. In this scenario a large validator pool may find itself refusing to attest to a \"bad\" slot yet still overwhelmingly voting to confirm the epoch it's in. Likewise, there isn't really a way to know in advance which transactions a future slot will hold, so if a \"bad\" transaction is in the very last block of a slot but the pool is underweight in the last slot's committee, the pool will still have voted overwhelmingly in favor of including it in the chain. \n\nSo if a pool can find itself unwittingly attesting to \"bad\" epochs, the only option is to attempt chain reorgs or they will inevitably be voting to confirm further \"bad\" slots. In the end, it's exactly the same as PoW- you have to perform chain reorgs if you want to truly perform this kind of censorship. \n\nThe TL;DR of all this is that censorship by attestation refusal isn't something I think we need to worry about at this point in time.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>But attesting to later blocks also confirms and finalizes the &quot;bad&quot; block in question. In either case by continuing to participate in &quot;normal&quot; consensus operations, you are legitimizing the &quot;bad&quot; block even if you didn&#39;t create it yourself. </p>\n\n<p>Is the goal of this censorship to prevent <em>any</em> &quot;bad&quot; blocks from entering the chain or is it simply to avoid adding &quot;bad&quot; transactions yourself? I contend that it is the latter, and this is the situation we find ourselves in today. Some miners/validators choose not to include certain transactions, but they still participate in consensus normally because anything else would amount to an attack on the chain. </p>\n\n<p>ETH PoS specifically confuses this further because <a href=\"https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/committees\">not all validators vote on any one slot</a> (block) during an epoch. Only a subcommittee of validators vote for a given slot during an epoch, and it is not known in advance which committee a validator may belong to. Thus a validator may be assigned a &quot;good&quot; slot in the same epoch as a &quot;bad&quot; slot, yet if they attest to this &quot;good&quot; slot they are also confirming the entire epoch which contains a &quot;bad&quot; slot. In this scenario a large validator pool may find itself refusing to attest to a &quot;bad&quot; slot yet still overwhelmingly voting to confirm the epoch it&#39;s in. Likewise, there isn&#39;t really a way to know in advance which transactions a future slot will hold, so if a &quot;bad&quot; transaction is in the very last block of a slot but the pool is underweight in the last slot&#39;s committee, the pool will still have voted overwhelmingly in favor of including it in the chain. </p>\n\n<p>So if a pool can find itself unwittingly attesting to &quot;bad&quot; epochs, the only option is to attempt chain reorgs or they will inevitably be voting to confirm further &quot;bad&quot; slots. In the end, it&#39;s exactly the same as PoW- you have to perform chain reorgs if you want to truly perform this kind of censorship. </p>\n\n<p>The TL;DR of all this is that censorship by attestation refusal isn&#39;t something I think we need to worry about at this point in time.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-05 07:00:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ir5fvez","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xw16ga","parent_id":"t1_ir5a8rw","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/aaj094","body":"This is a good perspective and hopefully the regulators see the futility of trying to impose local censorship rules in the matter of blockchain consensus participation. \n\nFrom the perspective of regulators, there ought to be other more sensible ways of imposing restrictions on sanctioned addresses and tinkering in blockchain consensus process should not be it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is a good perspective and hopefully the regulators see the futility of trying to impose local censorship rules in the matter of blockchain consensus participation. </p>\n\n<p>From the perspective of regulators, there ought to be other more sensible ways of imposing restrictions on sanctioned addresses and tinkering in blockchain consensus process should not be it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-05 07:05:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ir5glok","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xw16ga","parent_id":"t1_ir5fvez","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/aaj094","body":">ETH PoS specifically confuses this further because not all validators vote on any one slot  (block) during an epoch.
