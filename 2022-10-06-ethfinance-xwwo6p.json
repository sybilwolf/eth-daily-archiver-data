Anyone can hop on the Midjourney discord and plug in a text prompt and get good results within just a few minutes.\n\nAs a result, you can find AI-generated artwork everywhere around the internet now. There are some legitimate considerations to be made, e.g. how to credit this art (\"u/austonst via Midjourney?\" Is it even really fair for me to take any credit?) and to what extent AI assistance should be permitted in communities and spaces occupied by traditional artists. What we *don't want* is to have, let's say, a [vtuber's art tag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23artsofashes) flooded with a [billion low effort AI images](https://twitter.com/takanashikiara/status/1577727889289744409?s=20&t=lQdh4dFxj_Euk59aef2-lw) drowning out the stuff people put actual effort into. Fair concern.\n\nOf course, the Internet being what it is, [nuance is frequently neglected](https://twitter.com/martchelab/status/1577728438546599936?s=20&t=HF__15v_ImOGiW9W2i0UDg). Here's what I'm seeing: there's a growing and very vocal group of people who have caught onto the sound bite that AI-generated art is theft from the artists the AI was trained on, and that the resulting art will put the original artists out of business. That the researchers and programmers behind these models have committed some serious ethical violation in releasing this tech publicly. And as this idea is gaining momentum, I've seen folks on Reddit repeat the extreme claims for hundreds of upvotes and anyone who argues otherwise get hundreds of downvotes.\n\nAnd of course this sounds strikingly similar to the discussion around NFTs. Some AI-art/NFTs are theft/scams, therefore the whole space is theft/scams. Emphasizing one use case (posting AI art and saying \"I made this\" / PFP NFTs) without recognizing good uses (AI-as-a-tool/utility-NFTs). Spreading catchy viral \"technical explanations\" that are blatantly wrong but hard to correct. Blaming the developers of open, accessible, neutral technology for the actions of a few users.\n\nI don't have any wise words about how to change the narratives or whatever other than to reiterate that social media suuuuuucks. It also seems particularly unfortunate to me that there's such negative backlash specifically to technologies that are open, accessible, democratized, neutral. Anyone can use NFTs for any purpose! And anyone can use AI art for any purpose! And these folks portray that as a bad thing.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve seen an interesting Internet trend recently with some interesting parallels to crypto.</p>\n\n<p>AI-generated artwork (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc) has made a massive leap forward, with the critical factor being the <em>combination</em> of being pretty dang good and being easily accessible to anyone who wants to use it.

What we <em>don&#39;t want</em> is to have, let&#39;s say, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23artsofashes\">vtuber&#39;s art tag on Twitter</a> flooded with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/takanashikiara/status/1577727889289744409?s=20&amp;t=lQdh4dFxj_Euk59aef2-lw\">billion low effort AI images</a> drowning out the stuff people put actual effort into. Fair concern.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the Internet being what it is, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martchelab/status/1577728438546599936?s=20&amp;t=HF__15v_ImOGiW9W2i0UDg\">nuance is frequently neglected</a>. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing: there&#39;s a growing and very vocal group of people who have caught onto the sound bite that AI-generated art is theft from the artists the AI was trained on, and that the resulting art will put the original artists out of business. That the researchers and programmers behind these models have committed some serious ethical violation in releasing this tech publicly. And as this idea is gaining momentum, I&#39;ve seen folks on Reddit repeat the extreme claims for hundreds of upvotes and anyone who argues otherwise get hundreds of downvotes.</p>\n\n<p>And of course this sounds strikingly similar to the discussion around NFTs. Some AI-art/NFTs are theft/scams, therefore the whole space is theft/scams. Emphasizing one use case (posting AI art and saying &quot;I made this&quot; / PFP NFTs) without recognizing good uses (AI-as-a-tool/utility-NFTs). Spreading catchy viral &quot;technical explanations&quot; that are blatantly wrong but hard to correct. Blaming the developers of open, accessible, neutral technology for the actions of a few users.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t have any wise words about how to change the narratives or whatever other than to reiterate that social media suuuuuucks. It also seems particularly unfortunate to me that there&#39;s such negative backlash specifically to technologies that are open, accessible, democratized, neutral. Anyone can use NFTs for any purpose! And anyone can use AI art for any purpose! And these folks portray that as a bad thing.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-06 11:45:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"irbcds1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xwwo6p","parent_id":"t3_xwwo6p","score":35,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheHighFlyer","body":"There's definitely a trend that some parts of society are overwhelmed and afraid of all the posibilities and wish for more stringent and strict rules.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There&#39;s definitely a trend that some parts of society are overwhelmed and afraid of all the posibilities and wish for more stringent and strict rules.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-06 12:14:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"irbgpex","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xwwo6p","parent_id":"t1_irbcds1","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Torquin","body":"For anyone interested on how these image generators work : https://youtu.be/1CIpzeNxIhU","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For anyone interested on how these image generators work : <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1CIpzeNxIhU\">https://youtu.be/1CIpzeNxIhU</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-06 15:43:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"irc8vp7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xwwo6p","parent_id":"t1_irbcds1","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/-FilterFeeder-","body":"AI art is just the beginning.

Blockchain can combine the security of gold with even better transparency and like you mentioned possibly mechanisms to stabilize the price better, which would be perfect for reserve currencies.

Say a contentious hard fork has been proposed to increase the go-forward staking issuance (note, just a hypothetical, not something I'm expecting to happen). From my layman's perspective, I would think that a staker would be able to maintain their stake on both sides of the fork, since *(I presumed)* the two sides of the fork don't 'see' or 'speak' to one another. I would think a staker wouldn't be subject to slashing on either side, as long as they were playing by the protocol rules on each side of the fork. In other words, from each side's perspective, it would only seem like you're attesting to one block (since they can't see the activity on the other side of the fork), and thus you wouldn't be at risk of getting slashed.\n\nThis would lead me to think that the nothing at stake problem still exists for situations specifically involving a contentious hard fork, creating a scenario where stakers can theoretically 'play both sides' (as compared to miners who can only point their hash power at one side of a given fork).\n\nBut in kicking this around yesterday, u/pa7x1 was [explaining](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xw16ga/daily_general_discussion_october_5_2022/ir7lt95/) that in this scenario, a staker participating in both sides of the fork would actually *get slashed on both sides of the fork*. Rather than try to butcher his explanation, I would just say to read his two comments that I linked.\n\nWhat he's saying would be pretty amazing if it were accurate, but I guess I'm just curious to hear from other folks. Is this really how it works? If a staker is participating on both sides of a hard fork, would the protocol-level slashing mechanism truly result in them getting slashed on both sides of the fork? Can activity on one side of the fork really be seen on the other, and used as a basis for slashing? I just didn't think this type of inter-operability was possible, but I'd love for it to be so.\n\nEdit: u/aaj094 clarified elsewhere that what u/pa7x1 is saying is true only in the event that each side of the fork uses the same chain ID, which is far from a given/requirement.

Let's say up to slot *n* the network is doing fine. The block proposer for slot *n+1* is a little slow, and only about half the network sees it in time. The other half thinks they missed the slot. The block proposer for slot *n+2* happens to think it was missed and points back to a shared parent (*n*). We now have a fork, with different versions of history; somehow the network needs to decide which is valid.\n\nIn PoW this'll get naturally resolved based on which fork gets more hash power and becomes the longer chain. In PoS *without slashing* the concern is that validators are financially incentivized to vote for *both* forks so that they get their attestation reward either way it resolves. But this behavior doesn't actually help the network resolve the fork into one canonical chain; in fact it encourages keeping both forks alive as long as possible. So PoS *with slashing* forces validators to commit to one option, incentivizing fork resolution.\n\nContentious hard forks using different domains to create a clean separation between the two sets of nodes are not affected by this.
