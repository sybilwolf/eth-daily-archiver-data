He&#39;s completely unhinged, spending a good portion of his rant trying to convince people that he&#39;s not unhinged.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t port the users over because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ethical to go ahead and give those users to something that&#39;s becoming closer and closer to a scam.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The real money shot comes right after:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;They&#39;re pushing this narrative that post-merge, Ethereum Classic will rise like a phoenix and all these people are gonna make all this money and <strong>somehow, someway convince everybody to build on their platform</strong>.. Okay.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;...<strong>they have no network effect</strong>...&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The level of projection here is unreal. Charles is playing out a power fantasy here, turning common criticisms of Cardano back at Ethereum Classic.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;So, no core developers, no money, no community, and yet somehow it&#39;s a good idea to <strong>hand them</strong> 600,000 people to broadcast every day about how they&#39;re all gonna get rich now that the merge is happened, and all you gotta do is buy ETC and it&#39;s all gonna be great. But I&#39;m the sociopath for not having the courage to <strong>turn over</strong> those users there. No! I sent them to the spiritual successor of Bitcoin, which is Ergo! ... It really could use some marketing and advertising cause I believe in it, I believe in the people there.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Charles has somehow convinced himself that the Ethereum Classic twitter followers are actually <em>his</em> twitter followers, and that giving the twitter account back to its proper owners is tantamount to him &quot;handing them over&quot; or &quot;turning them over&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>And the reason he feels justified in stealing the account: He personally believes in Ergo, and doesn&#39;t believe in Ethereum Classic. Ridiculous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If they&#39;re so good at building a community, shouldn&#39;t it be very easy for them to build up a twitter handle? Shouldn&#39;t that be something, huh?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Vile. Words designed by a sociopath to try to justify his act of theft.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;No doubt you&#39;ll see lots of people in that community call me a sociopath, call me an evil person, and good riddance to those toxic assholes. Who has time for you?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You do, Charles. You went out of your way to steal Ethereum Classic&#39;s Twitter account, and then you took the time to make a video to address the blowback.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Those 600,000 users, probably 580,000 of them are bots anyway.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Insult to injury. Either Charles is actually a child with zero self awareness, or he is indeed a sociopath.</p>\n\n<p>This video is just reprehensible. Charles is reprehensible. No amount of him saying &quot;I am not a sociopath&quot; on video can change that.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-07 01:59:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"irdv97e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xxq5dt","parent_id":"t1_irdjfdw","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheHighFlyer","body":"His mind is definitely deteriorating.

Remember wealth managers influence nearly [$3 trillion](https://www.riachannel.com/understanding-the-ria-channel/) in assets, controlling a massive portion of retail\u2019s wealth.  \r  \n\r  \nThe biggest hurdle in crypto for US based RIAs (registered investment advisors) right now are extremely limited wealth management solutions (in part regulatory uncertainty doesn\u2019t help but it doesn\u2019t prevent RIAs from moving into this space either).  \r  \n \r  \nFor high net worth individuals/family offices/institutions and hedge funds, there are tons more options from private equity to non-custodial solutions, multi-sigs, etc, that provide direct access to defi protocols and the web3 space, fewer regulatory burdens and less uncertainty about what is possible. But for retail investors, if they want a financial advisor\u2019s help, they really only have two options:  \r  \n\r  \n1. Custodial solutions \u2013 where an RIA sets up accounts at a digital asset custodian and manages a strategy or basket of cryptos on behalf of their clients. This is scalable but extremely limited in what\u2019s available. In these cases the RIAs only have access to what the digital asset custodian offers on their platform. \r  \n2. Non-custodial solutions \u2013 RIAs can advise clients on which protocols to use and interact with but have no control over managing client funds with discretion (if an RIA has access to private keys, it becomes a custody issue which most RIAs want to avoid due to regulatory burdens). Unfortunately, most of the solutions I have seen are not scalable for retail clients. How could you manage x hundred of accounts where you have to manually send requests to each one and then hope the client actually follows through or meet with each client individually to walk them through the process.  \r  \n\r  \nI see this whole space evolving in a few possible ways to address some of these issues, though I imagine it could take years:  \r  \n\r  \n1. A large traditional asset custodian buys a crypto exchange (for purely illustration\u2019s sake say TD/Schwab buys Coinbase) and then can directly integrate and offer all Coinbase\u2019s products on their wealth management platform. This allows RIAs the easiest access to crypto but is still limited in what defi options remain available. \r  \n2.

What am I missing?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I\u2019m going to lay out the landscape for retail focused wealth management and crypto as I currently understand it. Remember wealth managers influence nearly <a href=\"https://www.riachannel.com/understanding-the-ria-channel/\">$3 trillion</a> in assets, controlling a massive portion of retail\u2019s wealth.  </p>\n\n<p>The biggest hurdle in crypto for US based RIAs (registered investment advisors) right now are extremely limited wealth management solutions (in part regulatory uncertainty doesn\u2019t help but it doesn\u2019t prevent RIAs from moving into this space either).  </p>\n\n<p>For high net worth individuals/family offices/institutions and hedge funds, there are tons more options from private equity to non-custodial solutions, multi-sigs, etc, that provide direct access to defi protocols and the web3 space, fewer regulatory burdens and less uncertainty about what is possible. But for retail investors, if they want a financial advisor\u2019s help, they really only have two options:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Custodial solutions \u2013 where an RIA sets up accounts at a digital asset custodian and manages a strategy or basket of cryptos on behalf of their clients. This is scalable but extremely limited in what\u2019s available. In these cases the RIAs only have access to what the digital asset custodian offers on their platform. </p></li>\n<li><p>Non-custodial solutions \u2013 RIAs can advise clients on which protocols to use and interact with but have no control over managing client funds with discretion (if an RIA has access to private keys, it becomes a custody issue which most RIAs want to avoid due to regulatory burdens). Unfortunately, most of the solutions I have seen are not scalable for retail clients. How could you manage x hundred of accounts where you have to manually send requests to each one and then hope the client actually follows through or meet with each client individually to walk them through the process.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I see this whole space evolving in a few possible ways to address some of these issues, though I imagine it could take years:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A large traditional asset custodian buys a crypto exchange (for purely illustration\u2019s sake say TD/Schwab buys Coinbase) and then can directly integrate and offer all Coinbase\u2019s products on their wealth management platform.
