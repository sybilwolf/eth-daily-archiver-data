Solana, Cardano, and <em>most</em> other L1s (NEO/Stellar at 1%) were not mentioned as viable alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>You are still early.</p>\n\n<p>**Edit: Also would like to note that the presentation stated cryptocurrencies are non-securities but real estate tokens were clearly securities.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-10 12:21:03","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-10-10 12:30:20","id":"irsqii8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_y05zgd","parent_id":"t3_y05zgd","score":42,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Kukai_walker","body":"I've been wondering if Ethereum maybe ought to de-brand itself from \"cryptocurrency\".","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering if Ethereum maybe ought to de-brand itself from &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-10 13:42:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"irt2jpa","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_y05zgd","parent_id":"t1_irsqii8","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/theethmeister","body":"I'm a bit split on the issue.

I'm assuming you haven't fallen into the leverage rabbit hole yet, so forgive me if I oversimplify or preach, just sharing from my limited experience with perpetuals and options.\n\nPerpetuals leverage trading is all about getting alpha on trends, entering and exiting reliably enough to turn a profit. It takes a ton of skill and discipline, and you might be awesome at it, but 99% of people aren't. You have to outsmart the market in the short-term and get the up/down calls consistently correct without blowing yourself up. Lots of folks are successful, but I've nuked enough \"play stacks\" to be sufficiently embarrassed; I don't have an edge and I'm mediocre at best with risk management; I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't wicked smart, dedicated, emotionally balanced, and willing to lose a lot of money to learn the ropes.\n\nIn my opinion, options offer a lot of flexibility and nuance in how you craft your position. While they're complex, you have more ability to create positive outcomes outside of just using leverage and getting the up/down call right. You can buy them, sell them, buy and sell at the same time, all at different time frames and strikes to make a range of scenarios where you make money and/or limit risk.\n\nFor example, my thesis right now is short-term crab/bear, long-term megabull: If I'm going with a perpetual protocol like GMX, I am in a difficult spot. I can't just go long an wait, or I'll pay a hefty funding rate and risk liquidation. I can't just go short, what if it just crabs or my long thesis starts to play out? I'd better be a good trader or I'm getting wrecked. Using options, I can sell short-dated calls at a strike I'm comfortable with and use the premium to stack more spot ETH or long-dated calls. I could hold my collateral in stables and sell puts. I could buy short dated, out-of-the-money puts to protect my hodl stack. \n\nDeribit (centralized) is the best way to do crypto options, right now. One day, blockchain will be an options utopia where you can trustlessly craft any position you want with instant settlement, but the codebase isn't yet mature, and the liquidity is horrible. This [article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/040915/guide-option-trading-strategies-beginners.asp) has some good basics on options, and [this one is a quick primer on perpetuals vs options](https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/crypto-derivatives).

It takes a ton of skill and discipline, and you might be awesome at it, but 99% of people aren&#39;t. You have to outsmart the market in the short-term and get the up/down calls consistently correct without blowing yourself up. Lots of folks are successful, but I&#39;ve nuked enough &quot;play stacks&quot; to be sufficiently embarrassed; I don&#39;t have an edge and I&#39;m mediocre at best with risk management; I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone who isn&#39;t wicked smart, dedicated, emotionally balanced, and willing to lose a lot of money to learn the ropes.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, options offer a lot of flexibility and nuance in how you craft your position. While they&#39;re complex, you have more ability to create positive outcomes outside of just using leverage and getting the up/down call right. You can buy them, sell them, buy and sell at the same time, all at different time frames and strikes to make a range of scenarios where you make money and/or limit risk.</p>\n\n<p>For example, my thesis right now is short-term crab/bear, long-term megabull: If I&#39;m going with a perpetual protocol like GMX, I am in a difficult spot. I can&#39;t just go long an wait, or I&#39;ll pay a hefty funding rate and risk liquidation. I can&#39;t just go short, what if it just crabs or my long thesis starts to play out? I&#39;d better be a good trader or I&#39;m getting wrecked. Using options, I can sell short-dated calls at a strike I&#39;m comfortable with and use the premium to stack more spot ETH or long-dated calls. I could hold my collateral in stables and sell puts. I could buy short dated, out-of-the-money puts to protect my hodl stack. </p>\n\n<p>Deribit (centralized) is the best way to do crypto options, right now. One day, blockchain will be an options utopia where you can trustlessly craft any position you want with instant settlement, but the codebase isn&#39;t yet mature, and the liquidity is horrible. This <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/040915/guide-option-trading-strategies-beginners.asp\">article</a> has some good basics on options, and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/crypto-derivatives\">this one is a quick primer on perpetuals vs options</a>.
