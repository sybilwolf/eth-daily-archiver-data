Everything's on indecision candles. No need for a long post with pictures of dojis on every chart. Just focusing on two main things ahead of tomorrow's BS.\n\nBonds are still holding up at these catastrophic lows. [HYG](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6Ze6Nxvw/) is keeping its head just above that Covid volume bunch. And more recent champion [LQD](https://www.tradingview.com/x/s9ZUOOkk/) is at the literal hellish depths of the Covid bottom already, and so far fending off desolation. Each is on higher lows on the daily. HYG has a bull div on the weekly. LQD *may* have a bull div but it's up to the individual trader, as the divergence requires you to go back to May 2 and could intercept other lows on your chart. Overall, *both* are positively diverging from the indices. A potential boon for bulls.\n\n[And here's my most up-to-date take on SPY.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xfttENXE/) I'll leave these lines until the pattern meaningfully breaks. Timeline not to scale.\n\nToday's stagnant \"failure\" represented day 3 of failing to break above the 370-374 gap, now orange. That level will likely provide the next major resistance should we turn up, after 366 presents a little speed bump of its own. \n\nHOWEVER, I've awarded a \"day 4\" of gap fills in the past for major BS new events and I'll do so here. Yes, if SPY can somehow muster a nigh unfathomable +4% day back above 374 on some wacky CPI print, then we'll need a new chart as the bottom may very well be in.\n\nIn that line of thought, the recent green gap down from Mon into Tues remains open, seems easy to enough to fill, and is part of the Mario Kart speed pad the bulls will need in order to bounce here.\n\nDownward targets are of course psych level 350, where the bull market truly began in Nov 2020, and 342.\n\nThere is a glimmer of another story being told here. Don't buy in 100% to just a single story. Up or down here, we can't know, but we do have targets. Manage risk. Set stops. Don't let anyone -- and certainly not me -- tell you how to navigate this next market move.

Just focusing on two main things ahead of tomorrow&#39;s BS.</p>\n\n<p>Bonds are still holding up at these catastrophic lows. <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/6Ze6Nxvw/\">HYG</a> is keeping its head just above that Covid volume bunch. And more recent champion <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/s9ZUOOkk/\">LQD</a> is at the literal hellish depths of the Covid bottom already, and so far fending off desolation. Each is on higher lows on the daily. HYG has a bull div on the weekly. LQD <em>may</em> have a bull div but it&#39;s up to the individual trader, as the divergence requires you to go back to May 2 and could intercept other lows on your chart. Overall, <em>both</em> are positively diverging from the indices. A potential boon for bulls.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/xfttENXE/\">And here&#39;s my most up-to-date take on SPY.</a> I&#39;ll leave these lines until the pattern meaningfully breaks. Timeline not to scale.</p>\n\n<p>Today&#39;s stagnant &quot;failure&quot; represented day 3 of failing to break above the 370-374 gap, now orange. That level will likely provide the next major resistance should we turn up, after 366 presents a little speed bump of its own. </p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, I&#39;ve awarded a &quot;day 4&quot; of gap fills in the past for major BS new events and I&#39;ll do so here. Yes, if SPY can somehow muster a nigh unfathomable +4% day back above 374 on some wacky CPI print, then we&#39;ll need a new chart as the bottom may very well be in.</p>\n\n<p>In that line of thought, the recent green gap down from Mon into Tues remains open, seems easy to enough to fill, and is part of the Mario Kart speed pad the bulls will need in order to bounce here.</p>\n\n<p>Downward targets are of course psych level 350, where the bull market truly began in Nov 2020, and 342.</p>\n\n<p>There is a glimmer of another story being told here. Don&#39;t buy in 100% to just a single story. Up or down here, we can&#39;t know, but we do have targets. Manage risk. Set stops. Don&#39;t let anyone -- and certainly not me -- tell you how to navigate this next market move.

I likely wont use them because of that and will stick to more decentralized solutions, but they&#39;re still a better alternative than fully centralized options, and it may be there&#39;s a market for hybrid options like DAI, that have some advantages of decentralization with some the scaling of centralized options.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean, they just pivoted 180 from what the project set out to do. And I dont even think its better than more centralized options, you get all the risk without any of the benefits. It&#39;s an explicitly worse USDC at this point.</p>\n\n<p>None of these takes are totally unreasonable, they&#39;re just ALL leaning towards MORE centralization/censorship/things we hate. And for the same person to be majorly involved in ALL these decisions...
