I'm talking about the preconditions for knowledge. You can't hold a worldview that leads to a certain conclusion and then hold beliefs within that worldview that contradict your worldview. You then become incoherent.\n\nAnd by the way only real justified conclusion you can reach based on what you wrote is that we  just don't understand the quantum world very well. That's it.
