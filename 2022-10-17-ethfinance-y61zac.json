We only have five relay operators, with one of them being Manifold. Only bloXroute and Manifold offer uncensored block building, so we don't have many choices and could really use more. So I started wondering if it would be feasible for me, perhaps with a little team of like-minded individuals, to run one. I've been thinking about it for a few days and don't have a complete answer about whether it's really feasible or now, but I do have a long list of considerations.\n\n* **Code:** Flashbots' mev-boost relay code is [open source](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay). [Blocknative](https://github.com/blocknative/dreamboat) and [Eden](https://github.com/eden-network/mev-boost-relay) both have their relays open-sourced as well, so it's possible to see if there's anything important. Eden's seems vanilla, Blocknative's is actually a completely separate implementation.\n* **Operation:** Flashbots' relay looks a little finnicky to run. Not as clean out of the box as a validator stack and probably requires spending some time getting to know the components and options. I would want to test thoroughly. Shouldn't be a huge problem for people with the right background.\n* **Mempool access and block building:** All of the existing relays are operated as components of larger systems for transaction submission. Private mempools offering JSON-RPC connections and advertising fast speeds and high network connectivity. It makes sense that existing teams working on transaction submission systems would be best equipped to quickly spin up a relay. This also means the existing relays are also operating block builders that tie into their own mempools. I think it's interesting to consider to what extent a new relay would want to accept users' transactions and build blocks.\n* **Compute/bandwidth costs:** Relays must run an Ethereum EL+CL client in order to properly simulate blocks. I am unsure how much more computationally expensive it is to run these simulations. If each builder submits one block per slot, is the number of builders simply a multiplicative factor on top of a regular EL+CL load? How much overhead is it to relay validator registrations?\n* **Duties:** The most critical duties a relay performs are following up on block publishing and ensuring validator payouts. Relays give proposers a block header for a builder's block, and if the proposers sign it then they're committed to that block and the relay *must* publish it to the network. The relay also needs to simulate the block and make sure the proposer will receive their tips+MEV as advertised. The relay can screw over the proposer by withholding the block or not getting the validator their reward, so there is trust involved.\n* **Uptime:** It's not critical for a relay to be up all the time (unless they're running a mempool/RPC and need to serve those users). In case of issues, the relay can go down and validators running mev-boost will smoothly fall back to other relays or local production. Unexpected downtime is only a real issue if it prevents block publication.\n* **User support and trust:** Relays need to be trusted to carry out their duties, and operators may consider doxxing themselves and/or being visible and accessible on social media. As we've seen with Manifold, sometimes things go wrong and operators need to react appropriately to restore and maintain trust.\n* **Finances:** Running a relay produces no income. I assume existing relays find income through users paying to access their mempool or running their own MEV-extracting builders. I wonder if a relay could survive being run as a public good, funded through charitable giving.\n* **Growth and usage:** A relay does no good if nobody adds it to their mev-boost relay list. It also does no good if the offers it produces aren't competitive with other relays and it never gets selected. A relay without its own mempool and block building will have to rely on submissions from third-party builders, so you need builders to connect and send you blocks. Being staunchly anti-censorship and building a good reputation is a start, but it's still necessary to run a sort of PR campaign to get the word out there.\n* **Commitment:** Once a relay is running, operators will need to spend time on system/software updates, managing social media / user support / PR, paying expenses, seeking funding, and keeping up-to-date on the direction of the area as a whole. It's not a negligible time commitment.\n\nI think that summarizes my main thoughts. I'm kind of seriously considering working on this. Would love to hear thoughts and corrections.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What does it take at this point to run a mev-boost relay?

The models were all valid for a post-merge world. Well, we are in a post-merge world and we have 1 month of data to look back so it's a good time to see how they are faring.\n\n**Monetary Price Model** \n\nThis model is pretty easy to understand, it calculates an Ethereum price lower bound based on supply and demand. It basically calculates at which price, given network revenues, the burn equals issuance and therefore the network sees 0 inflation. This price is pretty significant because prices below it are not sustainable long-term as token keeps getting destroyed ad-infinitum which is a mathematical impossibility so at some point supply scarcity will force the price up. And prices above it require constant buy pressure to sustain.\n\nDuring the past 30 days we have observed daily network revenues of ~ $ 2.5M.\nAnd total amount of staked ETH is araound 14M ETH.\n\nWith these figures the monetary price is ~ USD 1231.\n\nGraph for convenience: https://imgur.com/a/hLm8vMm\n\nNot only is the price hovering around the price-range the model predicts but the monetary price seems to be acting rather well as a lower bound/resistance. Does this mean the price has to be there? No! But prices below it are unsustainable long-term and prices above it require constant buy pressure to sustain.\n\n**Yield Model**\n\nThe yield model takes network revenues and total staked ETH and asks you what yield would you like to achieve, with this information it spits out at which price you get that yield. Or conversely, you can input a price in the yield calculator and it will tell you what yield you get. I cannot tell you what yield you would like to obtain, but we can look at the yield the market is willing to obtain. We can look here for the data: https://beaconcha.in/charts/historic_pool_performance\n\nETH.STORE represents the average return and is hovering at around 5.3%. We can use the yield calculator to see what price returns the aforementioned yield and we get ~ USD 1250. To be noted that the models do not include MEV, might get to it one day. As above we are using the average fees of the last 30 days.\n\nTo be fair, this test is a consistency check that we are calculating correctly the yield. Observed yield, network revenues, total staked ETH and price all tie together so we are not predicting anything if we give it all the inputs. But this tells you that the yield model is computing it correctly so you can rely on it to extrapolate what yield you would obtain if either fee revenues change or to understand what would be the expected yield at different prices.\n\n**DCF**\n\nThis model is the gold standard of valuation and tells you what staked ETH is worth based on its future cash flows. You can give it your expected rate of return as the discount rate. And make an assumption of network revenue growth rate in the years to come. This model is in a way the complete version of the previous 2. It uses the monetary price model as the long-term valuation and uses yield to estimate the ongoing cashflows.\n\nThe hard part is forecasting correctly the network revenues and the expected rate of return (this depends implicitly on the risk free rate). But in the spirit of all models are wrong, some are useful, you can tinker with it to create different scenarios and understand what would be the fair valuation of the token. For example:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n\nExpected rate of return: 15% (i.e. you want to see 15% annualized returns)\n\nNetwork revenues growth rate: 30% (i.e. 3x in 5 years)\n\nETH price: $ 2700.\n\nWhich means you should be willing to buy ETH and stake it at that price as you will obtain a 15% yield.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\nExpected rate of return: 5%\n\nNetwork revenues growth rate: 0% \n\nETH price: $ 1420\n\nIf you are happy to obtain 5% yield and don't think Ethereum is going to grow at all in the next coming years you should be willing to buy and stake ETH at $ 1420. We are below that price, let that sink in.\n\n**Scenario 3:**\n\nExpected rate of return: 15%\n\nNetwork revenues growth rate: 70% (i.e. we take 5 years to go back to network revenues we saw last year)\n\nETH price: $ 6600.\n\n\nEstimating a growth rate for an asset like ETH is very hard, in fact the growth rate might be highly volatile as it goes through creative destruction booms and busts. You can tinker with the spreadsheet to change the growth every year to match your expectations. You should also apply a generous margin of safety.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>End of 2021 I shared here my <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum/\">fundamental valuation models of Ethereum</a> where I tried to explain how the Ethereum tokenomics could be used to calculate a fair valuation of the token.
