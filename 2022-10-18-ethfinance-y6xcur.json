It's worth reminding ourselves how this currently works: a proposer connected to a relay is given a header and must sign it without seeing the block body (containing the transactions). The relay is acting as a trusted escrow. It is designed like because otherwise a proposer might steal the MEV a searcher has found, for example by changing the --fee-recipient address.\n\nFlashbots dominates the relay space because it has the best searchers yielding the most MEV. So there is a significant economic incentive for validators to point at them. At the same time, the FB relays are OFAC compliant, meaning there is in theory a chance the proposer's block will be censoring a tornado cash transaction in the mempool.\n\nIn practice, there are actually [very few](https://nitter.net/eliasimos/status/1580272373516812288) OFAC sanction/TC transactions occurring on the network right now. In other words, if a validator is concerned about censorship, most of the time it can be - statistically speaking - reassured that this is very unlikely. Of course, the OFAC list might be expanded to include other \"undesirable\" protocols or private transactions, so the problem might get worse and this feels quite likely given the rise in zK based systems.\n\nIdeally, a censorship conscious validator that wants to participate in the MEV ecosystem needs a guarantee of some kind from the relay. An \"inclusion list\" is one potential path forward here. It allows a local proposing validator to  specify any transactions which must be included by the builder from their local view of the mempool, and then trustlessly verify that returned block headers meet this requirement before signing. Nishant of Prysm was the first to make an issue on the [flashbots github](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs/issues/52) with this in mind, and this has been worked up into a [document](https://hackmd.io/5rrA0KfBTFS7uvIEg41Lag). \n\nIt's reassuring to see that this is actively being thought about while in-protocol solutions like crLists and PBS feel years away from implementation, and it would be good to see some noise behind it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>OFAC compliance and censorship in the MEV-Boost and relay architecture is topical and fairly controversial right now .

Of course, the OFAC list might be expanded to include other &quot;undesirable&quot; protocols or private transactions, so the problem might get worse and this feels quite likely given the rise in zK based systems.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, a censorship conscious validator that wants to participate in the MEV ecosystem needs a guarantee of some kind from the relay. An &quot;inclusion list&quot; is one potential path forward here. It allows a local proposing validator to  specify any transactions which must be included by the builder from their local view of the mempool, and then trustlessly verify that returned block headers meet this requirement before signing. Nishant of Prysm was the first to make an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs/issues/52\">flashbots github</a> with this in mind, and this has been worked up into a <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/5rrA0KfBTFS7uvIEg41Lag\">document</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s reassuring to see that this is actively being thought about while in-protocol solutions like crLists and PBS feel years away from implementation, and it would be good to see some noise behind it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-18 03:33:46","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-10-18 04:41:38","id":"issbr65","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_y6xcur","parent_id":"t3_y6xcur","score":43,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Njaa","body":">Flashbots dominates the relay space because it has the best searchers yielding the most MEV.

Is this a September 2018 kind of boring, or a February 2019 kind of boring?  I don't know, but I'm certain there's more excitement coming our way.  One thing I'll note is that BTC has spent most of the last six weeks below its December 2017 high.  While one can reasonably question the significance of this development, the \"BTC always stays above its previous mania peaks\" narrative is dead.  The June low happened under exceptional circumstances, but we're now accustomed to floating not far above it.  Markets take their time, and my near-term bias is bullish.

Like it or not, BTC remains crypto's financial center of gravity (for the record, BTC is less than 1% of my portfolio, and emphatically not the development center).  In my opinion, the merge has locked in a future flippening, but patience is key.  Post-merge issuance reduction is living up to the hype; all indications are that PoS is working beautifully, with effectively fixed supply under modest network load.  MEV/censorship concerns are worth keeping in mind, but the Ethereum community appears appropriately dedicated to preserving protocol neutrality.  Even in a period of market quiescence, building continues at an impressive pace.  VC-shilled \"competitors\" aren't even playing the same game.  I'm bored, but I remain supremely confident in my investment.  \n\nAs someone who has \"made it\" in crypto (which I define as holding a desk-shit-worthy amount after recovery of outside investment), what's my advice?  Have a plan, and stick to it.  This process will take longer than you want.  The crypto market is a notorious hive of scum and villainy, exquisitely tuned to use your emotions against you.  In the long run, the only way to survive and thrive is to tell your feelings to fuck right off.  Personally, that means continuing with my \"every 22%\" strategy, but pointed down instead of up.  During the recent bull, I started selling at $982 (and as high as $4819!); if we go far enough the other way, I'll start buying at $805 (then $660, $541, etc).  If that never happens, great.  If things get really bad, I won't run out of money to buy the dip until we're below $250.  Either way, I'll be content with my choices.

I'll try to use an analogy to explain everything, but you are the first on the hear/ read about it so everything could be wrong. Also I am most likely late to the party if my thoughts make sense, but for me it's still important to structure my thoughts. So let's dive in. \n\n**Ethereum and why 4844 is so important for its yield management**\n\nEthereum started as a \"one size fits all\" blockchain (as probably every other blockchain back then). There was no distinction between transactions, apart from being slightly cheaper or more expensive based on the smart contract used and hence the amount of computation needed. This was fine for some time, but as we all know it didn't / doesn't scale. At some point fees were 100USD+ over weeks with peaks during crashes (or mints) that were unheard of. \n\nBasically ETH was a plane that started as a small plane for everyone, but became a first class plane over time which was really only accessible for either rich people or (crazy?) plane enthusiasts. First (pre 1559, with PGA) there was basically a flexible first class for people that paid more to pick the best seat on every flight, including getting the best sandwich served for lunch. This could lead to no/ a mini first class on some flights and basically a 100% first class on other flights, basically depending on who would also buy tickets and fly with you (or sometimes to chase someone who took the place before you). The ticket buying process changed slightly with EIP-1559, but especially during holidays and vacation you sometimes couldn't buy a ticket or planes were overbooked and you were basically asked to travel some hours or even days later. \n\nETH tourists were prized out of using ETH and hence picked other airlines to still be able to fly around the world.

I&#39;ll try to use an analogy to explain everything, but you are the first on the hear/ read about it so everything could be wrong. Also I am most likely late to the party if my thoughts make sense, but for me it&#39;s still important to structure my thoughts. So let&#39;s dive in. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Ethereum and why 4844 is so important for its yield management</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ethereum started as a &quot;one size fits all&quot; blockchain (as probably every other blockchain back then). There was no distinction between transactions, apart from being slightly cheaper or more expensive based on the smart contract used and hence the amount of computation needed. This was fine for some time, but as we all know it didn&#39;t / doesn&#39;t scale. At some point fees were 100USD+ over weeks with peaks during crashes (or mints) that were unheard of. </p>\n\n<p>Basically ETH was a plane that started as a small plane for everyone, but became a first class plane over time which was really only accessible for either rich people or (crazy?) plane enthusiasts. First (pre 1559, with PGA) there was basically a flexible first class for people that paid more to pick the best seat on every flight, including getting the best sandwich served for lunch. This could lead to no/ a mini first class on some flights and basically a 100% first class on other flights, basically depending on who would also buy tickets and fly with you (or sometimes to chase someone who took the place before you). The ticket buying process changed slightly with EIP-1559, but especially during holidays and vacation you sometimes couldn&#39;t buy a ticket or planes were overbooked and you were basically asked to travel some hours or even days later. </p>\n\n<p>ETH tourists were prized out of using ETH and hence picked other airlines to still be able to fly around the world. ETH had a clear target audience, but lost a lot of customers because of its price policy - ETH became a first class only airline. But there had to be a way to retain those ETH tourists from back in the days without losing your current audience? </p>\n\n<p>The solutions is of course L2 airlines With L2s/ execution layers ETH airlines will introduce a new type of plane (kind of). Those planes are actually ETH planes, but from more or less souvereign independent airlines. They are part of ETH alliance, where they benefit from some of ETHs infrastructure and security.

If the first class is fully booked prices go up for L2 airlines (which is not really a problem now, but might be a problem if there are more L2 airlines and demand is rising). </p>\n\n<p>So this is where 4844 comes into play. ETH basically changes its ecosystem to help L2 airlines, without hurting its first class. The first class will still travel on L1 airlines where there is all the security and luxury of ETH and its L1 environment. After 4844 has been implemented the infrastructure of the ETH airport will have a second terminal for L2 airlines.

Down the road we will actually see a dedicated economy class (L3s), which is already starting to emerge from the development of L2 airlines and their infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p>Result: Only if ETH adds both execution layers and 4844, which disconnects L2 fees from L1 fees the ETH ecosystem will really be able to capture the audience it has lost to its competition in 2021, because only then it will be able to offer fees that really allow everyone to travel within the ETH alliance.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-18 01:14:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iss25ds","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_y6xcur","parent_id":"t3_y6xcur","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"I am rather sure my analogy isn't perfect, mostly because the airport/ terminal idea came in pretty late and I was too lazy to rewrite everything. \n\nLooking forward to any feedback and changes you suggest to make it work!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am rather sure my analogy isn&#39;t perfect, mostly because the airport/ terminal idea came in pretty late and I was too lazy to rewrite everything. </p>\n\n<p>Looking forward to any feedback and changes you suggest to make it work!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-18 01:15:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iss28w1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_y6xcur","parent_id":"t1_iss25ds","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Fuzzman99","body":"So basically what you are saying is that ETH L1 is a legacy premium class airline and it is investing in a new startup low cost carrier (L2) which it will back with infrastructure from the parent company.\n\nIE.
