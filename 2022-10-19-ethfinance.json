The whole point of crypto is censorship-resistance. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re assuming it&#39;s out of fear. But out of fear of what, exactly? Most people are fearless behind their computers, hence the huge number of trolls. No, rather, it&#39;s most probably out of a lack of interest to answer more than anything. Rather than answering with text, they vote with their wallets by buying whatever they want. </p>\n\n<p>The whole concept of centrally regulating investments to protect investors makes absolutely no sense anyway: it&#39;s investors, aka people who are necessarily considered responsible enough to vote, an activity that is way more important than their individual choices in investment and the outcome for their financial health. That&#39;s why pretending these people aren&#39;t responsible enough to invest in whatever they want necessarily is a claim of disbelief in democracy itself.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, why wouldn&#39;t we do the same with votes and prevent people from voting and dismissing the vote results when people vote badly? It would very obviously be considered extremely fascist, as it should. Just as with investment regulations.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-19 02:19:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iswz9fp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_y7tddk","parent_id":"t1_iswwnuz","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/REALJohnBMacLemore","body":"Perleflamme!
