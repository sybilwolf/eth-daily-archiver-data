She's one person on a committee of many so it's still entirely possible she gets smacked down (and us along with her) by JPow or others next week in comments. Most important is that... we're about to have a whole ton of headlines with misleading lingo. Let's educate ourselves. Even if they slow hikes, that is NOT a \"pivot\"; that is \"the Fed stepping in / intervening\". A pivot is when hikes stop, currently priced in for April/May 2023. Still, an intervention is exactly what we were betting on for mid-October and midterms so they might pile on and send this thing.\n* Less organically is the DXY today. It probably wasn't weakened as much by Daly's comments as it was by Japan's central bank selling nearly $20bn to preserve the yen -- AGAIN. They hadn't spent like this since the '97 financial crisis and now they've done it twice in two months. Good for equities in the short-term? Sure, yeah, of course. Sign of health? Hahaha no.\n* Hidden bear div on the SPY daily, which to me says that if there's going to be a further downward surprise, it would almost have to be this Monday or possibly Tuesday.\n* Yet, bank earnings were overall pretty good and our friends in bonds were happy with the green moves. Bonds were lower in volume suggesting smart money is likely still waiting for one final signal, but that can happen in a flash.\n\nIn conclusion, moves like today make the chance of a final SPY 342 / ETH 975 buy start to fade away like Marty McFly at the Under the Sea dance. SPY 350 may have been it, if the rest of the Fed joins with Daly and market makers feel their bear stomachs are full enough for this next final mega-rip. \n\nNext week is quiet in news, with just China wrapping up policy and reporting on Sunday.

You guys are still *grossly* overestimating the effect that supply inflation had on price IMO.  Since the merge, total supply has gone from 120.521M to 120.523M.  If you assume the market cap stays the same, that's a devaluation of $0.03/ETH.  If we had stayed on PoW, total supply would have gone up to 120.955M, which would have devalued ETH by about $4.50, so we'd be at $1281.50 instead of $1286.\n\nNow there is reason to believe that the market cap would not stay the same, due to limited liquidity there is a multiplication factor, where every $1 of ETH sold drops the market cap by $1\\*X.  There are many estimates for \"X\", and it varies over time, but a decent rule of thumb that I've seen is around 10, so every $1 of ETH sold drops the market cap by $10.  Using that rule, the PoW inflation would have dropped the price by more like $50 since the merge.  That's still only 3%, that's a fart in the wind in this market.  Price changes due to supply inflation are **nothing** compared to speculation and trading.\n\nI'm glad the merge happened, and the price being $50 higher after month is better than being $50 lower, but traders are still going to trade, and 90% of our price movements are going to be exactly the same as they would have been under PoW.  If some force was going to push the price down by 50% under PoW, then maybe we only drop 47% under PoS, in the end that's really not much of a difference.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Prices at the margin can only go down so much longer at this rate\u2026</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>People keep saying that, but it&#39;s still not true.

Refusing to include any \"bad\" transactions in the block they're building\n\n2. Refusing to attest to any blocks containing \"bad\" transactions even if they've been built by other validators\n\nCurrently we're dealing with 1, due to MEV-Boost having \"OFAC compliant\" relays with a market share of over 50% of blocks built. It's not that validators don't want to include bad transactions, it's that they plug into the most profitable block builders, which happen to be OFAC compliant. It's definitely not ideal, but we're still far, far from the existential threat that would happen in the second scenario. MEV boost doesn't tell validators how to attest to other blocks, and there's no strategy where it's somehow more profitable to refuse to attest to uncensored blocks.\n\nIn the first scenario, those \"bad\" transactions eventually get confirmed by a non-censoring validators even if 51% of validators censor. It's still very much a cause for concern, and we should spend efforts developping better censorship-resistant tools/incentives etc. but in the mean time, 51% censoring just means tornado cash transaction will just take on average 24 seconds to confirm instead of 12. No social slashing fork is necessary here.\n\n*If* we were dealing with scenario 2, it would be an actual existential threat. Without any changes in the code, >51% of validators deciding to ignore \"bad\" blocks containing \"bad\" transactions would mean they always win the vote, and the 49% of non-censoring validators will always eventually readjust to follow along with whatever the 51% says the correct fork is, and tornado cash transactions would never get included in any block that eventually gets finalized. It's honestly not a very likely scenario when you take time to [play out the necessary steps leading up to it](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1562004148442243073) but nonetheless it's still something we gotta be prepared for, and it's important to signal to potential censorers considering scenario 2 that we will not stand for it and their entire stake is, well, at stake lol\n\nScenario 2 is where a fork would happen: We would see who the 51% are, how they build blocks and how they attest to other blocks, we would see how the 49% constantly miss block proposals that were otherwise seen, etc. We would get to add an extra condition in the code to (just an example among many options) say \"my nodes only listens to the 49% of non-censoring validators\" and that's when the split would happen. People running full nodes (even if they don't stake) get to choose which fork they listen to and consider valid, depending on which software they run. If we as a community all update to that new version, the censoring validators end up on their own useless fork where their ETH is worth nothing. They would instead register as inactive on the uncensored fork, and after a few days enough of their balance would have leaked away and the non-censored fork would start finalizing again, this time the 49% representing 100% of the stake, with millions of ETH having vanished. Now if whatever entity that censored wants to try again, they have to buy enough ETH on the uncensored fork to stake and try again, and the same scenario will just repeat enough times until honest validators represent >51% of the supply (not just stake) and then it's straight up impossible to do the attack again. And every time this happens, the censoring entity has to burn a shitton of money and wait a couple months for all their validators to become active.\n\nIn practice the social bit is messy as it involves exchanges, stablecoin providers, wallet infrastructure, etc. but the point is that ultimately users, not validators, have the control over which fork is legitimate. The argument presented in the article is that the uncensored fork would be the one with most of the economic weight because a permissioned Ethereum is really just a shitty slow computer and who would want to build on it? There are much easier ways to optimize a blockchain if you get rid of the permissionless and censorship-resistance aspects that we value.\n\nReally the article is a bit alarmist, they likely took Justin Drake's words out of context and removed all the nuance of these two different scenarios.
