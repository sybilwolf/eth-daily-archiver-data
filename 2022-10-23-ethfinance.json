For starters, there&#39;s always an option to open up OS sort by volume for the last 30day or smth and go thru 200-300 projects manually and look thru them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also I am still looking to find other utility NFTs that have baked in value accrual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You are thinking of NFTs as stablescoins right now and I cant remember any besides the idols right now. Try to think of other NFTs as ETH or other cryptos and look for the value in that way. If it has value while it&#39;s not baked my some money there must be something else right? Or if not, then my thinking would be &quot;it&#39;s probably a speculation or scam&quot; but that&#39;s flawed to me and I feel this is like most of people who are not into crypto think about crypto. Get curious and explore what has value and how things have value in NFTs and then pick categories maybe that you wanna collect. That also ties into another point.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ideally I\u2019m hoping to build an NFT portfolio that will lay the groundwork for my digital identity, serve as general self expression of what I like, and also maybe (later on) be able to leverage the value of my NFTs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>cause the sense I&#39;m getting from this is that NFTs are something vague. Like there&#39;s so many art nfts or nfts that allow you to have access to communities, to some bots, to alpha chats, to other tools, to communities, etc.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-23 02:15:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"itfrl64","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yb8m0a","parent_id":"t1_itfmu5w","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/the-A-word","body":"This is great advice","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is great advice</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-23 06:27:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"itgdnha","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yb8m0a","parent_id":"t1_itfrl64","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/proof-of-lake","body":"I don't want to come across as shilling, but you did ask for ideas, so take this only as a suggestion - look into ethlizards.
