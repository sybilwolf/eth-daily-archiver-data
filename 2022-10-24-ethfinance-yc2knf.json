It only shares properties that are required by Ponzi schemes and make it unsustainable long term if it doesn&#39;t change, which Ethereum did with ETH. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like more chains to try and do that, frankly, either through token burning or another mean. </p>\n\n<p>And I&#39;ll even go to claim that any amount of long term price stability required to have people use these tokens for day-to-day transactions will need some yield implementation (although ETH itself isn&#39;t designed to fulfill such use case in my opinion, others may be more appropriate for that).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-24 15:14:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"itnb7ir","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yc2knf","parent_id":"t3_yc2knf","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Having a design that inherently benefits early adopters is perfectly normal and not in itself a Ponzi even if that design subsidizes eventual costs from future adopters.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Having a design that inherently benefits early adopters is perfectly normal and not in itself a Ponzi even if that design subsidizes eventual costs from future adopters.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-24 16:50:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"itnnwqd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yc2knf","parent_id":"t1_itnb7ir","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Dont_Waver","body":"Exactly.
