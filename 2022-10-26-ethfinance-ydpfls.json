I'll just go down my list of things, live editing this post.\n\n* [BTC bulls will be back in charge of the daily chart (and their own destiny) for the first time since late March with a close above $20,345.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zh7eKR0A/) Interesting to note that initial rejection at the 100-Day MA @ $20.9k.\n* [ETH, unfortunately, will not be in bullish control until much higher at $1775 due to the October 13 shenanigans.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/g37YUtNl/) However, it's above a downward sloping 100-Day MA and... the top of the Summer Channel (a magnet, for sure) is only another 15% away. It's not impossible for higher beta ETH to pull off a miracle. Break and confirm 1775 and the bear market ends.\n   * Leverage traders... you'll note ETH is ridiculously overbought and that hidden bear div from the 1775 \"top\" is stronger than ever. Even if the bear market is ending, that rubber band can still snap to one final chance for buys.\n* Very interesting to look at this next pair, our old favorites DXY and SPY.\n   * [DXY has set a new Local Lower Low, but not a True Lower Low based on oscillators.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WSpzl404/) We watched this morning as 110.71 broke (just as we discussed yesterday) and the market went ballistic, surging further as the prior low 110 was left behind. Now we've got the 100-Day MA rushing up and would you look at that... 108.33 ... the SEPT 12 TRUE LOW. Numbers, amirite?\n   * On the other side, [SPY has already tested and been rejected off its 100-Day MA and is fighting against a close back below the 50-Day MA.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/greBMpjC/) All of these things work in tandem. With the tech sector collapsing / diverging, will the dollar be a lagging indicator this time around?\n   * There won't be any surprises. The dollar going back below 108.30 will coincide with SPY racing back to 400. They'll move together. What happens before then is what we watch.\n   * One thing I know is we don't want to see the DXY anywhere near back at 110.05 upon close. That would give it the same exact look as the August 10 local bottom, just before the next rugpull.\n* Smart money -- bond canaries -- are... just so damn hesitant to give the full-bore thumbs-up.\n   * [HYG has a sort of local higher high](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FTgbwYbH/), but not *really* and certainly nowhere near a True Higher High on oscillators. Also facing rejection at the 50-Day MA.\n   * [LQD has escaped the sloppy downtrend line I had there, but nothing else to report.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YduuBCFc/) At the very least, a backtest of that line seems needed?\n* [AAPL appears to be finally breaking down, but they've inversed on earnings before.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kpiEqX8J/) I'm not speculating, just watching.\n* Yields... The 10Y and 2Y are mostly doing the same thing, so we'll use the 10Y for easier numbers\n   * [Right now it just... kinda looks like a healthy retest?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/npeMFkmV/) That's not a healthy thing for market bulls.

I&#39;ll just go down my list of things, live editing this post.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/zh7eKR0A/\">BTC bulls will be back in charge of the daily chart (and their own destiny) for the first time since late March with a close above $20,345.</a> Interesting to note that initial rejection at the 100-Day MA @ $20.9k.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/g37YUtNl/\">ETH, unfortunately, will not be in bullish control until much higher at $1775 due to the October 13 shenanigans.</a> However, it&#39;s above a downward sloping 100-Day MA and... the top of the Summer Channel (a magnet, for sure) is only another 15% away. It&#39;s not impossible for higher beta ETH to pull off a miracle. Break and confirm 1775 and the bear market ends.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leverage traders... you&#39;ll note ETH is ridiculously overbought and that hidden bear div from the 1775 &quot;top&quot; is stronger than ever. Even if the bear market is ending, that rubber band can still snap to one final chance for buys.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Very interesting to look at this next pair, our old favorites DXY and SPY.\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/WSpzl404/\">DXY has set a new Local Lower Low, but not a True Lower Low based on oscillators.</a> We watched this morning as 110.71 broke (just as we discussed yesterday) and the market went ballistic, surging further as the prior low 110 was left behind. Now we&#39;ve got the 100-Day MA rushing up and would you look at that... 108.33 ... the SEPT 12 TRUE LOW. Numbers, amirite?</li>\n<li>On the other side, <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/greBMpjC/\">SPY has already tested and been rejected off its 100-Day MA and is fighting against a close back below the 50-Day MA.</a> All of these things work in tandem. With the tech sector collapsing / diverging, will the dollar be a lagging indicator this time around?</li>\n<li>There won&#39;t be any surprises. The dollar going back below 108.30 will coincide with SPY racing back to 400. They&#39;ll move together. What happens before then is what we watch.</li>\n<li>One thing I know is we don&#39;t want to see the DXY anywhere near back at 110.05 upon close. That would give it the same exact look as the August 10 local bottom, just before the next rugpull.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Smart money -- bond canaries -- are... just so damn hesitant to give the full-bore thumbs-up.\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/FTgbwYbH/\">HYG has a sort of local higher high</a>, but not <em>really</em> and certainly nowhere near a True Higher High on oscillators. Also facing rejection at the 50-Day MA.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/YduuBCFc/\">LQD has escaped the sloppy downtrend line I had there, but nothing else to report.</a> At the very least, a backtest of that line seems needed?</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/kpiEqX8J/\">AAPL appears to be finally breaking down, but they&#39;ve inversed on earnings before.</a> I&#39;m not speculating, just watching.</li>\n<li>Yields...
