After all, if each block stays exactly at the 100% gas target, gas price will never change.\n\nThis phenomenon can be explained by simple math. Gas price changes whenever the previous block's gas usage deviates from 15M gas. It increases by 12.5% at 30M gas, and decreases by 12.5% at 0M gas. Any value between the 2 limits affects price proportionally up to 12.5%.\n\n**So what happens if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block?**\n\n    (x+a) * (x-a) = x^2 - a^2\n    (1 + 0.125) * (1 - 0.125) = 98.4% => 2.6% price decrease\n\nThus if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block, the gas price would still fall 2.6% even though the average gas usage stays at 15M gas. The larger the volatility from the 15M-gas target, the larger the negative price pressure.\n\n**In fact, in an extreme theoretical case where there were one full day of 30M-gas blocks followed by another full day of 0M-gas blocks, the gas price on the 3rd day would be 10^50 times smaller despite that the average usage between the 2 days was still 15M gas**. Obviously, validators will not magically be able to process transactions 10^50 times cheaper, so this is completely theoretical.\n\nNevertheless, the effect is there, and we have been experiencing a 20-40% decrease in gas prices quarterly since EIP-1559 was introduced in Aug 2021. \n\nA mix of these 2 cases will continue happening until a dynamic market equilibrium is reached:\n\n1. Gas price keeps falling every quarter\n1. Daily gas usage rises noticeably above its current 102% average.\n\nThis also means is that Ethereum can sustain higher than its 15M gas target in usage without increasing gas price.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>One interesting curiosity I&#39;ve noticed is that <strong>Ethereum gas prices have been falling 20-40% each quarter since EIP-1559 was introduced</strong> in Aug 2021.</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Quarter</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>Block Time</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>Gas % used</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>Observed TPS</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>Max TPS</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>Gas Price (Gwei)</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Notes</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2020 Q1</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">49%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">8</td>\n<td align=\"right\">15</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2020 Q2</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">61%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">10</td>\n<td align=\"right\">16</td>\n<td align=\"right\">40</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2020 Q3</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">78%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">16</td>\n<td align=\"right\">122</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2020 Q4</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">80%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">16</td>\n<td align=\"right\">66</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2021 Q1</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">80%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">14</td>\n<td align=\"right\">18</td>\n<td align=\"right\">150</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2021 Q2</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">92%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">16</td>\n<td align=\"right\">17</td>\n<td align=\"right\">87</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2021 Q3</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">99%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">14</td>\n<td align=\"right\">14</td>\n<td align=\"right\">67</td>\n<td align=\"left\">EIP-1559 starts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2021 Q4</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">102%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">15</td>\n<td align=\"right\">14</td>\n<td align=\"right\">117</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2022 Q1</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">101%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">14</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">95</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2022 Q2</td>\n<td align=\"right\">14</td>\n<td align=\"right\">101%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">12</td>\n<td align=\"right\">59</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2022 Q3</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">101%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">21</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2022 Q4</td>\n<td align=\"right\">12</td>\n<td align=\"right\">102%</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">13</td>\n<td align=\"right\">23</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Merge</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>It&#39;s counter-intuitive that gas price could keep falling each quarter despite being over the 100% 15M gas-target usage.

As usual, many theories and predictions pop up when the price goes up. On average these seem cautious at best and usually predict more downside. And that is fair, considering the macro situation, where more downside is the majority prediction.\n\nHow solid is the ETH price linked to macro though? If we take the s&p500, there is a clear correlation with eth. The drop to a flatish low in June/July, then back up with the same top in the middle of august followed by another valley, which we are currently climbing out of. A clear match, lots of correlation this year. Eth has a much higher amplitude, 8 to 10 times higher, depending on where you measure. That is very expected since eth is the smaller more volatile asset.\n\nHowever, if we just plot a magnified s&p 500 over the eth graph from several random starting points a clear pattern arises: eth is steadily outpacing this projection line. This is most easily seen at the recent higher low of sept/okt, where the s&p500 made a lower low instead.\n\nThe high noise levels prevent more exact modeling, but my guestimate is that currently eth price on a weekly timescale can be approximated by taking ~80% of a ~9 times magnified s&p 500 and adding 20% of a line rising by 500 per month.\n\nAs a predictive model this probably has no value, but I think splitting these components can be interesting. Does this show a combination of traders (mimicing macro) and accumulaters (steady buying)? It is a tempting theory. I am planning to keep an eye on these numbers, as the weeks go by to see if the presumed 80% correlation to macro will diminish.\n\nBecause if it does... Things will be different. A higher percentage will be allocated to the rising line. I have it here as a straight line, because there is no evidence for making this factor exponential at this time.

[This is what he said](https://www.quora.com/Does-Elon-Musk-do-some-very-technical-work-code-design-etc-at-SpaceX/answer/Josh-Boehm?ch=10&share=8dc8bc2e&srid=Xuwj) when asked about whether Elon Musk does very technical work at SpaceX:\n\n*Elon is both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer of SpaceX, so of course he does more than just \u2018some very technical work\u2019. He is integrally involved in the actual design and engineering of the rocket, and at least touches every other aspect of the business (but I would say the former takes up much more of his mental real estate). Elon is an engineer at heart, and that\u2019s where and how he works best.*\n\n**John Carmack, legendary software engineer**\n\n*Elon is definitely an engineer. He is deeply involved with technical decisions at spacex and Tesla. He doesn\u2019t write code or do CAD today, but he is perfectly capable of doing so.* [*https://twitter.com/ID\\_AA\\_Carmack/status/1038832124747571200*](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1038832124747571200)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And though you are skeptical about Elon himself, I'd still like to add this interview:**\n\n*Interviewer: What do you do when you\u2019re at SpaceX and Tesla? What does your time look like there?*\n\n*Elon: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design, so it\u2019s developing next-generation product. That\u2019s 80% of it.*\n\n*Interviewer: You probably don\u2019t remember this. A very long time ago, many, many, years, you took me on a tour of SpaceX. And the most impressive thing was that you knew every detail of the rocket and every piece of engineering that went into it. And I don\u2019t think many people get that about you.*\n\n*Elon: Yeah. I think a lot of people think I\u2019m kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it\u2019s like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it\u2019s working on the Model 3 and, yeah, so I\u2019m in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I\u2019ve had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Garrett Reisman on Elon Musk</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Reisman\">Garett Reisman</a> is an American engineer and former NASA austronaut.
