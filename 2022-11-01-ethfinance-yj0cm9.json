He positioned himself as the rational pragmatist as opposed to the crypto-native idealist / fundamentalist. It's a smart play to frame front-end regulation as a necessary compromise, without getting into the details of why it would make sense in the first place. I haven't really heard an argument for why it would be **good** regulation, only \"if we don't offer this, actual regulation will be worse\".\n\nSams argument was basically 1: That it's good strategy to offer something up to preserve something else and 2: That decentralized defi back-end is more important than decentralized defi front-end, so it's okay to give up the latter.\n\nBoth points felt unconvincing to me. Why is it good strategy to immediately give up something so fundamental? Why is this not a huge unforced error?\n\nAnd he didn't seem to get that both front-end and back-end are necessary conditions.
