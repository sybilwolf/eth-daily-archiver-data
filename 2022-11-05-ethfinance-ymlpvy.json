Recently I migrated to a Grid+ hardware wallet and it gave me a good opportunity to revisit what I did back in 2017 and apply more current best practices. There are plenty of good guides on what a private key is, how it relates to a mnemonic phrase, various hardware wallets, etc. That won't be the focus of this post. Instead, I want to walk through how I secure my assets and why.\n\nSome of the first guides I read on wallet security just said to store your private key whole. Engrave it in steel so it can't be lost in a fire, store it in a tamper evident device, store it in a vault, and if you need to back it up more potentially initialize multiple hardware wallets. At that time there was this contentious issue over the use of key fragments. To the uninitialized a key fragment approach is like a treasure map. You make two copies of the map, separate each copy into thirds, and store 2 unique parts in 3 different locations. Obviously, rather than being a map though this applies to your 24 word mnemonic phrase. The result looks as follows:\n\n| Location 1 | Location 2 | Location 3 |\n|------------|------------|------------|\n| 1-8 | | 1-8 |\n| 9-16 | 9-16 | |\n| | 17-24 | 17-24 |\n\nAny two fragments are sufficient to restore the map. This means that someone has to compromise two of your physical locations to steal your assets. This sounds good but some knowledgeable people like [Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5nSibpfHYE&ab_channel=aantonop) argued against the key fragment thing and said store the entire key together. The basic reasoning has to do with the time to brute force the unknown part of your key if any one fragment is still found. He argues you drop from 256 bits of security to 80 bits which, while not exactly easy to solve, is solvable by a determined attacker on the order of a decade. To me, with what I knew in 2017, I found a decade of brute force security a better trade off than having my entire security depend on a single location so I went ahead with it anyway. I setup my hardware wallet(s), split the key, sent the parts to different bank vaults geographically remote from one another, and would check on the parts every couple of years for tampering.\n\nThe upgrade to this plan is to secure the private key using [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme](https://github.com/dsprenkels/sss-cli). This accomplishes everything the scheme above does with the added advantage that if a fragment is lost it would still take an attacker until the heat death of the universe to brute force the rest. This is arguably better than something on the order of a decade. The downsides to this are that whomever is reconstructing the private key has to know it's Shamir's to have any idea what to do when provided some hash looking things and that these Shamir fragments aren't words and so are less resilient to damage and are harder to transcribe accurately.\n\nSo, how do I secure each Shamir fragment? Basically I follow all the original advice for storing mnemonics with a little extra leg work. In 2017 I used some crypto steel solutions. They are, without exception, more trouble than they are worth for what they do. What I suggest you do instead is find a few local steel engraving stores. These are most commonly used to generate plaques of team rosters that sit under trophies. A given plaque costs less than any of the crypto steel solutions I saw and won't come with transcription errors or an hour of fiddling with little steel plates. Instead, I turn the Shamir fragment into a QR code and put the hash fragment underneath it on the image I get engraved. Then I stick each of those onto a thumb drive, take it to some different stores, and buy a plate from each of them. The result fits in the smallest safety deposit box I could buy and is now resilient to fire and drive decay. You'd need a meteor big enough that my crypto holdings aren't my biggest concern before this system should fail. Even in that case, if I can access a hardware wallet like my Ledger backup I can still access that account and start this whole process over.\n\nIf all you're securing is a single private key that should have you covered. However, I had other things I wanted to secure alongside the private key (instructions to inheritors, multiple private keys, legal documents, etc). There's nothing saying that what you have to encrypt using Shamir's is the private key itself. So I Shamir'd the decryption key to a drive instead of the mnemonic to a single address. This is akin to using a password manager. There's a single secret that unlocks a set of secrets to each account. With this change you can secure a limitless data, backed up as many times as you want, in a nearly indestructible way.\n\nAll said and done, the least secure part of this system then is the hardware wallet and wrench attacks. On the former I'll encourage /u/jtnichol to comment on the security of the lattice and why it only has a 6 digit pin and the relative safety of their SafeCards and how they'd fit into this scheme. I'll edit this into a post for my website if no one pokes a good hole into it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So, since the time when I first setup my Ledger I&#39;ve had a few years to consider how I protect my private key.
