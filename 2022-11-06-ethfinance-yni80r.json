As a result of this they have little understanding of our core values and have stated in the past that all of the stake ought to be converted to their steth coin and also that [solo stakers aren't serious, and professionals like Lido should run the entire staking network](https://youtu.be/AZzEX_tl4QU). (Sorry for not sharing the exact timestamp, but listen to the whole thing and be prepared to shit your pants.) These ideals couldn't be farther from the actual design of the beacon chain, which was designed from the ground up for maximal decentralization and operation by many many independent validators running their own nodes. For this reason, [Lido has openly been regarded as a threat to the health of the Ethereum beacon chain](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd). \n\nOn the other hand, many independent operators ARE welcome on the beacon chain, with a focus on solo home stakers, and decentralized and trustless staking pools like Rocket pool. There's no real need to exclude Lido from the pool of validators, only to keep their influence in check when they believe they ought to be allowed to control the whole network.
