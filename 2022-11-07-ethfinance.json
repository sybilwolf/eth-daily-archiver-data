People in this sub were out for blood, calling Ethraider a scam artist, when it was clear to anyone who looked into the situation for more than a minute, that that wasn&#39;t the case at all.</p>\n\n<p>And now the turning on Polygon if it doesn&#39;t do exactly what the Ethereum community wants them to. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just very off-putting is all. At least to me.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: One thing I&#39;ll add too, and this is grey-ish as far as being relevant, but some of the backlash and vitriol I&#39;ve seen leveled at devs for software required to stake has been... well, stomach churning. I don&#39;t remember paying for any of this software. Other people made it available for me, and now I&#39;m making money because of it. People were acting like they were personally fucked over by these devs who needed to be available 24/7 for support and have since acted like these people need to get their act together before they can be trusted again. We&#39;re all experiencing this for the first time together, and we all know the risks.
