Things like, should you be going to school right now, or working to get on a stable foot before returning to your education? Are you solely responsible for your Mom? Can either of you ask for help, whether that's to people you know, or from the government? There must be things you guys can do to find a bit of stability.\n\nLast, I think the previous 10 years have given a lot of people the idea that investing (you said \"gambling,\" which is far more accurate) with crypto is a path to getting rich quick. In my opinion, those days are over. It sounds like you were in the money at some point, and since you need money, you probably should have settled with money, instead of gambling further. The hard reality of your situation is that right now crypto's in a bear winter. It's probably going to get worse. I don't say that to scare you, or make you more upset, but to set expectations.

I thought \"Man, I'll just do this again with another stock.\" Then I lost all 20k. It sucked, it was hard, but that's life. You can't win 'em all, and they aren't all easy to win.\n\nPersonally, I believe in ETH, and crypto, and I think in a few years time, if you hold on, you'll be glad you did. On the other hand, if you need the money now, sell what you have left. If you decide to get back in, I think you're going to find MUCH better prices next year. If that doesn't happen, well, again, you probably shouldn't be looking at crypto as the only way to save your life. Getting on stable footing, educate yourself, get a good job, and enjoy your youth. Most people don't find the sort of stability and comfort you're seeking until late 30's/40's.\n\nRe: suicide.
