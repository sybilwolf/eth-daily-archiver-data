I saw all the scams and all the grifters. Every youtube video about crypto was about how this and this coin would moon. Everyone that tried to sell me on crypto was talking about the money-go-up aspect of it. I saw the ICO-mania from a distance, heard about Bitconnect. Every big crypto personality that I saw was in a way offputting. Even if there was something to Bitcoin, it seemed to me like the bad far outweighed the good.\n\nThen in early 2021 I discovered that this group of open-minded enthusiasts were building a whole new financial system, one that is open and transparent and not in the control of any corruptible party or person. I read about public goods and using code as a tool to improve global co\u00f6rdination. I learned what it really means when a system is trustless. I listened to talks from people like Vitalik and Kevin Owocki. I found out about the Ethereum community and found the openness, the self criticism but most of all the optimism about the future.

What if you could open a collateralized position on something like Maker and then delegate it to a different address to draw from?

I doubt a company like FTX has enough goodwill for this to be an option, but they could always incentivize it in some way by giving tokens a la yield farming, or maybe just directly paying users for the option.

Maybe this reason alone is big enough to make this not useful in practice without some kind of incentive mechanism.
