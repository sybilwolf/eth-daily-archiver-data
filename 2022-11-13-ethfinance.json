The past few months I've just been going with the flow of the bear, in the sense that I've just not been super excited about things.\n\nJust spent time working, building, doing my job, which was very time consuming as well.\n\nBut another component was that I've been worried of being perceived as toxic. I called out Avalanche quite a lot. I've called out cardano on the day of their smart contract hard fork. I've called out people I believed were bad actors. And I've gotten pushback for that.\n\nWith a full time job in crypto, I was worried that if I kept doing that, it might hurt the company I work for or put me in a bad light. Nobody wants someone that constantly fights with other people or projects.\n\nBut I've now come to realize I should've been more vocal. I didn't even attempt to call out FTX, SBF, Jump, or others because they've been smart and relatively quiet. Not openly combative.\n\nOnly exception is multicoin, fuck those guys.\n\nI guess the old Swag is back now. I'm not watching these assholes come into this wonderful ecosystem where people are genuinely trying to do good, just to watch those other people ravage this land for all it's good for in the pursuit of money.\n\nI don't like you, I'll call your ass out.\n\nI've been watching Twitter accounts grow their followings to 5x mine just by playing the engagement game with all these actors. Always engaging. Always replying. Always saying \"gm king\" and sucking their dicks.\n\nI didn't do that because I didn't believe in them. Or, because I only believed in Ethereum.

The past few months I&#39;ve just been going with the flow of the bear, in the sense that I&#39;ve just not been super excited about things.</p>\n\n<p>Just spent time working, building, doing my job, which was very time consuming as well.</p>\n\n<p>But another component was that I&#39;ve been worried of being perceived as toxic. I called out Avalanche quite a lot. I&#39;ve called out cardano on the day of their smart contract hard fork. I&#39;ve called out people I believed were bad actors. And I&#39;ve gotten pushback for that.</p>\n\n<p>With a full time job in crypto, I was worried that if I kept doing that, it might hurt the company I work for or put me in a bad light. Nobody wants someone that constantly fights with other people or projects.</p>\n\n<p>But I&#39;ve now come to realize I should&#39;ve been more vocal. I didn&#39;t even attempt to call out FTX, SBF, Jump, or others because they&#39;ve been smart and relatively quiet. Not openly combative.</p>\n\n<p>Only exception is multicoin, fuck those guys.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the old Swag is back now. I&#39;m not watching these assholes come into this wonderful ecosystem where people are genuinely trying to do good, just to watch those other people ravage this land for all it&#39;s good for in the pursuit of money.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t like you, I&#39;ll call your ass out.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been watching Twitter accounts grow their followings to 5x mine just by playing the engagement game with all these actors. Always engaging. Always replying. Always saying &quot;gm king&quot; and sucking their dicks.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t do that because I didn&#39;t believe in them. Or, because I only believed in Ethereum. I won&#39;t sacrifice the values I stand for for twitter clout.</p>\n\n<p>If I have to be the toxic asshole that protects Ethereum values, then so be it.

By the end, some people were so invested in Sam&#39;s ecosystem that they lost everything.</p>\n\n<p>Prevailing wisdom here has been to only ever trade with a small portion of your stack, and to realize that the chances of coming out on top are likely worse than a regulated casino (at least they&#39;re required to post the odds). You can&#39;t make money if you don&#39;t have any coins left, so keep your ether safe frens.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-12 23:41:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iw6aw5q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yttcee","parent_id":"t3_yttcee","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Can confirm.

Sparing you the drama surrounding events related the FTX exchange, history has repeated itself again and unregulated, centralized entities have mishandled users' funds. Sadly numerous well-known and respected investors were affected by these recent events, and we remind our readers that expertise from other asset classes rarely translates effectively to the crypto space. Many institutions and professionals are keen to participate as the industry grows, but their understanding of crypto values and experience interacting directly with smart contracts and blockchain networks remains limited, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by persuasive con artists in this 'wild west' investing environment. It is unfortunate for victims when these events occur, but they must be expected as the chaotic innovation of crypto and rapid pace of growth will necessarily involve creative destruction events like those observed in free markets throughout history.\n\nAs part of our diversification strategy, at the beginning of the year we had a portion of stablecoin funds invested in fixed-yield products provided by centralized entities in the crypto ecosystem. Following the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin protocol LUNA in June and the associated contagion effects, all assets held with centralized lenders were removed into our custody. This measure was taken as a precaution against further contagion should the market continue downwards, but also to affirm our commitment to decentralized, permissionless protocols and platforms. Going forward, we anticipate 100% of funds will always be managed directly from wallets with private keys under our control. We maintain relationships with registered, credible firms to use as on-ramps and off-ramps with traditional banks to facilitate fiat deposits and withdrawals as needed.\n\nAs you should expect, we have avoided any direct losses from recent events but have unfortunately suffered some paper losses as widespread deleveraging has depressed asset prices across the industry. Our year-to-date performance has declined to -13%. \n\nOur outlook remains bearish heading into winter, as the effects of losses within the crypto space play out and global net liquidity remains constrained. It is probable that we have reached a local low and will see some upside price movement as crypto sentiment stabilizes, correlated with a bear-market rally in equity and commodity markets over the coming weeks. As we await the full effects of the impending global economic downturn, our expectation is that crypto will be the first market to signal a reversal in global liquidity when it becomes apparent that economic activity will require significant encouragement from central banks to resume growth in the form of stimulus and interest rate cuts. Base case expectation for this reversal is in the first few months of 2023, however confidence is low and hence we continue to plan for a wide range of market scenarios. \n\nWhile the crypto market remains depressed, we will continue to trend our positioning to best align with the long-term crypto bull case. Current exposure is 45% platform tokens and 55% stablecoins. We expect to trend towards 55/45 over the next few weeks, increasing further to 75/25 in early 2023 subject to material changes to our economic outlook, regulatory risk, and evolution in the crypto ecosystem. Our goal remains to capture maximum value growth when the market rises by buying when sentiment is depressed while minimizing losses during declines, recognizing our limited ability to predict price movements in the short term.\n\nThe majority of funds remain invested in yield-bearing smart contracts, providing liquidity and security to open protocols. Overall yield is estimated at 34% APY. Should crypto markets remain relatively flat over the medium-term, we may recover our losses to-date within 6 months.\n\nWe all await the coming of the next crypto bull market with great excitement, but must remember the patience needed to get there and keep in mind that as long as new powerful tools continue to be developed and deployed as open-source, permissionless, decentralized, anti-fragile protocols and networks, the prospects for value accretion and wealth creation remain as bright as they were when we began this journey.\n\nTrust code, not people.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMe","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As a sort of therapy, I wrote myself a letter as if I was investing other peoples money.</p>\n\n<p>Fall 2022 Portfolio Update.</p>\n\n<p>Dear investors,</p>\n\n<p>As crypto is making headlines again, in the interest of keeping you informed we are providing an update on your portfolio.

Let me take a personal loan from SoFi or a non-crypto entity as well at this point that at least has public accountability and a level of maturity and has a far less likelihood of blowing up or getting hacked. one has to ask the hard question at some point - what problem is crypto actually solving for the broader market? in it&#39;s current state and trajectory is there value being made beyond just being a store of wealth and a playground for whales? I&#39;ve stopped being plugged in with crypto since beginning of the year and I&#39;ve never had the thought once &quot;Oh wow I&#39;ve got to use this really good crypto protocol/service that will provide me with convenience/value/new way of doing things/make my life easier.&quot; &#39;Tis what it is and I can guarantee you is how a majority of non-crypto folks feel.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-13 07:36:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iw7h4gy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yttcee","parent_id":"t3_yttcee","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Canadiens1993","body":"Sounds like opportunity to me.
