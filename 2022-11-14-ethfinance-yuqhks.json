Only in tradfi they are under the control of a small group of value extractors. There is no equal opportunity in investment  or managing of wealth.\n\nIt is my take that crypto can democratize these instruments and bring them to everyone. It's not more capitalistic, it's capitalism that works for everyone. I would be the first to agree that this is an ideal and we are in the middle of a very messy process. Defi needs to really decentralize, CeFi needs to be properly regulated and the general public needs to be financially educated.

I guess it&#39;s good to acknowledge all of the ways the broader crypto space has been negative for the general public and that so much of it is hot air, scams and grifters, but I already knew all of that was bad and we try calling that shit out where we see it too.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the fundamental disagreement is with her take that crypto = hypercapitalism and that&#39;s always going to be bad. She didn&#39;t really explain this take further, I think it seems self evident to her (just look at all the scams and hacks), but a really strong argument for why crypto = hypercapitalism = bad is what I would really want to hear.</p>\n\n<p>To me it feels like we are already living in a capitalistic society where money and financial instruments are embedded in every layer. Only in tradfi they are under the control of a small group of value extractors. There is no equal opportunity in investment  or managing of wealth.</p>\n\n<p>It is my take that crypto can democratize these instruments and bring them to everyone. It&#39;s not more capitalistic, it&#39;s capitalism that works for everyone. I would be the first to agree that this is an ideal and we are in the middle of a very messy process. Defi needs to really decentralize, CeFi needs to be properly regulated and the general public needs to be financially educated. Maybe this is too idealistic, but this is the fundamental value that crypto can bring to society imo.</p>\n\n<p>David and Ryan really missed an opportunity when she was talking about Wikipedia. She said she was intrinsically motivated by bringing access to knowledge to everyone worldwide. Knowledge is empowering. The Bankless mission is to bring access to financial instruments and property rights to everyone. Self custody is also empowering</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-14 10:53:58","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-11-14 11:03:20","id":"iwcz2h8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yuqhks","parent_id":"t1_iwcvk8j","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/dondochaka","body":"> but a really strong argument for why crypto = hypercapitalism = bad is what I would really want to hear  \n\nI would like to hear about this too.

This info taken from the CIA website provides some stark indicators. https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/taiwan/\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/taiwan-military-training-overhaul-not-be-enough-to-fight-china-2021-11 mentions a few important points.\n\n1. Taiwan is to overhaul the training for its military reservists as it attempts to improve a training system that has faced widespread criticism for producing \"strawberry soldiers\" who are fragile and easily crushed.\n\n2. Liao said new conscripts underwent five weeks of basic training at a cadet centre before being assigned to a military base for 11 weeks of further training....He said the basic training was carried out in a rush and conscripts were not given time to understand the things they were being taught.\n\n3. Under the new measures, some reservists will be required to spend 14 days a year on refresher training courses, up to from the present five to seven days.\n\n4. Reservists who are called up will be required to more than double the amount of bullets they fire in shooting drills while combat training will be extended from half a day to 56 hours.\n\nTo put it lightly, this is woefully insufficient. Taiwan has extremely strict weapons laws, and the effects even spill over into the military. They practice predominantly with airsoft 'guns'. As someone with firearms experience, lemme just say *holy fucking shit*.\n\nAt least there is a strong uptick in Taiwanese civilians seeking out further tactical training, of course, performed with airsoft guns.\n\nEDIT: Adding that this will be China's first test of its military in modern history. They may be very well trained and disciplined. There is also the chance that they flop as hard as Russia. With no fighting experience, we shall see.\n\nThe population and geographical size disparity between China and Taiwan will obviously be of critical importance. Though, much like the Ryukyu Islands, there are no shortage of safe places to hide.\n\nLets now discuss why the abilities of their military may not even be a large factor. Lets discuss some things that Taiwan has going for it, in terms of global leverage.\n\nBiden has stated that the US will come to the defense of Taiwan in the event of an invasion by China. What exactly that means, who knows.\n\nBut make no mistake, *every* country not currently aligned with China will be incentivized to defend Taiwan. We all know that Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing capability *must* be safeguarded.\n\nTo cause massive worldwide destruction, China would not have to succeed in taking over Taiwan. They simply need to limit/eradicate Taiwan's ability to manufacture.\n\nThe US military, and many others, will do everything in its power to prevent Taiwan from falling, including direct intervention. The alternative is to watch as China consolidates itself as the world's only computer manufacturer and distributor.\n\nHere's where we introduce the catch-22. Suppose the US steps over whatever boundary China makes.\n\nChina's first move will likely be to halt export of pharmaceutical products to the US. https://medium.com/pharmacychecker/which-u-s-medications-are-manufactured-in-china-ed6b551ae14f demonstrates just how devastating this would be to the health of Americans, and their ability to defend Taiwan.\n\nI expect that information warfare, and especially cyber warfare, will play the largest role in any conflict to date. The US, in an attempt to avoid physical confrontation with the Chinese, will be pulling out *all the stops* of their cyber capabilities. Lots of information regarding exploitation of Chinese equipment will be passed along to Taiwan for their own use, as well. \n\nWith the assistance of the existing US military presence in the area, the Japanese military will be rapidly funded and trained to once again be a formidable fighting force. \n\nAnd they're going to need to if they want to survive the chaos that North Korea will likely be creating.\n\nUS military presence in South Korea will also increase dramatically. \n\nWe will likely see a massive scaling of manufacturing capabilities in the US, much like during WWII. The money printers will be turned up to a level we have not seen before. Unemployment figures will likely be extremely low, even though dollars will not buy much.\n\nRegulatory oversight, particularly environmental, will take the back seat. Rather, they'll be locked in a soundproof trunk.\n\nGlobal markets will of course be in the gutter, much more so than currently.\n\nUnfortunately, I am positive we will see political gamesmanship by US figures(both parties) as they desperately cling to power, much to the expense of the world.\n\nSurveillance and tyranny will see a remarkable uptick in the US, as we always see with these types of events.\n\nI wish I could say 'and all these factors are exactly why Ethereum will instantly become recognized as the global settlement layer'.\n\nI see it as a remote possibility as trust is eroded in traditional institutions.\n\nMight ETH emerge as a relatively strong hedge against inflation the likes of which we haven't seen? Possibly.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Alright <a href=\"/u/MrVodnik\">/u/MrVodnik</a> if this gets deleted its on you /s</p>\n\n<p>Trigger warning for those who hate off topic posts.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of an invasion of Taiwan by China, I expect many fundamental shifts in the way our world currently functions.</p>\n\n<p>For reference, this was written from the perspective of an American, with a heavy emphasis on how it might affect the US.
