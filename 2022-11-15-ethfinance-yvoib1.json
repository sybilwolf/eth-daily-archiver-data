Absolutely no one bat an eye over the FTX implosion. They have their technical reasons for wanting to use blockchain technology, SBF is irrelevant to them. It&#39;s like saying Twitter broke because of 2FA we should all stop using it. It&#39;s a ridiculous statement that only makes sense if you&#39;re ignorant of both the technology and the circumstances of why the failure happened.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-15 13:47:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iwihm4n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yvoib1","parent_id":"t1_iwia1o5","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"Following up on my [last comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/yvoib1/comment/iwgt6xr/) about compiling a list of KYC leaks to draw attention to the harm they cause:\n\n* **Tokensoft** \\- 11/12/2022 - 5k users affected (full names, wallet address, home address)\n   * [https://coinlive.me/personal-data-of-tokensoft-airdrop-participants-leaked-26758.html](https://coinlive.me/personal-data-of-tokensoft-airdrop-participants-leaked-26758.html)\n* **Celsius** \\- 10/07/2022 - 600k users affected (full names, balances, wallet addresses, balances, transactions)\n   * [https://cryptoslate.com/horrendous-kyc-risks-on-show-as-website-detailing-celsius-users-losses-goes-live/](https://cryptoslate.com/horrendous-kyc-risks-on-show-as-website-detailing-celsius-users-losses-goes-live/)\n* **Digitex** \\- 02/29/2020 - 8k users affected (passport, driving license, home address, phone number, IP address)\n   * [https://cointelegraph.com/news/digileaker-claims-to-have-stolen-kyc-documents-for-8-000-digitex-users](https://cointelegraph.com/news/digileaker-claims-to-have-stolen-kyc-documents-for-8-000-digitex-users)\n* **Binance** \\- 8/7/2019 - 10k users affected (full name, photo, driving license, passport)\n   * [https://thehackernews.com/2019/08/binance-kyc-data-leak.html](https://thehackernews.com/2019/08/binance-kyc-data-leak.html)\n* **DADI ICO** \\- 03/12/2018 - unknown amount affected (full name, home address, DOB, photo)\n   * [https://bitcoinist.com/dadi-ico-investors-become-targets-phishing-scams-amid-reports-data-leak/](https://bitcoinist.com/dadi-ico-investors-become-targets-phishing-scams-amid-reports-data-leak/)\n* **Bittrex** \\- 12/2017 - unknown amount affected (full name, photo, passport)\n   * [https://cointelegraph.com/news/bittrex-leaks-user-passports-in-support-emails-says-russian-telegram-channel](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bittrex-leaks-user-passports-in-support-emails-says-russian-telegram-channel)\n\n\\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* HubSpot -  was kyc info leaked here?\n   * Affected Circle, BlockFi, Pantera Capital, NYDIG and others\n   * [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/how-hubspot-data-breach-hits-bitcoiners](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/how-hubspot-data-breach-hits-bitcoiners)\n* MtGox - - was kyc info leaked here?\n* Ledger - as u/nixorokish pointed out this was a point of sales data leak, the info was not acquired for kyc purposes\n\n\\---\n\nAny other KYC leaks?

But just keep in mind that the different liquidaiton ratios mean that at the same amount of ETH supplied and DAI borrowed, you&#39;ll have different liquidation prices on each of these vaults.</p>\n\n<p>But then we also have another trick in the DFS toolbox - you can, for example, open an ETH-C Vault now and in case the market takes a noticeable dive during your borrowing period, you can convert the ETH-C Vault into an ETH-B one using our &quot;Loan Shifter&quot;. The process uses a flash loan to clear your initial debt and move your collateral to a new vault, where the same amount is then re-borrowed to clear the flash loan. And, more importantly, the process doesn&#39;t involve any fees outside of the transaction fee to submit the transaction, so pretty handy.</p>\n\n<p>Again, definitely suggest checking out all of this in simulation mode as it really shows you all the steps and transactions involved, and it also gives you a good estimate of tx fees (at current gas prices!) for all the needed transactions.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll likely be heading to catch some sleep now, but will gladly reply to any additional questions first thing in the morning - or just any time in the future, of course.
