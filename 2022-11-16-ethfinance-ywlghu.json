I just knew that&#39;s the concern Set1less was referring to because <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ys2p95/daily_general_discussion_november_11_2022/ivyg7y0/\">they brought it up a few days ago</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s also why I explicitly said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I kinda feel this is a bit of an extreme and unlikely fallout scenario</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Still, it&#39;s fair to say you can&#39;t <em>completely</em> trust anything that requires custody these days. Safest is to enter full Cypherpunk mode--not your keys, not your coins. I still do personally hold some custody coins as a part of my risk profile, but the are a small part of it, and I completely appreciate those who do not hold any.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-16 06:33:44","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-11-16 06:53:13","id":"iwldwz8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ywlghu","parent_id":"t1_iwlcvdr","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/barthib","body":"For who?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For who?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-16 05:58:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iwl9d89","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ywlghu","parent_id":"t1_iwl8b5k","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-16 11:47:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iwmo7tg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ywlghu","parent_id":"t3_ywlghu","score":-4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SmellyMammoths","body":"pretty sure that url is a scam and not the actual Porsche NFT charity auction.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>pretty sure that url is a scam and not the actual Porsche NFT charity auction.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-16 11:58:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iwmptun","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ywlghu","parent_id":"t1_iwmo7tg","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-16 02:20:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iwkpf9z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ywlghu","parent_id":"t3_ywlghu","score":0,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-16 02:31:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iwkq6w2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ywlghu","parent_id":"t1_iwkpf9z","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Beef_Lamborghinion","body":"Liquity, because it\u2019s fully decentralized, immutable and battle tested.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Liquity, because it\u2019s fully decentralized, immutable and battle tested.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-16 03:06:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iwkslcw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ywlghu","parent_id":"t1_iwkpf9z","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Genesis fell, Gemini with it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Genesis fell, Gemini with it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-16 05:43:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iwl7jqm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ywlghu","parent_id":"t3_ywlghu","score":-6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/REALJohnBMacLemore","body":"Easy.
