It was an incredibly-dense 2-hour panel, and **I learned more from it than from the dozens of other recent news reports combined**. This is likely the best insider details you'll get before the Netflix documentary.\n\nHere's the 5-minute summary of the most important points:\n\n####**Key points**:\n\n**SBF had a backdoor into FTX's book-keeping system** (11:00-12:00): He could execute orders/transfers that would not alerts auditors or internal employees. [Secondary source](https://fortune.com/2022/11/16/sbf-dangerous-decision-making-philosophy-brought-down-ftx-investing-leadership-behavior-gleb-tsipursky/). He used this to secretly transfer funds between Alameda and FTX.\n\n**Breaking down SBF's pump-and-collateralize strategy that he used over 30 times** (15:30-21:30)\n\n* **The traditional pump-dump strategy** for ICOs was to create a coin, pump it, and then dump it. The downside is that you could only do this once, and if you're caught, you get into massive trouble.\n* **SBF's strategy** was to create a coin, pump it, and then collateralize it. He did this ~35 times\n* These shitcoins (e.g. FTT, SRM, APT, and 30 others you've never heard of) were on multi-year hyperinflationary schedule with an extremely small liquidity at the beginning. They were designed so that staking rewards were massive in the beginning, leading to many early investors rushing to get into them. This lead to a giant pump.\n* They were taking loans based on the value of these tokens early on. The tokens were meant to lose value over time, but not before they took the \"overcollateralized\" loans.\n* All CeFi companies were giving loans based on the **pumped-up value** of these FTX shitcoins. It was similar to the subprime loan situation, but worse. With subprime loans, both the lender and the borrower lose during default. With shitcoin-collateralized loans, only the lender would lose out.\n* For CeFi companies, there were only a few originating customers borrowing loans: mainly Alameda and 3AC. When 3AC went down, the CeFi companies could only turn to Alameda Research. And that's why they stuck with them.\n* **CeFi companies misled their retail customers** about their collateralized loans because the value of their collateral from FTX/Alameda kept going down over time. It was against their interest to liquidate Alameda or regularly adjust their loan-to-value as should've been doing because they would lose their only borrowing customer. Without Alameda, retail customers would get no interest and would leave.\n\n**Why the scheme failed in the long run** (21:30): Due to collateral, they needed to keep the value of their shitcoins and FTT up above a certain value or be liquidated. For FTT, this was around $22. When no one wanted to buy FTT anymore, FTX/Alameda had to buy it themselves at a loss. We know this because CEO Caroline Ellison Tweeted this offer, and because they kept FTT right above this critical level for half a year. Otherwise, loan liquidations would start, and the scheme would collapse like a house of cards. (The podcast doesn't mention it here, but that made SBF's model a Ponzi scheme. It could not run forever.)\n\n**Alameda's insider connections with FTX** (23:00-25:00): Alameda was buying up FTX shitcoins before they were listed on FTX. They had insider knowledge about supply circulation and manipulate it together. Projects had to partner with Alameda in order to be listed on FTX.\n\n**FTX did not have a CFO or board members** (26:45-30:00): They paid their employees poorly and churned through employees. It was controlled by an inner circle of 4 core members (in a polyamorous relationship) at their retreat in the Bahamas. There was massive divided between what the inner circle knew and what the rest of the employees knew.\n\n**VCs that invested in FTX ignored basic auditing and failed at risk management** (35:30-38:00): Many  giant traditional VC investors (e.g. Blackrock, Sequoia, Coinbase Co-Founder's Paradigm) in FTX never required financial basics with FTX. One of the VCs that did due diligence, Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital, asked for FTX to get auditors from the big 4 and board members, and SBF told him to fuck off.\n\n**Hasseb of Dragonfly reveals his own story** (37:45-39:00): about how Dragonfly walked away from a deal with SBF back when he was head of Alameda because they thought Sam was shady when he kept changing the deal. SBF avoided Dragonfly afterwards.\n\n**Discussion about SBF's combined system as a Ponzi Scheme** (59:45 - 101:00:30): If Alameda and FTX were run completely separately, it wouldn't have been a Ponzi. But they worked together to manipulate the price of FTT and had to keep it above a certain value for as long as they could to remain stable. They used FTT as collateral to borrow more. Once the price of FTT fell below that level, loans liquidated and it all collapsed like a house of cards.\n\n**One reason for lack of auditing** (105:00:00 - 106:00:00): FTX grew during the pandemic. VCs and auditors could not do full audits by visiting offices. It was all over online meetings.\n\n-----------------\n\nI know there are some industry experts and insiders who frequently visit **ethfinance**.

Because of the security and traceability of the Blockchain, many governments are looking into (or already have) blockchain-based digital currencies, or \u201cCBDCs.\u201d\n\nEx: My father-in-law can send DAI to his relatives in S. America as a safe haven versus the worthless currency of his home country. Not to mention international transfers being much cheaper.\n\nEx: You can borrow against crypto assets with DeFi and deposit that fiat right in your trad-fi bank account. \n\n**Web3 decentralization**: Empowers access that isn't governed by a few tech corporation interests and puts power in the hands of individuals.\n\nWeb 2.0 requires content creators to trust platforms not to change the rules, but censorship resistance is a native feature of a Web3 platform. On Web3, your data lives on the blockchain. When you decide to leave a platform, you can take your reputation with you, plugging it into another interface that more clearly aligns with your values.\n\nEx: [iExec](https://iex.ec/) provides you confidential computing.\n\nEx: Facebook vs [Deso.com](https://signup.deso.com/explore) or [caches.xyz](http://caches.xyz) or [Lens](https://lenster.xyz). Reddit avatars are NFTs in the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\nEx: Achievement awards for participating in notable events via [POAPs](https://poap.xyz/).\n\n**Enhanced Digital Rights and Ownership**: Truly own the rights to your digital music, videos, and video game experience.\n\n**Artists**: Crypto can reorganize the entire way we view ownership and work. The data commodity is something we are all putting work into everyday. Crypto allows you access to an economy where the value is derived from an artist\u2019s work rather than subscription fees to Spotify, etc. paying fractions of pennies on the dollar to the artist. There is also more opportunity for musicians to sell their merchandise and music directly to their fan bases rather than depending on platforms as an intermediary. The blockchain allows you to see who is interacting with and collecting your work.\n\nEx: https://www.sound.xyz/\n\nEx: https://anotherblock.io/\n\n**Gaming**: I think this is where we really take off with blockchain adoption. Allows you to continue to own in-game items and trade them to others recouping their value. You bought a digital version of the game for the full price? Guess what, now you can trade it to someone else using Blockchain technology. Large gaming industries are looking into this because of the profits they would see on the secondary 'used' game market as well.\n\n**Retail**: Nike, Adidas, Dolce & Gabbana, Tiffany and Gucci are using crypto to circumvent the sales of immitation or counterfeit products by assigning a Blockchain address to [exclusive lines](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-becomes-highest-earning-brand-085014745.html) of products. Nike and [Starbucks](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/12/starbucks-unveils-its-blockchain-based-loyalty-platform-and-nft-community-starbucks-odyssey/) have both recently adopted NFT rewards and integration into their respective businesses. [Instagram](https://www.forbes.com/sites/phoebeliu/2022/08/12/instagram-meta-nfts-crash/?sh=33692ce04150) has integrated blockchain tech. Twitter allows you to [tip/pay](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tips) anyone on their platform with crypto.Christie\u2019s Auction house 3.0 allows for auctions to be carried out on the Ethereum blockchain network from start to finish. All transactions, including post-sale, will be automatically recorded on the blockchain.\n\n**Smart Contracts in Every Industry (Legal):** Potential to function as [legally binding contracts](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/smart-contracts-legally-binding) \u2014 the kind that inform most of today\u2019s business engagements. This extends to housing and mortgage as well. Technology has been driving innovation in the legal industry, most recently with the advent of e-signatures for binding legal agreements. Smart contracts represent another new development in this space, and may soon be an option for parties to legal agreements, potentially lowering the costs incurred from using lawyers and other intermediaries. Smart contracts are secure, automated, and trustless. \n\nEx: Arizona allows enforceable legal agreements to be created via smart contracts, and California allows marriage licenses to be issued via blockchain technology.\n\n**Healthcare**: Health networks are using private permissioned blockchains to share homomorphic encrypted patient data, so researchers can access patient data while the network can preserve patient privacy. Some countries are using Blockchain tech to track Covid vaccine distribution and patient immunization records.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n1. None of this is possible in a centralized database.

Because of the security and traceability of the Blockchain, many governments are looking into (or already have) blockchain-based digital currencies, or \u201cCBDCs.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ex: My father-in-law can send DAI to his relatives in S. America as a safe haven versus the worthless currency of his home country. Not to mention international transfers being much cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>Ex: You can borrow against crypto assets with DeFi and deposit that fiat right in your trad-fi bank account. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Web3 decentralization</strong>: Empowers access that isn&#39;t governed by a few tech corporation interests and puts power in the hands of individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Web 2.0 requires content creators to trust platforms not to change the rules, but censorship resistance is a native feature of a Web3 platform. On Web3, your data lives on the blockchain. When you decide to leave a platform, you can take your reputation with you, plugging it into another interface that more clearly aligns with your values.</p>\n\n<p>Ex: <a href=\"https://iex.ec/\">iExec</a> provides you confidential computing.</p>\n\n<p>Ex: Facebook vs <a href=\"https://signup.deso.com/explore\">Deso.com</a> or <a href=\"http://caches.xyz\">caches.xyz</a> or <a href=\"https://lenster.xyz\">Lens</a>. Reddit avatars are NFTs in the Ethereum virtual machine.</p>\n\n<p>Ex: Achievement awards for participating in notable events via <a href=\"https://poap.xyz/\">POAPs</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enhanced Digital Rights and Ownership</strong>: Truly own the rights to your digital music, videos, and video game experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Artists</strong>: Crypto can reorganize the entire way we view ownership and work. The data commodity is something we are all putting work into everyday. Crypto allows you access to an economy where the value is derived from an artist\u2019s work rather than subscription fees to Spotify, etc. paying fractions of pennies on the dollar to the artist. There is also more opportunity for musicians to sell their merchandise and music directly to their fan bases rather than depending on platforms as an intermediary. The blockchain allows you to see who is interacting with and collecting your work.</p>\n\n<p>Ex: <a href=\"https://www.sound.xyz/\">https://www.sound.xyz/</a></p>\n\n<p>Ex: <a href=\"https://anotherblock.io/\">https://anotherblock.io/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gaming</strong>: I think this is where we really take off with blockchain adoption. Allows you to continue to own in-game items and trade them to others recouping their value. You bought a digital version of the game for the full price? Guess what, now you can trade it to someone else using Blockchain technology. Large gaming industries are looking into this because of the profits they would see on the secondary &#39;used&#39; game market as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Retail</strong>: Nike, Adidas, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Tiffany and Gucci are using crypto to circumvent the sales of immitation or counterfeit products by assigning a Blockchain address to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-becomes-highest-earning-brand-085014745.html\">exclusive lines</a> of products. Nike and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/12/starbucks-unveils-its-blockchain-based-loyalty-platform-and-nft-community-starbucks-odyssey/\">Starbucks</a> have both recently adopted NFT rewards and integration into their respective businesses. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/phoebeliu/2022/08/12/instagram-meta-nfts-crash/?sh=33692ce04150\">Instagram</a> has integrated blockchain tech. Twitter allows you to <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tips\">tip/pay</a> anyone on their platform with crypto.Christie\u2019s Auction house 3.0 allows for auctions to be carried out on the Ethereum blockchain network from start to finish. All transactions, including post-sale, will be automatically recorded on the blockchain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smart Contracts in Every Industry (Legal):</strong> Potential to function as <a href=\"https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/smart-contracts-legally-binding\">legally binding contracts</a> \u2014 the kind that inform most of today\u2019s business engagements. This extends to housing and mortgage as well. Technology has been driving innovation in the legal industry, most recently with the advent of e-signatures for binding legal agreements. Smart contracts represent another new development in this space, and may soon be an option for parties to legal agreements, potentially lowering the costs incurred from using lawyers and other intermediaries. Smart contracts are secure, automated, and trustless. </p>\n\n<p>Ex: Arizona allows enforceable legal agreements to be created via smart contracts, and California allows marriage licenses to be issued via blockchain technology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Health networks are using private permissioned blockchains to share homomorphic encrypted patient data, so researchers can access patient data while the network can preserve patient privacy. Some countries are using Blockchain tech to track Covid vaccine distribution and patient immunization records.</p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>None of this is possible in a centralized database. It has to be decentralized on a Blockchain in order for it to work. Otherwise, you&#39;re right that we could just use a centralized database like Google or Apple; granting them unlimited ability to sell and profit off of our private data and virtual print.
