Sorry that I don't have time to finish writing this today.**\n\nIt's been a little more than a year and a half since I self-custodied my own assets. As of yesterday though, I am back to 100% full self-custody in my hardware wallet. I've been in the space since 2013, and I've always believed strongly in the manta \"Not your keys, not your crypto\" considering the shit I've seen, but over the last couple of years, I lost this perspective.\n\nLet me take a quick aside and say that I've come close to having lost everything even with self-custody. I've been the target of SIM Swapping, and have had a Trezor break on me with the seed phrase lost- somehow was able to come through okay from both of these events. Okay, onto the story...\n\nIn the past year and a half I've lent my ETH into programs where, b/c I was a big enough account, \"institutional-only\" lending platforms (e.g. Genesis, among others). I was given white glove service, including sometimes multiple account reps and whole teams of people on Telegram answering my needs 24/7.\n\nInitially, I was extremely scared to move my assets anywhere. I was comfortable doing self-custody, having done it since 2013. I had memorized my 24-word seed phrase and I didn't trust anyone in the space- not even Coinbase. But once I started seeing monthly income roll in that wasn't tied to my job, and the stress of self-custody lifted, with \"an institutional grade provider,\" I felt like I hacked the game.  It truly was a game changer.  Let me also add that when your crypto is 99%+ of your net worth, and represents more money than your whole family + extended family combined, self-custodying *will* make you go a little crazy too.\n\nI found out that I loved all the benefits of this approach. I received the flexibility of having my ETH still available to me, no-self custody headache, monthly income, higher yields than staking, yield in dollars (if needed) among many other benefits. It was actually hard *not* to fall in love with it.\n\nBut slowly, I found myself chasing yield. What I considered was less risky with higher yield, was actually higher risk and ultimately led me to collecting nickels in front of the FTX and 3AC steamroller.\n\nIn the past month, I somehow dodged multiple bazooka rocket sized bullets and got very lucky each time. I may or may not go into each due to privacy reasons in Part 2, but just know that I came very close to losing 100% of my funds multiple times, but I survived. The Crypto Gods spared me, despite my greed - and if we know anything about the Crypto Gods, it's that they punish Greed the hardest. If I had taken on leverage, I would have been stuck with these exchanges and my funds would have surely been lost. I did not come out unscathed though....\n\nMore to come in part 2 in the coming days.
