To me, Eigenlayer is the most exciting upcoming project on etheruem, and I'll try to breakdown why I think so (mostly to clarify my own thinking, so do correct me if I'm wrong)\n\n\nCurrently, ethereum network is the dominant settlement layer in web3. And it's secured by ETH. But another, probably better way to describe the role of Ethereum, is in providing a *decentralised source of trust*.\n\n\nSo how do you access this decentralised source of trust? By building on top of the Ethereum network, and tapping into it's blockspace. In return, you pay fees for having access to one of the most pristine sources of trust on the Internet. So smart contracts running on Ethereum and L2s built on etheruem tap into this.\n\n\nBut EigenLayer provides a completely *additional marketplace to access* Ethereum's decentralised layer of trust. You could be an oracle, a new bridge, a fancy execution layer, not directly running on Ethereum and bounded by the EVM, but secured by restaked ETH provided by Eigenlayer or other similar implementations. And you now have access to the trust network offered by ETH, in whatever proportion you think your application needs (and in turn which determines how much yield you pay for validators). Before, you'd have to try to bootstrap your own trust layer (settlement layer) by each service issuing endless tokens of it's own, and hoping retail is stupid enough to buy it.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother way I think of this change: Imagine there was a rare superfood made by tribesmen only found deep in the Amazon. It's highly beneficial but can't be transferred over long distances because it breaks down. So you need to be in the vicinity of the Amazon, maybe in medical hotels and villages, to benefit from this superfood. And the tribesmen who make it get paid a decent amount given the legit demand. But now, you find a new way to transport this food under cold storage, and build marketplaces for it in every city in the world. Imagine how much the value proposition of the food goes up by, and the exponentially larger market reached by the superfood. (P.s. this analogy only describes how eigenlayer increases the marketplace to access ethereum's layer of trust. It doesn't fully capture the uniqueness of the etheruem network - it doesn't have an easy susbtitutable product unlike a superfood, as we have seen other L1s crash and burn. It also doesn't capture how essential the settlement layer is to the on-chain economy, unlike perhaps a superfood)\n\n\nTo me, this is one of the most profound improvements to the value proposition of ETH, and I would rank them as follows\n\n\n1. Shift to PoS - formalised ETH as the token securing the network, dramatically reduces emissions and almost entirely removes forced structural selling for miner opex\n\n\n2. Eip1559 - linked demand for ETH the asset, to demand for ethereum blockspace, which in turn reflects the economic activity occuring on ethereum\n\n\n3. Eigenlayer and other Eth re-staking solutions - Enables far more applications/solutions in web3 to tap into the decentralised source of trust offered by the etheruem network. Is also the only one out of the 3 which isn't a core protocol change.\u00a0\n\n\n[Expected shipping date is meant to be mid 2023](https://twitter.com/sreeramkannan/status/1592774210317070336), and apparently doesn't need withdrawals/Shanghai to be shipped first.

(P.s. this analogy only describes how eigenlayer increases the marketplace to access ethereum&#39;s layer of trust. It doesn&#39;t fully capture the uniqueness of the etheruem network - it doesn&#39;t have an easy susbtitutable product unlike a superfood, as we have seen other L1s crash and burn. It also doesn&#39;t capture how essential the settlement layer is to the on-chain economy, unlike perhaps a superfood)</p>\n\n<p>To me, this is one of the most profound improvements to the value proposition of ETH, and I would rank them as follows</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Shift to PoS - formalised ETH as the token securing the network, dramatically reduces emissions and almost entirely removes forced structural selling for miner opex</p></li>\n<li><p>Eip1559 - linked demand for ETH the asset, to demand for ethereum blockspace, which in turn reflects the economic activity occuring on ethereum</p></li>\n<li><p>Eigenlayer and other Eth re-staking solutions - Enables far more applications/solutions in web3 to tap into the decentralised source of trust offered by the etheruem network. Is also the only one out of the 3 which isn&#39;t a core protocol change.\u00a0</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sreeramkannan/status/1592774210317070336\">Expected shipping date is meant to be mid 2023</a>, and apparently doesn&#39;t need withdrawals/Shanghai to be shipped first.

But I guess there&#39;s also an argument to be made that Ethereum has the best of both worlds like this, staking yield is more accessible through these providers and we keep it fully permissionless by not needing any kind of reputation mechanism directly on L1, but still get reputation to play a role via which provider people opt for - if one gets slashed, only their customers are affected. It&#39;s good that the yield is more accessible, but not so good that someone able and willing to run an actual validator to directly participate in consensus can be still be priced out.</p>\n\n<p>I often think what it&#39;d be like to enshrine rocketpool&#39;s liquid staking model directly on L1. Node operators still have their own money on the line first and foremost, and we get a purely neutral liquid staking tokens against which other LSDs have to compete (and it wouldnt be a fair or easy fight).</p>\n\n<p>But in the end it&#39;s complex, risky and very difficult to modify L1 so it&#39;s better to leave the problem solving to higher-level solutions. I&#39;m super bullish on the ones making running an actual node more accessible, like RocketPool and distributed validator tech. Throw some proof-of-humanity in the mix and we could even bring the capital barrier of running a validator down to 0! Imagine just running software and getting a commission on the yield generated by the ETH you&#39;re staking. Like mining but better, and super beneficial for the security+decentralization of the chain</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-19 20:21:57","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-11-19 20:32:08","id":"ix27u97","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yz4znw","parent_id":"t1_ix230nw","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/HarryZKE","body":"yeah a rocketpool at the base layer would be sweet","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>yeah a rocketpool at the base layer would be sweet</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-19 21:38:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ix2ff0e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yz4znw","parent_id":"t1_ix27u97","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pa7x1","body":"Unfortunately, too close to being a security.
