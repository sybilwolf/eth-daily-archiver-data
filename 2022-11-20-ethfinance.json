Dozens of tokens and DeFi swap have been used. Some tokens have been sent over Polygon PoS and Bitcoin bridges. PAXG seems to be his favorite token by far for token laundering.\n\nThese are all the tokens he's been swapping to:\n\nstETH, USDT, LINK, USDP, LDO, WBTC, SUSHI, YFI, 1INCH, UNI, LINK, MATIC, PAXG, SHIB, AAVE, APE, PAXG, SNX, renBTC\n\nI wouldn't trust anything posted by the media or random Twitter posts unless they're citing experts. This should be done by a professional trace analyzer because they have specialized tools for tracing this.\n\n**I do not believe the hacker is related to the Bahamian government. These transactions are much too random, chaotic, and swap for too many random tokens.** If it is the Bahamian government, then they're totally letting SBF create chaos with it.\n\nAFAICT, the hacker is not trying to sell ETH for BTC. I'm guessing he's trying to exit using whatever exchange or swap that hasn't yet blacklisted him. PAXG was the weak link on Nov 12. It's now $60M worth of ETH to WBTC and renBTC, which he's using to exit to BTC mainnet.\n\n----------------\n\n####**The FTX Hacker Accounts**\n\n**There are at least 11 FTX hacker addresses**, most of which were created on the Nov 12. One last one was created today.\n\n**Main address**: https://etherscan.io/address/0x59abf3837fa962d6853b4cc0a19513aa031fd32b\n\n- **History**\n  - This one's been around for 8 days since Nov 12\n  - It's been growing ETH. Started with 160k ETH. Grew to 200k ETH  on Nov 15 and then to 250k ETH on Nov 19. 50k ETH has been swapped or transferred out today.\n  - On the first day, it was sent out to 26 different addresses.\n  - Apparently, he found out that PAXG swaps were the weakest link and was able to swap to $60M of it.\n  - Since then, it has stayed quiet (other than for shitcoin transfers) until today. There was 1 lone Tx on Nov 15 for token approval for [DAI on CoW Protocol](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b863b03815cc6ea7b1406d6d8dbea37b15c8eb8471d7c1c46f2126e38ab0f52)\n  - Suddenly today, it has become active again\n- **Current balance**\n  - 200k ETH, down from 250k ETH yesterday. that's a difference of about $60M USD worth of ETH that went elsewhere.\n  - $14M of PAXG\n  - 70+ random shit tokens. Some were sent by others to insult the owner. Some were swapped into by the owner.\n- **Nov 12 activity**\n  - This guy is an absolute DeFi degenerate. He's possibly testing for blacklists on his first day or trying to exit as fast as he can. He used over a dozen different swaps.\n  - Did tons of token approval. I stopped listing the duplicates on different dApps. For example, he tested approvals for PAXG on at least a dozen swaps.

Dozens of tokens and DeFi swap have been used. Some tokens have been sent over Polygon PoS and Bitcoin bridges. PAXG seems to be his favorite token by far for token laundering.</p>\n\n<p>These are all the tokens he&#39;s been swapping to:</p>\n\n<p>stETH, USDT, LINK, USDP, LDO, WBTC, SUSHI, YFI, 1INCH, UNI, LINK, MATIC, PAXG, SHIB, AAVE, APE, PAXG, SNX, renBTC</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t trust anything posted by the media or random Twitter posts unless they&#39;re citing experts. This should be done by a professional trace analyzer because they have specialized tools for tracing this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I do not believe the hacker is related to the Bahamian government. These transactions are much too random, chaotic, and swap for too many random tokens.</strong> If it is the Bahamian government, then they&#39;re totally letting SBF create chaos with it.</p>\n\n<p>AFAICT, the hacker is not trying to sell ETH for BTC. I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s trying to exit using whatever exchange or swap that hasn&#39;t yet blacklisted him. PAXG was the weak link on Nov 12. It&#39;s now $60M worth of ETH to WBTC and renBTC, which he&#39;s using to exit to BTC mainnet.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h4><strong>The FTX Hacker Accounts</strong></h4>\n\n<p><strong>There are at least 11 FTX hacker addresses</strong>, most of which were created on the Nov 12.

With that said, let me just start by saying, **self custody is always the safest option, no doubt.** Now here's where I contradict everything I just said and you guys start throwing rotten fruit at me. I think what I really mean to say is *self custody is always the most trustless option, no doubt.* Just because you only have to trust yourself, or a few people in a multisig situation. Now I know I lack a few important key chemicals in my brain, but I think some people either don't have the ability to do it, or don't trust themselves to do it correctly.\n\nFor *them* a qualified custodian may actually be the *safer* option. As far as custodians go, CB is one of the safest options available right now, and I might even be able to argue that if you're not a techy, they're a better custodian than you are. Kraken may be the same, I don't use them regularly so I haven't dug into them, but they've been battling the storm and burying their enemies just as long as CB. Gemini is the same, but this FTX thing has poured some poop on my opinion of them lately.

So as usual, CB/Kraken looking like m'fin' stone pillars rn! \ud83d\ude18\n\nSo what I'm tryna say is, I'm tired of the \"exchanges are bad\" rhetoric. Some are bad. Some are exchanges AND custodians. Some have proven themselves trustworthy and resilient through multiple crypto crashes that have crushed dozens of lesser competitors. Some spend their money to push for reasonable legal guidance so the ecosystem as a whole can grow, which ultimately makes YOU more money. Some actually put their individual lives and reputations on the line to fight for things like Tornado cash,^(FREEEDOOOMMM!) despite the potential consequences to their own well-being and livelihood. The good ones have a few things in common:\n\n1. They have regular, public, independent audits of 1:1.\n2. Quarterly public financial statements.\n3. Proof of Insurance.\n4. Not offering shit that seems waaayyy to good to be true.\n5. Not run by children.\n6. Not running flashy promo's and throwing elaborate parties.\n7. Not incorporated in the Bahamas, a country notorious for money laundering.\n\nChrist people, you can trust people to secure your crypto, but you gotta watch what they do for a while before you trust them! They gotta be transparent with you! There has to be a damn paper trail! Just because some asshole says some shit you like to hear doesn't mean you should fucking trust them and just because one asshole fucked you over doesn't mean every other asshole on his block is going to fuck you over too! Who raised you people!? TRUST IS EARNED, NOT GIVEN! TRUST SHOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO EARN! OTHERWISE IT'S WORTHLESS AND YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYBODY! FFS!\n\n*Deep breaths John, it's gonna be ok buddy, you're not alone, all of you agree with you.*\n\nIn conclusion, to my non-cryptonerds, do what's best for *you* and *your* risk profile, but please do take the time to figure out self custody. It's not that hard, take your time to learn, it's worth the trouble! Hey ... you don't have to trust yourself with all your assets, just eaaassee it in there at first.
