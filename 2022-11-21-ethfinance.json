I believe they were the [first mass slashing on mainnet](https://twitter.com/ankr/status/1334988119163203588?lang=en). They hold your Ether and can walk away with it when withdrawals are enabled. (i.e. they're fully custodial)\n\n**Lido** - [29 operators who control 30% of the beacon chain](https://www.rated.network/?network=mainnet&view=entity). They currently represent the  [biggest systemic risk to the beacon chain](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).\n\n**Coinbase** - Coinbase is a fully custodial provider, this means they hold ALL of your assets and you hold nothing of value. When you stake with coinbase, **you** don't stake anything or have any on-chain guarantees that you'll ever receive your Ether back. As a centralized custodial entity they have control over [nearly 12% of the network](https://www.rated.network/?network=mainnet&view=entity) as ONE entity.. with total control of the coin votes.\n\n**Stakewise** - Their current design is similar to Lido, but they are a much smaller operator being a small operator means that they don't concentrate a lot of network votes. This chart references their v2 product, but their v3 product is likely to be far more decentralizing when it's released.\n\n**Rocket Pool** - This is the only fractional staking option that meets my high standard. You can see that [the Ethereum.org staking pages holds them in the highest regard as well](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/pools/). Rocket Pool consists of 1700 non-permissioned nodes (meaning anyone can do it) who put up 16 Ether of their own collateral in exchange for the privilege of staking Ether provided to the smart contract. Rocket Pool is fully smart contract based and the operators never have an opportunity to steal your Ether - what goes into the smart contract comes out of the smart contract. The growing pains associated with Rocket Pool are that they haven't grown fast enough, because they require something \"at stake\" (remember, that's what staking is!) so node operators need to have collateral before the network can grow. Contrast this with an operator who has nothing at stake - they simply take user deposits and stake other people's money with zero risk of their own.\n\nI really love [this video](https://twitter.com/CryptoBrad89/status/1593094515816296450) created a few days ago, it says many of the things I think about the risks of custodial providers.\n\ntl;dr: When you focus on \"APR\" as your metric of good staking options you're at high risk of losing your funds through malfeasance or social slashing; or you're simply doing damage to the network that will reduce your long term returns.\n\n\\* Edited to remove excessive modifiers.

No. Computer science terms. Let's break them down.\n\n---\n\n**Virtual Machine (VM):** \"Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.\" Ethereum is a process virtual machine because it executes computer programs in a platform-independent environment. The programs it executes are smart contracts, and it operates on a platform of multiple standardized client implementations across a heterogeneous pool of operating systems and hardware.\n\n**Shared:** The Ethereum virtual machine can be read from and written to by clients with differing network perspectives.\n\n**Software Assurance:** \"the level of confidence that software is free from vulnerabilities, either intentionally designed into the software or accidentally inserted at any time during its lifecycle, and that the software functions in the intended manner.\" The Ethereum virtual machine has executed every VM instruction as written since its launch in 2015, making it a high-assurance VM. Although show-stopping bugs have been found in software that people have published to Ethereum, none have caused the Ethereum virtual machine itself to be interrupted or produce incorrect output.\n\n**Autonomous:** \"denoting or performed by a device capable of operating without direct human control.\" Ethereum smart contracts are autonomous because they are write-once-use-forever, never requiring any human maintenance except to add additional functionality.\n\n**Permissionless:** \"Not requiring authorization. Permissionless often refers to public blockchains that allow anyone to participate in validating and mining transactions as well as using the system to buy, sell and trade assets.\" In addition to enabling the buying, selling, and trading of assets, Ethereum also allows people to permissionlessly publish software to run on its VM. This is in contrast with a permissioned system such as a bank server handling a bank ledger, to which only a very small group of authorized parties are allowed to publish software.\n\n**Composability:** \"Composability is a system design principle that deals with the inter-relationships of components. A highly composable system provides components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.\" The Ethereum network allows smart contracts to make external function calls to other smart contracts. These function calls follow standardized software interfaces, allowing for larger software systems to be built out of modular components. This is why sometimes people call Ethereum \"money legos\".\n\n**Extensibility:** \"Extensibility is a measure of the ability to extend a system and the level of effort required to implement the extension. Extensions can be through the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality. The principle provides for enhancements without impairing existing system functions.\" Ethereum is extensible because it provides an explicit virtual environment for developers to extend it. In other words Ethereum is \"a piece of software that runs software\", the gold standard for extensibility.\n\n**Timestamped:** \"A timestamp is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred.\" Ethereum provides reliable timestamps because it's composed of a chain of hashed data that includes information about when events occurred, as well as mechanisms to prevent that chain from being changed or overwritten.\n\n**Audit:** \"an official inspection of an individual's or organization's accounts, typically by an independent body.\" Ethereum is auditable because every account as well as its balance and code contents is viewable by the general public, who have the ability to reconcile the history of the VM's state.\n\n**Atomic:** \"In computer programming, atomic describes a unitary action or object that is essentially indivisible, unchangeable, whole, and irreducible.\" Ethereum is atomic because every attempt to write data to the chain either succeeds or fails in entirety. Its design prevents an attempted action from being partially applied to the VM's state.\n\n**Computation Over Data:** Ethereum's virtual machine is composed of data, or *state*, coupled with rules for mutating that state based on the results of computation.\n\n---\n\nWhile it's true that the blockchain industry *is* full of meaningless buzzwords, I find that people often throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Hopefully this post elucidates some of those phrases that people often use to describe properties of the Ethereum protocol.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-21 14:23:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ixa4yit","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z0r4kc","parent_id":"t3_z0r4kc","score":50,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-21 14:54:09","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-11-25 18:23:44","id":"ixa95k4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z0r4kc","parent_id":"t1_ixa4yit","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/REALJohnBMacLemore","body":"Or \u201cI don\u2019t want to admit that I don\u2019t actually know shit about fuck\u201d","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Or \u201cI don\u2019t want to admit that I don\u2019t actually know shit about fuck\u201d</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-21 16:32:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ixalxs6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z0r4kc","parent_id":"t1_ixa95k4","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/8inchrye","body":"Incredible comment!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Incredible comment!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-21 18:43:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ixb353m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z0r4kc","parent_id":"t1_ixa4yit","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Smegma_Farmer","body":"Repost this tomorrow if you don't get the requisite amount of up diddlies","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Repost this tomorrow if you don&#39;t get the requisite amount of up diddlies</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-21 20:44:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ixbhavx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z0r4kc","parent_id":"t1_ixa4yit","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"> requisite amount of up diddlies\n\nDiddlies would be nice, but I'm gunning for a doot.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>requisite amount of up diddlies</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Diddlies would be nice, but I&#39;m gunning for a doot.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-21 20:52:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ixbi2f0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z0r4kc","parent_id":"t1_ixbhavx","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/USERNAME_ERROR","body":"The prevailing sentiment is a delight for crypto haters, none more so than folks on Hacker News.

Since then I've been doing some research, and it seems like there are tons of different protocols coming out with vaults with various ways to earn yield on your GLP.\n\nFor those who don't know what GLP is, it is essentially a basket of many tokens that trade on the GMX platform, but I really think of it in three ways:\n\n1. Firstly, although the actual breakdown is more complicated, it can be thought of as 1/2 ETH and 1/2 USDC.\n\n2. Secondly, it accrues trading fees, yield farming rewards, and impermanent loss, so it can be thought of as an AMM ETH-USDC LP position.\n\n3. Finally, because the protocol tries to maintain specific collateral ratios, impermanent loss is immediately realized. As such, it can be thought of as a bet against GMX traders.\n\nThe last point is the crux of the matter, because it may break down in certain situations. For example, since USDT is part of the collateral mix, if Tether ever went bust there would be enormous losses. When I heard that the FTX hacker started to dump his ETH, I immediately pulled out of GLP - it [can be seen](https://stats.gmx.io/) that traders made enormous profits shorting ETH. That being said, I also pulled out when the long trade became crowded before the merge and lost out because of that.\n\nAnyways, aside from the hopefully temporary current circumstances, GMX has really been killing it and is widely regarded as the winner of the 2022 bear market. Assuming this continues, I wonder if anyone else has been looking at the different opportunities for GLP. In the same way that Logris analyzed the Curve Wars and provided a nifty chart to determine how one ought to position oneself depending on their position size and emission preferences, I wonder if anyone has analyzed the different offerings for GLP?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there is Vesta, which from what I gathered is basically a Maker clone on Arbitrum. It makes sense to use GLP as collateral there since it essentially already half stables. At the moment, the vault is full. It seems many are using this to perform leveraged yield farming on GLP, so to maintain the peg the vault will probably not be increased until VST liquidity improves, especially as they are decreasing the GLP stability pool rewards, the other obvious thing to do with the VST loan.\n\nThere is a protocol called Rage Trade which is [launching a vault for GLP](https://medium.com/@ragetrade/sneak-peak-rage-gmx-recycled-liquiditywhat-is-rages-80-20-recycled-gmx-vault-68bdaec041f0). My understanding of this is that it is essentially leveraging the bet against GMX traders.\n\nThen are two different similar options from the Dopex ecosystem, one from [Dopex](https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-essentials-gmx-and-perpetual-contracts), and another from [JonesDAO](https://twitter.com/FroyoFren/status/1594695365659594752). Both appear to be vaults which earn yield from GLP as if they were stablecoin farms, but I'm unclear on the details. As an aside, it's confusing to me why protocols on different levels of the Dopex stack appear to be competing with each other. Is this related to the controversy when one of the projects dumped the other's tokens?\n\nThe last one I found is from PlutusDAO, which is another Dopex-adjacent project. But in this case, it is simply merely an autocompounder charging exorbitant fees. For a project on L2, I can't recommend it unless one is highly bullish on the PLS token for some reason, as one is essentially trading ETH rewards for PLS emissions. \n\nAnything I missed?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I saw a comment recently about how Vesta needs to increase the cap for their GLP vaults, which surprised me, because as far as I knew the only thing you could do with your GLP was hold it.

My understanding of this is that it is essentially leveraging the bet against GMX traders.</p>\n\n<p>Then are two different similar options from the Dopex ecosystem, one from <a href=\"https://blog.dopex.io/articles/dopex-papers/dopex-essentials-gmx-and-perpetual-contracts\">Dopex</a>, and another from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FroyoFren/status/1594695365659594752\">JonesDAO</a>. Both appear to be vaults which earn yield from GLP as if they were stablecoin farms, but I&#39;m unclear on the details. As an aside, it&#39;s confusing to me why protocols on different levels of the Dopex stack appear to be competing with each other. Is this related to the controversy when one of the projects dumped the other&#39;s tokens?</p>\n\n<p>The last one I found is from PlutusDAO, which is another Dopex-adjacent project. But in this case, it is simply merely an autocompounder charging exorbitant fees. For a project on L2, I can&#39;t recommend it unless one is highly bullish on the PLS token for some reason, as one is essentially trading ETH rewards for PLS emissions. </p>\n\n<p>Anything I missed?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-21 10:13:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ix93h1l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z0r4kc","parent_id":"t3_z0r4kc","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Maswasnos","body":"Great primer on GLP and related opportunities.
