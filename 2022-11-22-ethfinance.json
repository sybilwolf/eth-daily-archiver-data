I feel good paying as I am 100-1000x more wealthy than them and feel good supporting them. There is obviously no exact line but a billionaire is more than 1000x wealthier than regular people in the west. I think that is too much and it is only natural for that wealth to slowly diminish as opposed to increase like it actually does. Would you be fine if the billionaires owned 90% of all assets, what about 100% and we normal people only rent from them? I think we are slowly moving toward that future as capital grows capital and they have more and more power. \n\n> What about if those people you've decided it's ok to steal from had a charitable plan\n\nA charitable billionaire is an oxymoron. All large companies do everything they can to minimize taxes. That's natural. You expect them to use every loophole that benefits them. It doesn't make it right. Nor for them to lobby our politicians to keep them open. This happens everywhere. The end result is more or less the same if they would pay fair share from the start. \n\n> You can bend yourself into a pretzel trying to answer these questions, but we both know what the real answer is. You want what you want, so you'll take what you want and you'll find a way to justify it.\n\nArguing like that is a sign of weak arguments. I don't think you realize how wealthy billionaires are and the lifestyle they live.

I feel good paying as I am 100-1000x more wealthy than them and feel good supporting them. There is obviously no exact line but a billionaire is more than 1000x wealthier than regular people in the west. I think that is too much and it is only natural for that wealth to slowly diminish as opposed to increase like it actually does. Would you be fine if the billionaires owned 90% of all assets, what about 100% and we normal people only rent from them?

All large companies do everything they can to minimize taxes. That&#39;s natural. You expect them to use every loophole that benefits them. It doesn&#39;t make it right. Nor for them to lobby our politicians to keep them open. This happens everywhere. The end result is more or less the same if they would pay fair share from the start. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can bend yourself into a pretzel trying to answer these questions, but we both know what the real answer is.
