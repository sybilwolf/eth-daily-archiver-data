It's difficult to read tbh. I went through a horrible breakup just before covid. My ex handled it dreadfully (basically a rug pull) so for me it was an emotional and logistical clusterfuck. Some properly dark times. I think she would have been happy to maintain a different kind of relationship. Possibly even still would. But I hate her guts to this day. I miss her a lot too, at times, but I fucking hate her for how she played things. I don't think I can get past it. OTOH, it was made considerably worse by covid and geopolitics at the time.\n\nFWIW, in my experience, women (and probably gay folk??) are fortunate enough to be able to move in and out of relationships more regularly, if they chose. No shortage of offers. (My ex certanily had no trouble getting into bed with someone else in short order!) Whereas, I have spent the past year trying to date and it's a nightmare. Ergo, if I felt like I had options to move on, I might not feel quite so much loathing toward my ex. Either way, if you're anything like me, it will take a very long time for you to adjust and figure out what is going to work for you.

I think she would have been happy to maintain a different kind of relationship. Possibly even still would. But I hate her guts to this day. I miss her a lot too, at times, but I fucking hate her for how she played things. I don&#39;t think I can get past it.

They have ~$1.2bn dollar hole there. Genesis was making riskier loans, but also to shady guys- and they got hurt by it. DCG assumed this liability from Genesis- basically saying, \u201cyes we made a mistake, our risk / reward lending wasn\u2019t tight enough, we\u2019re going to do better, but Genesis is ok.\u201d Honestly, they probably should have raised outside money for Genesis right then and there, BUT it wasn\u2019t a great environment and so DCG said, we\u2019ll plug this hole with money in 2032. Until then, we\u2019ll put the hole on our (DCG\u2019s) balance sheet. \n\nFast forward to the FTX collapse. Genesis lending desk is actually making much better loans. They\u2019re taking more collateral, better collateral, etc. etc. however, their trading desk, a separate division, had $175mm on FTX that vanished over night. No one expected this honestly- it was a black swan. If the trading desk wanted to continue as normal, it needed to make its traders hole. So DCG inserted $140mm in cash to Genesis\u2019s trading desk- and that business is now up and running fine. \n\nBut what wasn\u2019t predicted was a run on the bank. Genesis lending had made better loans, but there\u2019s still a duration mismatch. Given the lack of trust in the space with FTX, BlockFi and everyone else blowing up- people wanted their money back. Genesis couldn\u2019t process the withdrawals fast enough because of the mismatch in term loans made and open term (aka callable) loans taken on from accredited investors. Unfortunately the liquidity DCG had was used to plug the hole at Genesis trading and not enough to process withdrawals in time. Hence withdrawals paused. DCG has to wait until it can build up more cash from its other business lines. \n\nNow, DCG should have raised money back in June/July and diluted it\u2019s ownership in Genesis if it needed to. It didn\u2019t. Now it\u2019s looking like it\u2019ll have to dilute ownership in DCG instead. Alternatively, they can come with some interesting structures to preserve ownership while raising money (raising debt, selling future revenue stream for a period of time, etc.)   \n\nLenders to Genesis (including Gemini) are going to organize and negotiate a way to make everyone okay. No one is going to lose 100% of money because the loans Genesis made are actually good. They are backed by real collateral. I do believe it\u2019s just a duration / liquidity mismatch. The $1bn hole is a longer term problem- which I\u2019m not sure needs to get solved now, but if it does lenders can be made whole much faster than waiting for all the loans to mature. \n\nMy prediction: Genesis is going to be fine. Will there be some short term pain of not having access to funds, or possibly taking a loss on interest or even a slight haircut? Yes. But there are real assets at DCG and the loans Genesis made are of decent quality - not to a black hole like SBF did with client money. Declaring bankruptcy for Genesis would be a death knell on DCG as a company and Barry\u2019s personal reputation. He would never be able to access the credit markets again. \n\nA lot of this is speculation, but tbh, it\u2019s probably closer to the truth than what I see here.
