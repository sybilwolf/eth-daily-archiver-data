It caught my attention because that gas usage was 10x more efficient than anything I've seen. Updating balances requires SSTORE, which uses 15-20k gas unless you're zeroing a balance.\n\nIt turns they're not actually updating the balance. They were **faking it** by using an [**Emit**](https://solidity-by-example.org/events/), which is minly used to log events to the blockchain. You can legitimately use Emits to permanently update contract functionality (e.g. the [Adventureum concept game](https://anallergytoanalogy.github.io/blockchain-adventure/)), but it's not used for ERC-20 tokens.\n\nSomeone in Ethdev figured it out pretty quickly, so this scam might be quite common. I'm still relatively new.\n\n**The blockchain explorer is being tricked in 2 different ways**:\n\n* **Fake transfer**: It sees the Emit/Event and assumes that 50K tokens were transferred each time. So you can make the blockchain explorer think you're sending X amount when you're actually sending Y amount. In the spammer's case, 0 tokens were actually sent.\n* **Fake balance**: When you view an account, it uses balanceOf(address) to determine the token balance on that account. In the spammer's case, balanceOf(address) is hard-coded to return 50K for ALL accounts instead of properly using the address-to-balance mapping.\n\n**Testing this**:\n\nI gave this a test by creating a similar contract on the Sepolia testnet. Sure enough, when I use the AirDrop function to send out 50 tokens to each account, the explorer is tricked into [thinking they were sent](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xee6b95f750fa52d53cc5c57910dfa69545c8e77b38c42de52b0cec9a99a7f45d). When I check the balance of one of those [accounts](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x59abf3837fa962d6853b4cc0a19513aa031fd32b) in the Token drop-down menu, it shows a different number (69.42) because my balanceOf() function is hard-coded to return that amount.\n\nBut if any of those accounts tries to do a real transfer, they'll get this error message: \"execution reverted: ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance\", revealing that they actually own zero tokens despite, contradicting the Explorer. The whole ERC-20 contract is broken and doesn't work properly.\n\n**Even Metamask** was tricked when I checked my accounts for balance. The sending account showed the token transfer while the receiving one didn't. I'm not sure whether you can do this for internal ETH transactions as well. I'll probably test that another time. If so, that would be pretty nasty since a lot of people would fall for it. (I certainly fell for this contract but thought it was very suspicious.)\n\nAs for the spammer, I'm not sure what his endgame is. I suspect it's preparing for some kind of scam, possibly tricking others into think they got Airdrops. Or maybe it's for advertising to their sketchy website.\n\n-----\n\n**Edit**: According to /u/kazuuuuuuuuuuuu on ethdev:\n\n> This is a known scam.
