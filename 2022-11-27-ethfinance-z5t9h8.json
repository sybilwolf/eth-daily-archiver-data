Because staking rewards are variable and represent issuance and MEV capture, a more accurate term than APR would be Expected Returns (ER), or in other words [Expected Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of returns. I would argue that this is the only reasonable way to interpret APR in the context of staking returns.\n\nIf we take APR in this way to mean Expected Returns (ER), then pools have the exact same ER before fees as solo staking, no matter what the time frame is. Pools achieve this ER while maintaining a lower statistical [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance).\n\n> they win high fee blocks more often/predictably\n\nThis is true, but does not affect ER. This is because when one of those high fee blocks is discovered, it's split across many participants, whereas when a solo staker discovers a high fee block, the entirety of it is paid to a staker. This is what results in pools having identical ER with lower variance. I suspect you may be on the same page with me about this, but the terminology is important imo.\n\n> Sure if you wait for infinity we all converge to the same APR but fortunately our investment timeline is not that long.\n\nThe ER is the same regardless of time frame. The variance is what converges.\n\nI believe it's important to make this distinction, or else people might get the wrong impression that they will earn more on average over time from pools than from solo staking.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the video, though.
