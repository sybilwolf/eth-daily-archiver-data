There is a very real chance that the wealth we will have acquired in a few dozen years from this whole internet of money thing will be life changing not just for you but for whomever you bequeath your assets to. With that in mind, I'd like to talk about crypto post-mortem. How are you managing potentially inter-generational wealth? Specifically, do you have an answer to a very important question: \"Can they get the money?\"\n\nThis is a separate question from \"is the money secure?\". I wrote recently about how to safeguard your assets in a self-sovereign way. If you haven't read that yet, I recommend starting with [this post](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-weakest-link) instead. Otherwise, cast your eye into the future with me. Spoiler alert: you are going to die; *presumably*. How prepared are your beneficiaries without you there to guide them? Are the instructions in your will sufficient? Do you have a Will executor on retainer with whom you have reviewed your instructions? Do you have someone who will be able to make sense of your transaction history and find the money? Will they know how to spin down a validator to withdraw your ETH, bridge funds from every alt-L1 you aped into last year, deleverage whatever degen position you have in Gearbox, GMX, or Dydx, redeem your [ePyvCurveLUSD-27DEC21](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/rate-speculation-platforms/) so they can sell it, or pay back the loan you took on your favorite animal or part of speech NFT? For most people the answer is no. If even half of that made sense to you, you're a web3 veteran. Don't expect that expertise from your descendants.\n\nBy now I have had the opportunity to meet a good number of spouses and children of people in this space. When my wife and I ask them if they understand how to get the money, I've yet to receive a confident yes. Without exception every response has been either a nervous no or at best that they know someone in the community they could ask. This is a troubling pattern. These are the answers we get from people deep enough in this space they would bring their wives or children to a blockchain event where we could meet them and ask. The average situation must be worse.\n\nWhat can you do **now** to help safeguard inter-generational wealth while you're still in a position to act?\n\n**Minimum Viable Expertise**\n\n1. Have a system to track your assets. Honestly, this also helps you as an investor. If a catastrophic event happens and you win a Darwin award tomorrow, where is the money? Before I started tracking assets I remember using Zapper for the first time and finding a Uniswap LP I'd forgotten about. It was like finding a few hundred dollars in the couch. But, Zapper/Zerion might not track everything or they might not be there forever. Some people used Blockfolio until FTX imploded recently and took it down. I audit my bad decisions on a monthly basis as a form of personal reckoning. Most of this is just a transcription of Zapper that takes 20 minutes. A few positions require me to check some website or other and get a number Zapper is missing. You don't have to do this for everything but I at least track the location of my ETH and stablecoins which is the bulk of it. It also gives me warm-fuzzies to watch the interest roll in and helps with tax planning.\n\n2. Store the system in an accessible location. This doesn't just mean share a file with someone; they will need to understand the software being used. You should account for the lowest common denominator of your inheritors. I personally have a Google sheet that is shared with my wife. A share url for this file is included alongside my private keys.\n\n3. Review the result at least once. My wife calls this the 'teach a man to fish' scenario. It's also the only part of this that requires active participation by someone who might be receiving life-changing wealth from you. It seems like a fair ask but if they absolutely cannot be bothered or are illiterate then a video walkthrough can be stored alongside the file or you can meet with your Will executor instead.\n\n4. Have a lifeline. Get a community member to agree to be a touch point for questions. Exactly one out of 85000 subscribers on /r/ethfinance has asked me to fill this role. In the event there is no one willing to help you I advise being less of a grouch. Underneath a thick layer of scammers there is a core of good people in crypto. Engage with the community and be a good enough person to that community that people there are willing to help you. If that sounds intimidating maybe attend the next [Hodlercon](https://hodlercon.com/). Just saying, we were an amazing group of people who are likely to be in web3 for the rest of our lives.\n\nA few other things depend on how you are transferring control of assets. I describe a system for securing/reassembling a private key in my [Weakest Link](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-weakest-link/) post so I won't rehash it here. However, there are valid reasons why you might not want to take this route.\n\n* While your family is grieving your loss you might find it cruel to send them on a pilgrimage to collect engraved steel plates like they're assembling Dragonballs. This isn't some fun geocache exercise where they get to look at pretty waterfalls, collect POAPs, and receive heartfelt love messages like P.S. I Love You. Every step of reassembling key fragments is nerve wracking. Even having successfully recovered the fragments the process can be error prone, e.g. \"what is a derivation path?\", and having them all in one place for decryption is outright dangerous.\n\n* Giving someone your private key is basically giving someone access to both your assets and your\u00a0identity. You may prefer to be dead without someone playing Weekend at Bernie's with your online identity.\n\nThat said, I offer two alternatives to handing off assets that don't involve reassembling a private key.\n\n**Social Recovery**\n\nThis always involves some form of multi-sig. Unlike a Gnosis safe, an argent wallet has a single privileged controller address which can execute transactions on its own. However, there is a set of recovery addresses that can work together to change the controller address. While simple, this approach is not without its downsides:\n\n* If the recovery addresses are accessible to people you are adding a layer of trust.\n\n* This will prevent you from interacting with certain Defi protocols like Alchemix that prohibit contract interaction.\n\n* The multi-sig address, not the controller address, is still effectively your identity and this hasn't addressed that concern.\n\n**Dead Man's Switch**\n\nThere are two protocols I'm aware of building a dead man's switch solution: [Will3](https://www.will3.xyz/) and [Sarcophagus](https://sarcophagus.io/). Instead of passing control of the address you grant ERC-20 approval to a contract that a keeper maintains. You then occasionally execute a \"proof of life\" transaction. This could work in different ways but the simplest is just whether any transaction has occurred on your address in the allotted proof of life window. A more likely solution is that the proof of life transaction is specific to their system and also pays them. The dead man's switch kicks in after some time of inactivity and when it does the approved assets are migrated from your account and distributed according to a policy you specify.\n\nNow this may sound insane at first but the token approval can be granted to an audited smart contract with all the rules required to do this safely. At minimum you can verify that the keeper can't just rug you while you're alive, actively using the address, and paying them.\n\nThe main advantage here is this solution is the simplest for your loved ones. Behind this system is a company. That company can reach out to your loved ones after the assets are recovered and provide all the knowledge and assistance they need (for a price) even if they have never used an Ethereum wallet before in their life. Of course, it's not a perfect solution either:\n\n* There is maintenance work and gas in keeping all your approvals up to date.\n\n* You are adding a layer of trust that the keeper follows through when the proof of life window expires.\n\n* The keeper takes fees.\n\n* There are assets which can't be approved this way such as native ETH, validator withdraws, deposits to certain protocols like Alchemix that don't return an LP token, or things like veCRV which eventually require an unstake call before it can be moved.\n\n* You can rug yourself by not signing the proof of life transaction in time.\n\nI talk about a few potential improvements to these problems in the full post but I had to trim it to hit the character limit here.\n\n**What I Do**\n\nMost of the suggestions above are actually self-serving and just good hygiene in general. It's solid advice that probably should be your next step after you go self-sovereign with your assets. In our house my wife knows how to recover my private key and interpret my asset tracking sheet. Failing that, for example if we both die from the same event, our Will executor has notes and a few points of contact I trust from the community. All of the complexity for us lies in reassembling the private key. I consider that process as bulletproof as I can make it. The main takeaway I leave you with is to do a little advance work now while you can. It can make the difference of a lifetime for whomever you want to take care of.\n\n[Self-serving link](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/crypto-post-mortem/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;d like you to consider a question we only seem to entertain in the throws of a bull market: what if we&#39;re right? There is a very real chance that the wealth we will have acquired in a few dozen years from this whole internet of money thing will be life changing not just for you but for whomever you bequeath your assets to. With that in mind, I&#39;d like to talk about crypto post-mortem. How are you managing potentially inter-generational wealth? Specifically, do you have an answer to a very important question: &quot;Can they get the money?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This is a separate question from &quot;is the money secure?&quot;. I wrote recently about how to safeguard your assets in a self-sovereign way. If you haven&#39;t read that yet, I recommend starting with <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-weakest-link\">this post</a> instead. Otherwise, cast your eye into the future with me. Spoiler alert: you are going to die; <em>presumably</em>. How prepared are your beneficiaries without you there to guide them? Are the instructions in your will sufficient? Do you have a Will executor on retainer with whom you have reviewed your instructions? Do you have someone who will be able to make sense of your transaction history and find the money? Will they know how to spin down a validator to withdraw your ETH, bridge funds from every alt-L1 you aped into last year, deleverage whatever degen position you have in Gearbox, GMX, or Dydx, redeem your <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/rate-speculation-platforms/\">ePyvCurveLUSD-27DEC21</a> so they can sell it, or pay back the loan you took on your favorite animal or part of speech NFT? For most people the answer is no. If even half of that made sense to you, you&#39;re a web3 veteran. Don&#39;t expect that expertise from your descendants.</p>\n\n<p>By now I have had the opportunity to meet a good number of spouses and children of people in this space. When my wife and I ask them if they understand how to get the money, I&#39;ve yet to receive a confident yes. Without exception every response has been either a nervous no or at best that they know someone in the community they could ask. This is a troubling pattern. These are the answers we get from people deep enough in this space they would bring their wives or children to a blockchain event where we could meet them and ask. The average situation must be worse.</p>\n\n<p>What can you do <strong>now</strong> to help safeguard inter-generational wealth while you&#39;re still in a position to act?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Minimum Viable Expertise</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Have a system to track your assets. Honestly, this also helps you as an investor. If a catastrophic event happens and you win a Darwin award tomorrow, where is the money? Before I started tracking assets I remember using Zapper for the first time and finding a Uniswap LP I&#39;d forgotten about. It was like finding a few hundred dollars in the couch. But, Zapper/Zerion might not track everything or they might not be there forever. Some people used Blockfolio until FTX imploded recently and took it down. I audit my bad decisions on a monthly basis as a form of personal reckoning. Most of this is just a transcription of Zapper that takes 20 minutes. A few positions require me to check some website or other and get a number Zapper is missing. You don&#39;t have to do this for everything but I at least track the location of my ETH and stablecoins which is the bulk of it. It also gives me warm-fuzzies to watch the interest roll in and helps with tax planning.</p></li>\n<li><p>Store the system in an accessible location. This doesn&#39;t just mean share a file with someone; they will need to understand the software being used. You should account for the lowest common denominator of your inheritors. I personally have a Google sheet that is shared with my wife. A share url for this file is included alongside my private keys.</p></li>\n<li><p>Review the result at least once. My wife calls this the &#39;teach a man to fish&#39; scenario. It&#39;s also the only part of this that requires active participation by someone who might be receiving life-changing wealth from you. It seems like a fair ask but if they absolutely cannot be bothered or are illiterate then a video walkthrough can be stored alongside the file or you can meet with your Will executor instead.</p></li>\n<li><p>Have a lifeline. Get a community member to agree to be a touch point for questions. Exactly one out of 85000 subscribers on <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">/r/ethfinance</a> has asked me to fill this role. In the event there is no one willing to help you I advise being less of a grouch. Underneath a thick layer of scammers there is a core of good people in crypto.

You create an NFT. You transfer that NFT to your recipient. You create a smart contract with five functions: \n\n* defineRecipient: you define there the NFT you're using as an anchor, called the recipient's NFT, because the NFT's owner will be your recipient. Only you should be allowed to use that function. \n\n* grantAuthorization: you grant to your smart contract authorizations to spend any quantity of all your ERC-20 tokens (probably one by one, defining each time the token for which you grant authorization). I'm not an expert, so there may be better ways to do that. Obviously, again, you should be the only one allowed to use that function. \n\n* sendLifeSignal: you should be the only one allowed to use that function. It sends a life signal, unsetting the smart contract state about the block number of last requested life signal. \n\n* requestLifeSignal: anyone can use that function, but it will only do anything if the sender owns the recipient's NFT. It simply changes the smart contract state by setting a block number of last requested life signal. \n\n* requestFunds: anyone can use that function, but it will only do anything if the sender owns the recipient's NFT and a life signal has been requested without any life signal being sent during at least the X last blocks (define X in your smart contract, either hard coded or a parameter only the owner can change). It spends your tokens by giving them to the NFT's owner. \n\nThe prerequisite, though, is that your target must already have a wallet and must not lose such wallet. Ideally, a social recovery wallet should already be used by the target, to the point they know well enough how to use it. \n\nAlso, it doesn't work for ETH. If you want it to work for ETH, you need a bit more than that, like creating yet another function in the smart contract, that only works when a life signal has been requested for long enough without any life signal being sent. You'd create that transaction anytime you send a transaction to the mempool, so that it's always your last transaction and always sends all your ETH minus a big enough fee to make sure everything runs smoothly (not being sent to the mempool, just being sent to your recipient). When conditions are met, your recipient can then send that transaction. The ETH is then contained by the smart contract. Another function allows the recipient to retrieve any ETH the smart contract contains. \n\nOk, it was just some quick thoughts. There probably are way cleaner ways to do all that. \n\nA way more straightforward alternative is just encrypting your seed phrase with the public key of your recipient, writing it down on a paper and giving that paper to your notary with instructions to give it to your recipient upon your death. Normally, notaries are supposed to disclose such paper upon your death and never beforehand. But it requires to trust your notary, obviously. The advantage is that, here, it works for any kind of assymetric encryption your recipient would have a private access to. And it also grants full access to your seed phrase.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Life signals are way better than Deadman switches. You create an NFT. You transfer that NFT to your recipient.

Obviously, again, you should be the only one allowed to use that function. </p></li>\n<li><p>sendLifeSignal: you should be the only one allowed to use that function. It sends a life signal, unsetting the smart contract state about the block number of last requested life signal. </p></li>\n<li><p>requestLifeSignal: anyone can use that function, but it will only do anything if the sender owns the recipient&#39;s NFT. It simply changes the smart contract state by setting a block number of last requested life signal. </p></li>\n<li><p>requestFunds: anyone can use that function, but it will only do anything if the sender owns the recipient&#39;s NFT and a life signal has been requested without any life signal being sent during at least the X last blocks (define X in your smart contract, either hard coded or a parameter only the owner can change). It spends your tokens by giving them to the NFT&#39;s owner. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The prerequisite, though, is that your target must already have a wallet and must not lose such wallet. Ideally, a social recovery wallet should already be used by the target, to the point they know well enough how to use it. </p>\n\n<p>Also, it doesn&#39;t work for ETH. If you want it to work for ETH, you need a bit more than that, like creating yet another function in the smart contract, that only works when a life signal has been requested for long enough without any life signal being sent. You&#39;d create that transaction anytime you send a transaction to the mempool, so that it&#39;s always your last transaction and always sends all your ETH minus a big enough fee to make sure everything runs smoothly (not being sent to the mempool, just being sent to your recipient). When conditions are met, your recipient can then send that transaction. The ETH is then contained by the smart contract. Another function allows the recipient to retrieve any ETH the smart contract contains. </p>\n\n<p>Ok, it was just some quick thoughts. There probably are way cleaner ways to do all that. </p>\n\n<p>A way more straightforward alternative is just encrypting your seed phrase with the public key of your recipient, writing it down on a paper and giving that paper to your notary with instructions to give it to your recipient upon your death. Normally, notaries are supposed to disclose such paper upon your death and never beforehand. But it requires to trust your notary, obviously. The advantage is that, here, it works for any kind of assymetric encryption your recipient would have a private access to. And it also grants full access to your seed phrase.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-28 15:23:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iy5saq2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z6ohri","parent_id":"t1_iy2gh2n","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Sounds like it shares most of the same drawbacks as the dead man's switch but without the keeper trust.\n\nI'm not sure how the authorization would work but let me take a stab in the dark and summarize.

A few billionaires brings the mean way up.\n\nYour $500,000 debt figure was spread equally across all Americans, so it only makes sense to also spread the tax revenue equally across all Americans for the purpose of comparing it to the debt. This is because by proxy we're comparing total US debt to total US tax revenue, which is the important figure in the end.\n\nWhile it's true that the 1% is responsible for a large amount of taxes, it's tax revenue all the same, and it's available to the government to pay off their debts all the same.\n\n> Also, debt owned by US public institutions is just debt, right? It's not disappearing if you move it around.\n\nDebt comes with a corresponding credit. I'm saying that the US Government is actually the corresponding creditor to that debt, not that the debt was moved around. The government \"owes itself\" that money.\n\n> All this is incredibly complicated to decide what numbers are actually relevant.\n\nI agree completely. My argument here isn't to say that $500,000 of debt per person is reasonable. I'm saying that I don't think it's as obviously unreasonable as you suggest, and that I would ideally like to see someone with an economics background present an argument with better numbers than ours, since the premise goes against the \"default belief\" that the USA will not financially implode in 30 years.\n\n> Having said that, if I look at the public choice theory of this problem, I don't see a good way out.

That's how we got here, after all, and there seems to be no political will to fix it. So even if we could find a way to solve the math problem, the political problem may be intractable.\n\nVery true.

A few billionaires brings the mean way up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your $500,000 debt figure was spread equally across all Americans, so it only makes sense to also spread the tax revenue equally across all Americans for the purpose of comparing it to the debt. This is because by proxy we&#39;re comparing total US debt to total US tax revenue, which is the important figure in the end.</p>\n\n<p>While it&#39;s true that the 1% is responsible for a large amount of taxes, it&#39;s tax revenue all the same, and it&#39;s available to the government to pay off their debts all the same.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, debt owned by US public institutions is just debt, right? It&#39;s not disappearing if you move it around.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Debt comes with a corresponding credit. I&#39;m saying that the US Government is actually the corresponding creditor to that debt, not that the debt was moved around. The government &quot;owes itself&quot; that money.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>All this is incredibly complicated to decide what numbers are actually relevant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree completely. My argument here isn&#39;t to say that $500,000 of debt per person is reasonable. I&#39;m saying that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as obviously unreasonable as you suggest, and that I would ideally like to see someone with an economics background present an argument with better numbers than ours, since the premise goes against the &quot;default belief&quot; that the USA will not financially implode in 30 years.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having said that, if I look at the public choice theory of this problem, I don&#39;t see a good way out. Each particular group of legislators is disincentivized to fix it on their watch when they can just kick the can down the road a little. That&#39;s how we got here, after all, and there seems to be no political will to fix it. So even if we could find a way to solve the math problem, the political problem may be intractable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Very true. Though as long as the debt can be serviced, it will never come &quot;due&quot;.
