During the speach Powell's message was clear. Inflation is still too high, but the things they are doing (raising rates) are working. They will continue until the job is done. During the Q&A session, Powell has been much more optimistic than previous speeches. He said there is a clear path to a soft landing. He defined a soft landing as a scenario where unemployment does not spike and the economy doesn't enter a strong recession but inflation comes back to 2%. He also seems confident that the remaining sectors of high inflation are reversing trend and we will see them begin to drop in the near to mid term future.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Watching the speech and Q&amp;A session right now.

And if they go after the biggies, they will be picking fights with someone who can fight back, and the litigation will drag on for years and there's a decent chance they will lose (in fact, the more cases they file, the more certain it is they will lose at least some of them). \n\nSo they're left with their regulation by enforcement, deliberate ambiguity, occasionally picking off some minnows who can't fight back and jawboning the market strategy.

Of course, we can imagine doomsday scenarios like a ban on holding crypto with jail time etc, but honestly that's never going to happen - maybe until 2017 but it's mainstream enough now that an outright ban will be too difficult and there's enough vested interests in favour of crypto and not even the best way to go about it - it makes far more sense to coopt crypto and turn it into a copy of TradFi than to ban it (and that is my main concern - that the coming regulation will do that, by forcing intermediaries to exist for regulatory purposes etc). \n\nI suppose the only good thing about a world like that is that all of us will get rich as crypto goes mainstream even if it loses its soul and uniqueness to do so (as ETH holders - if you hold alts that are affected by new regs, you're going to be in trouble).

I know we had a discussion last week about what will happen if ETH is declared a security and we seemed to agree I think that although there would be a price crash in the short term, it wouldn't actually affect the utility and use cases of ETH in the medium term. \n\nThere's a good list of upcoming regulation potential here in this note by JP Morgan (screenshots in the tweet). I think they are way too dismissive of DeFi in their note, and way too focussed on CeFi and exchanges, but it's a good roundup. Some benign neglect of DeFi is absolutely fine with me - the problem is if there are unintended (or even intended) consequences of rules to kill self-custodial non-KYC no-intermediary financial system. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1597149734518820866?s=20&t=v75HcXeZh25XS1blkhA0Yg\n\nIt seems to me personally (not based directly on the JP Morgan piece - more general) that the key areas for reg are: \n\n1. Stablecoin regulation - this could actually be a good thing in many ways (proof of reserves etc) - my main concern is the potential crushing of non-fiat backed stables (LUSD etc) and non-pegged stables (RAI etc) or even algostables by an assumption that all stables MUST be fiat backed. \n\n2. CEX/CeFi regulation - again, proof of reserves, KYC etc (some of this already exists) - Again, mostly a good thing, no? \n\n3. Derivatives - See the CFTC case against Ooki/BZRX etc and so many dApps geofencing the USA. This is bad, but it's not an existential threat. \n\n4. Any kind of regulation that makes it difficult/impossible for crypto to function as intended - ie, which makes it impossible for core crypto values like self-custody, decentralization, permissionlessness, credible neutrality, no censorship  etc to operate on chain. This is kind of vague, but by far my biggest concern and I'd be interested in what we think is *realistically* gonna happen in this area. This includes stuff like impossible KYC rules for DeFi, travel rules for DeFi, banning self-hosted wallets, sanctions or other rules requiring on-chain censorship..stuff like that. \n\nOkay, I have some more thoughts (and may post in more detail on this in the coming days) but I'll stop rambling now - have already written a lot.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How bad can it really get for crypto with upcoming regulation?

I like money as much as the next guy, but I don&#39;t want to be in a space where I don&#39;t believe in the values. </p>\n\n<p>So, then how bad could it get? I know we had a discussion last week about what will happen if ETH is declared a security and we seemed to agree I think that although there would be a price crash in the short term, it wouldn&#39;t actually affect the utility and use cases of ETH in the medium term. </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a good list of upcoming regulation potential here in this note by JP Morgan (screenshots in the tweet). I think they are way too dismissive of DeFi in their note, and way too focussed on CeFi and exchanges, but it&#39;s a good roundup. Some benign neglect of DeFi is absolutely fine with me - the problem is if there are unintended (or even intended) consequences of rules to kill self-custodial non-KYC no-intermediary financial system. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1597149734518820866?s=20&amp;t=v75HcXeZh25XS1blkhA0Yg\">https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1597149734518820866?s=20&amp;t=v75HcXeZh25XS1blkhA0Yg</a></p>\n\n<p>It seems to me personally (not based directly on the JP Morgan piece - more general) that the key areas for reg are: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Stablecoin regulation - this could actually be a good thing in many ways (proof of reserves etc) - my main concern is the potential crushing of non-fiat backed stables (LUSD etc) and non-pegged stables (RAI etc) or even algostables by an assumption that all stables MUST be fiat backed. </p></li>\n<li><p>CEX/CeFi regulation - again, proof of reserves, KYC etc (some of this already exists) - Again, mostly a good thing, no? </p></li>\n<li><p>Derivatives - See the CFTC case against Ooki/BZRX etc and so many dApps geofencing the USA. This is bad, but it&#39;s not an existential threat. </p></li>\n<li><p>Any kind of regulation that makes it difficult/impossible for crypto to function as intended - ie, which makes it impossible for core crypto values like self-custody, decentralization, permissionlessness, credible neutrality, no censorship  etc to operate on chain. This is kind of vague, but by far my biggest concern and I&#39;d be interested in what we think is <em>realistically</em> gonna happen in this area. This includes stuff like impossible KYC rules for DeFi, travel rules for DeFi, banning self-hosted wallets, sanctions or other rules requiring on-chain censorship..stuff like that. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Okay, I have some more thoughts (and may post in more detail on this in the coming days) but I&#39;ll stop rambling now - have already written a lot.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-30 08:03:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iydex10","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z8j5c9","parent_id":"t3_z8j5c9","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/doomfuzzslayer","body":"Requiring KYC front end for using defi protocols - and onerous OFAC compliance that forces US validators to heavily censor.
