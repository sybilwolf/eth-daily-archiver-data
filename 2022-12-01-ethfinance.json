I started as a solo staker from a couple months after launch and now also joined on Rocket Pool. RP supports plugging into your own execution client, consensus client and MEV-boost (if you run it), so there is negligible overhead. I was positively surprised by how easy it is to set up a RP validator compared to a \"solo validator\". It's basically a normal GUI install wizard that does the boring set-up in the background itself (including monitoring programs if you want) and leaves the meaningful choices to you, like what clients you want to run and various options. Their documentation is also great. My next validator, whenever that day comes, will likely also be a RP one. The 15% extra yield (percentage, not percentage points) from commission and the MEV-smoothing pool are also attractive.\n\nThis is a great time to set up a RP node because of the rETH premium. I earned 0,38 ETH from the arbitrage, +0,3 ETH from my pre-existing rETH that I traded for ETH and I also earn 8,5% yield (currently) on my biggest alt holding in RPL, which before only sat in my wallet. There is no telling how long this premium will exist so don't wait, it has usually been a discount vs. fair value. \n\nFor setting up RP to use your clients, I used u/gethwethreth's [excellent guide](https://medium.com/@gethwethreth/guide-to-rocketpool-staking-on-ethereum-2-0-for-existing-solo-stakers-87aeb1dfbb76). I think it's written pre-merge so be aware it is not 100% updated, he says he is traveling so hasn't had the chance to update it. If you want a guide to follow blindly, I think you should wait, but if you are confident and take it slow, you will be fine, you are not risking anything yet. Some feedback was it says \"Websocket URL\" and then gives the HTTP, the pic is good though. At one or two places, I feel extra pics would be good and some new/old steps have changed since the guide was written. Step 22 you need to have the solution to \"if you have UFW rules\" closer. I was troubleshooting for 30 min until I read half a page down where the solution was. Most people will need it. The guide was written for Geth/Teku.
