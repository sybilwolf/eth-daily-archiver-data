The community puts out a release and resets their stopwatch but the many installed sites, and packages that incorporate it, each implement into their test/prod environments on their own highly varied and often highly delayed schedules.  Contrast to a blockchain HF where we don&#39;t reset the stopwatch until it&#39;s in Mainnet.  That&#39;s how a 14-week dev cadence turns into a 26 week HF cadence.</p>\n\n<p>Not that that would be a bad thing, either.  I suggest it might be good to establish up front a bi-annual HF cadence (say, every March/Sept).  Then everybody knows you gotta scale the work in the next release to make that date.  Just like what every agile sprint/scrum team in the world is doing now.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-02 15:46:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iyoq8k0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zadbqz","parent_id":"t1_iyogcqq","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"doot this boi","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>doot this boi</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-02 15:15:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iyomb5g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zadbqz","parent_id":"t1_iyogcqq","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Doot doot!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Doot doot!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-03 00:08:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iyq791d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zadbqz","parent_id":"t1_iyomb5g","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"Man, this is the kind of stuff I come to ethfinance for.

This is a very good time to start reading some guides on Eth staking as well as general server maintenance and security. These are suggestions based on what I felt gave me the best understanding of what I was doing. You won't get your node online in record time, but this approach gave me a lot more confidence that I could handle unexpected issues than if I'd just blindly done a setup guide speedrun. \n\nThere is a lot to take in! Seriously, don't try to do it all at once. Expect the whole thing to take a few weeks unless you can work on this full-time. It's not a race, IMO feeling secure that you can handle issues is well worth taking a week or two longer to setup.\n\nReally good guides for the staking bit are the ones by SomerEsat [https://someresat.medium.com/](https://someresat.medium.com/) and CoinCashew [https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet) . From what I've read, the SomerEsat approach may be somewhat more secure, but I found it helpful to cross-reference different steps from 2 guides.\n\nBefore you even get to the staking aspect, you'll need to make a bunch of decisions on how you configure your staking machine. It's very similar to setting up a server. DigitalOcean has a lot of great material for this. e.g. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-22-04\n\n* Do you want to encrypt your SSD? Doing so will make your box more secure against physical intrusion (if it's powered off), but would require manual intervention on every restart. Dig into the pros and cons (e.g. on r/ethstaker) of this to help make your decision.\n* Do you want to be able to remotely access your staking machine? Most people will, unless they're staking on a box which is always connected to a monitor anyway. Remote access is a lot more convenient. If you do, you'll want to read up on SSH and how to use it securely e.g. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-22-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-22-04) [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server) \n* Is it sufficient for your remote access only to work when on your home network (assuming that's what your staking machine is connected to)? If not, and you'd like to be able to SSH in from anywhere, consider setting up something like [https://tailscale.com/](https://tailscale.com/) to help with security.\n* Would you like to enable 2FA when logging into your staking machine? If so, this is one approach [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-ssh-on-ubuntu-20-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-ssh-on-ubuntu-20-04)\n* You'll need to mess with firewalls during the setup - this may be useful https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands\n\nIf you have a spare (old?) PC at home you could install Ubuntu Desktop or Server edition to try some things out before your hardware arrives. I really recommend getting comfortable with this bit before moving on to anything Eth related.\n\nYou'll also probably need to learn about \"port forwarding\". This something you'll likely need to tweak on your router. It basically allows selected connections on your staking box to be made accessible to the wider internet. It's necessary so that nodes can talk to each other properly. Best to look for instructions for your specific router model.\n\nNext is the Eth testnet phase. Goerli is the testnet to use (not one of the older ones like Ropsten). I recommend practicing by installing and setting up 2 execution layer clients (e.g. Geth, Besu, Nethermind, Erigon) and 2 consensus layer clients (e.g. Prysm, Teku, Nimbus, Lodestar, Lighthouse). A) you may find that you much prefer how one works over the other, and B) you never know when one client may develop issues (like Besu did around The Merge). You'll feel much more comfortable knowing how to quickly setup a different one in a pinch. Do this *before* starting to stake, though it's maybe worth practicing switching clients once you've started staking on Goerli. Once you have started, I suggest setting up any monitoring systems you'd like to use (e.g. Prometheus & Grafana, [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in) app) - it'll be easy to swap these over once you're on mainnet. \n\nPractice various things you may encounter like: updating system software, updating Eth clients, checking recovery from expected & unexpected power loss, setting up MEV boost, reinstalling the whole system from scratch, exiting your validator... etc. anything you'd rather not have to deal with first on mainnet! Join the Ethstaker Discord & servers for all Eth clients you're interested in - best places for technical help and qus.\n\nBefore shifting to mainnet, *make sure* you have decided on an approach for securing the private keys to your validator. This has a good overview on the different keys involved [https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/keys/](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/keys/) . Also consider setting up a dedicated address to receive tips / MEV - makes tax calculations easier.\n\nLast suggestion: make copious notes while doing all these steps. Consider writing it up like a guide for yourself. This will help you to learn more effectively AND will make recovering from issues (e.g. having to reinstall) and updating massively easier.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Congrats on clearing the first hurdle!

It would not be all that hard to re-run the calculations, however atm I'm a bit pressed on time. However, I made an analysis on \"fast blocks\" that I decided to exclude from the paper: In the analysis I categorized blocks that were mined faster than {14,13,12,...,1} seconds and ran the analysis exclusively on those. I results were fairly consistent, but changed when the analysis included solely blocks faster than 5 seconds (if I remember correctly). [Zhou et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02228) show that given a 3 seconds network delay their algorithm must detect arbs within 10 seconds, and the authors show that their algo exceeds this when trying to exploit more than 6 arb cycles. I think this also answers your question *\"Can we use your findings to speculate what is the minimum amount of time that the MEV supply chain needs to get blocks in the hands of validators?\"* I've seen that trading firms are starting to explore MEV, and sufficient and efficient computing they could probably do it faster. Unfortunately, MEV has become more than a single-person job, but there is hope to build better and fair software for this as well since the data is open.  \nI do not include any discussion about the Merge in the paper since I have not had time to think about it properly. But, I believe that 12 seconds is more than enough for arbitrageurs to arbitrage away price anomalies within the block (thus from pending txes). In fact, the variance of block time in PoW is very high such that the probability of 2 miners mining a block simultaneously is low. Block times of 1 second, and over 1 minute is not uncommon. Thus, the 12 seconds in PoS may be perfect as it close to the previous average, and not too fast such that the arbs would necessarily extend across blocks.\n\n\\- \"EF\u2019s merge data challenge\" didn't know about that one, seems like applications have closed, but I'll check it out! Thank you!\n\n\\- MEV boost (and other private relays) changed the distribution that you see in Figure 4. In the beginning of the sample arbitrageurs back-run exchange rate changing txes by submitting regular public txes. In the later part of the sample, the arbitrageurs \"copy\" the exchange rate changing txes from the mempool as they are signed and ready to be executed by any miner, create a bundle with their own arb tx, and submit these as a private bundle to the miner, which ensures that the arb back-runs directly after. The arbitrageurs can pay the miner an extra fee through the private relay, such that the bundled txes get executed early in the block. This is what you see in the change in the transaction position distribution. One thing that is interesting here however, is why the arbitrageurs are not sandwiching the txes: Meaning that they could trade before and after the exchange rate changing txes. This would decrease the user experience as the noise traders would get a larger price slippage. In the raw tx data, I observe more arb-sandwiches in the later part of the sample, however I remove them as I only want to look at a very clean set of pure arbs in this analysis. The question stands though, why are there pure arbs and not only sandwiche-arbs? Are some searchers \"so good\" that they are only doing arbs, and not sandwiching? Or are the traders protecting themselves in some way, e.g. by decreasing the slippage tolerance for their trades such that they cannot be sandwiched? I don't have an answer, but there are much interesting stuff in this space, and many questions!\n\n\\- In the beginning miners did not partake in MEV from my understanding, and the term \"miner extractable value\" refers to the value miners could extract. However, this have probably changed, and centralizing power is not good in this setting. I think that by trying to decentralizing MEV as much as possible we get a more fair system. I don't know though how Flashbots\u2019 SUAVE would affect this, but I would love to learn and talk more about it!  \n\n\nThank you!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wow! What amazing comments!

The question stands though, why are there pure arbs and not only sandwiche-arbs? Are some searchers &quot;so good&quot; that they are only doing arbs, and not sandwiching? Or are the traders protecting themselves in some way, e.g. by decreasing the slippage tolerance for their trades such that they cannot be sandwiched? I don&#39;t have an answer, but there are much interesting stuff in this space, and many questions!</p>\n\n<p>- In the beginning miners did not partake in MEV from my understanding, and the term &quot;miner extractable value&quot; refers to the value miners could extract. However, this have probably changed, and centralizing power is not good in this setting. I think that by trying to decentralizing MEV as much as possible we get a more fair system. I don&#39;t know though how Flashbots\u2019 SUAVE would affect this, but I would love to learn and talk more about it!  </p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-02 12:03:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iynv7yf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zadbqz","parent_id":"t1_iym7iy0","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/OyuruKemono","body":">why are there pure arbs and not only sandwiche-arbs?

Some examples include:*\n\n1. *Developing new machine learning algorithms that are more efficient and effective at learning from data, by incorporating insights from neuroscience on how the brain processes and learns from information.*\n2. *Investigating the neural mechanisms underlying human learning and memory, and using this knowledge to develop more effective algorithms for natural language processing and machine translation.*\n3. *Developing new techniques for visualizing and analyzing complex data sets, by incorporating insights from neuroscience on how the brain processes and interprets visual information.*\n4. *Investigating the neural basis of human creativity, and using this knowledge to develop algorithms that can generate novel and creative ideas.*\n5. *Developing new computational models of the brain that can simulate brain function and help us better understand how the brain works.*\n6. *Investigating the potential applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in computer science, such as using BCIs to control computers or assist with decision-making in artificial intelligence systems.*\n\nI mean all points are probably borrowed from papers that are about this already, but still it's ability to comprehend any question and provide such great answers is remarkable\n\nEdit: Even more impressive example:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n**What are the challenges for governance within a DAO?**  \n\n\nThere are several challenges associated with governance within a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Some of the most significant challenges include:\r  \n\r\n\n1. *Ensuring that all members of the DAO have an equal say in decision-making: In a traditional organization, decision-making power is often concentrated in the hands of a small group of leaders or executives. In a DAO, all members of the organization are able to participate in decision-making, but this can make it difficult to reach consensus and make effective decisions.*\r  \n\n2. *Managing conflicts of interest: In a traditional organization, conflicts of interest can be managed through clear policies and procedures, as well as oversight by independent board members or other neutral parties. In a DAO, conflicts of interest may be more difficult to identify and manage, as all members of the organization are equally involved in decision-making.*\r  \n\r\n3. *Protecting the security and integrity of the organization: In a traditional organization, the security of the organization's assets and systems is managed by a dedicated team of security professionals. In a DAO, the security of the organization is decentralized and relies on the security of the underlying blockchain technology. This can make it more difficult to protect against cyber attacks and other threats.*\r  \n\r\n4. *Ensuring transparency and accountability: In a traditional organization, transparency and accountability are ensured through regular reporting and disclosure of information to stakeholders. In a DAO, transparency and accountability may be more difficult to achieve, as the decentralized nature of the organization can make it difficult to track and report on activities and decision-making.*\r  \n\r\n5. *Dealing with changes in membership and leadership: In a traditional organization, changes in membership and leadership are managed through clearly defined processes and policies. In a DAO, changes in membership and leadership may be more difficult to manage, as the decentralized nature of the organization can make it difficult to enforce rules and policies.*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s pretty insane honestly.

Some examples include:</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>Developing new machine learning algorithms that are more efficient and effective at learning from data, by incorporating insights from neuroscience on how the brain processes and learns from information.</em></li>\n<li><em>Investigating the neural mechanisms underlying human learning and memory, and using this knowledge to develop more effective algorithms for natural language processing and machine translation.</em></li>\n<li><em>Developing new techniques for visualizing and analyzing complex data sets, by incorporating insights from neuroscience on how the brain processes and interprets visual information.</em></li>\n<li><em>Investigating the neural basis of human creativity, and using this knowledge to develop algorithms that can generate novel and creative ideas.</em></li>\n<li><em>Developing new computational models of the brain that can simulate brain function and help us better understand how the brain works.</em></li>\n<li><em>Investigating the potential applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in computer science, such as using BCIs to control computers or assist with decision-making in artificial intelligence systems.</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I mean all points are probably borrowed from papers that are about this already, but still it&#39;s ability to comprehend any question and provide such great answers is remarkable</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Even more impressive example:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the challenges for governance within a DAO?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>There are several challenges associated with governance within a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Some of the most significant challenges include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><em>Ensuring that all members of the DAO have an equal say in decision-making: In a traditional organization, decision-making power is often concentrated in the hands of a small group of leaders or executives. In a DAO, all members of the organization are able to participate in decision-making, but this can make it difficult to reach consensus and make effective decisions.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Managing conflicts of interest: In a traditional organization, conflicts of interest can be managed through clear policies and procedures, as well as oversight by independent board members or other neutral parties. In a DAO, conflicts of interest may be more difficult to identify and manage, as all members of the organization are equally involved in decision-making.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Protecting the security and integrity of the organization: In a traditional organization, the security of the organization&#39;s assets and systems is managed by a dedicated team of security professionals. In a DAO, the security of the organization is decentralized and relies on the security of the underlying blockchain technology. This can make it more difficult to protect against cyber attacks and other threats.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Ensuring transparency and accountability: In a traditional organization, transparency and accountability are ensured through regular reporting and disclosure of information to stakeholders. In a DAO, transparency and accountability may be more difficult to achieve, as the decentralized nature of the organization can make it difficult to track and report on activities and decision-making.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Dealing with changes in membership and leadership: In a traditional organization, changes in membership and leadership are managed through clearly defined processes and policies. In a DAO, changes in membership and leadership may be more difficult to manage, as the decentralized nature of the organization can make it difficult to enforce rules and policies.</em></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-02 03:13:18","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-12-02 03:18:08","id":"iyly1up","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zadbqz","parent_id":"t1_iylv00y","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/OkDragonfruit1929","body":"I think the Google engineer that was ridiculed for declaring AI has become sentient was right.

Some of the most significant challenges include:*\n\n1. *Ensuring that all members of the DAO have an equal say in decision-making: In a traditional organization, decision-making power is often concentrated in the hands of a small group of leaders or executives. In a DAO, all members of the organization are able to participate in decision-making, but this can make it difficult to reach consensus and make effective decisions.*\n2. *Managing conflicts of interest: In a traditional organization, conflicts of interest can be managed through clear policies and procedures, as well as oversight by independent board members or other neutral parties. In a DAO, conflicts of interest may be more difficult to identify and manage, as all members of the organization are equally involved in decision-making.*\n3. *Protecting the security and integrity of the organization: In a traditional organization, the security of the organization's assets and systems is managed by a dedicated team of security professionals. In a DAO, the security of the organization is decentralized and relies on the security of the underlying blockchain technology. This can make it more difficult to protect against cyber attacks and other threats.*\n4. *Ensuring transparency and accountability: In a traditional organization, transparency and accountability are ensured through regular reporting and disclosure of information to stakeholders. In a DAO, transparency and accountability may be more difficult to achieve, as the decentralized nature of the organization can make it difficult to track and report on activities and decision-making.*\n5. *Dealing with changes in membership and leadership: In a traditional organization, changes in membership and leadership are managed through clearly defined processes and policies. In a DAO, changes in membership and leadership may be more difficult to manage, as the decentralized nature of the organization can make it difficult to enforce rules and policies.*\n\n**What are some strategies to mitigate these risks?**\n\n*There are several strategies that can be used to mitigate the risks associated with governance within a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Some of the most effective strategies include:*\n\n1. *Developing clear rules and policies for decision-making and conflict resolution: In order to ensure that all members of the DAO have an equal say in decision-making, it is important to develop clear rules and policies for how decisions will be made and how conflicts will be resolved. These rules and policies should be transparent and fair, and should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain relevant and effective.*\n2. *Implementing robust security measures: In order to protect the security and integrity of the DAO, it is important to implement robust security measures, such as strong encryption and secure storage of sensitive information. It may also be necessary to regularly audit the security of the organization's systems and assets, and to implement security updates and patches as needed.*\n3. *Establishing mechanisms for transparency and accountability: In order to ensure transparency and accountability within the DAO, it is important to establish mechanisms for regularly reporting on the organization's activities and decision-making. This could include publishing regular updates on the DAO's website or social media channels, as well as providing access to information and data on the organization's operations.*\n4. *Developing processes for managing changes in membership and leadership: In order to effectively manage changes in membership and leadership, it is important to develop clear processes and policies for how these changes will be handled. This could include rules for how new members can join the organization, as well as procedures for how leadership roles will be filled and rotated.*\n5. *Engaging external experts and advisors: In order to address complex governance challenges within a DAO, it may be useful to engage external experts and advisors who can provide guidance and support. This could include lawyers, accountants, and other professionals who have expertise in decentralized governance and can help the organization navigate complex legal and regulatory issues.*\n\nHigh school / college kids never have to write their own reports again.

I've plucked a comment from /r/cardano that attempts to explain the ways in which Cardano is better than Ethereum. Your job is to explain why each bullet point is misleading or wrong.
