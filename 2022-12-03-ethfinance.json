Purple means taking the middle ground instead of the red or blue sides.\n* **CryptoKitties**: One of the first NFT blockchain games (2017)\n* **Ethereum Classic**: The original Ethereum blockchain pre-DAO hack fork\n* **Vitalik proof of life Twitter post**: vbuterin used an Ethereum transaction to prove that he was still alive after a 4chan hoax said he had died (2017)\n* **Code is Law**: The idea that code is absolute when determining the canonical state of the blockchain. If layer 0 wants to break the code, it needs to fork.\n\n####**Berg Level 3**\n\n* **Ethereum Foundation EdCon Rap**: Probably best if you don't know. A cringey Ethereum rap song at EdCon 2019 featuring vbuterin. (Plasma chains did not survive)\n* **Ethereum Parity Wallet Hacks**: A pair of really bad vulnerabilities in the Parity Wallet that got exploited in Jul 2017 and Nov 2017. In the [first one](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7/), **delegatecall** was exploited to take ownership of the contract. It was such a newbie error (possibly inside job). In the [second one](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/parity-wallet-hack-reloaded/), **delegatecall** was exploited again, but in a more sophisticated attack. The attacker gained access to the Parity wallet and then later self-destructed it. If they had just implemented onlyowner modifier correctly like how you're taught in Solidity 101, both of these could've been avoided.\n* **Smoking flirting and talking prices**: Refers to some random 2018 Twitter post.\n* **LSD fueled orgies**: A twitter post by Amir Taaki about how Ethereum has devolved into people who just participate in LSD fueled orgies.\n\n####**Berg Level 4**\n\n* **State Channels**: Ethereum Plasma chains and Bitcoin Lightning network use state channels. Was eventually considered this a dead-end technology for Layer 2 scaling in favor of rollups.\n* **2017 Shanghai Attacks**: Refers to the [spam attacks](https://tjayrush.medium.com/defeating-the-ethereum-ddos-attacks-d3d773a9a063) that created millions of useless accounts during the 2017 DevCon 2.\n* **April Fools Ethereum/Dogecoin Subreddit Swap**: I think this happened in either 2016 or 2017\n* **ProgPoW**: A failed proposal to change Ethereum's mining algorithm in early 2020 to be ASIC-resistant and only use GPUs.\n* **\"weeks not months\"**: Joe Lubin said this on stage about when Eth 2.0 would launch, then it didn't for another few years.\n\n####**Berg Level 5**\n\n* **EtherDelta**: The SEC targeted the EtherDelta DEX as an unregistered Exchange in 2018. This killed off keeping order books on a centralized server. Uniswap and others that weren't targeted use AMMs and smart contracts.\n* **White Hat Group (WHG)**: The hackers who drained the funds from the Parity wallet in the July 2017 attack, supposedly to save it.\n* **EIP-999**: A hard-fork proposal to restore the Parity wallet contract after the hacker self-destructed it. Never passed.\n* **Olympic**: The first Ethereum testnet back in 2015\n* **2019 Block Rewards Debates**: Debates about reducing block reward from 3 ETH to 2 in the Constantinople update\n* **Whisper**: An early P2P messaging app on Ethereum. Deprecated.\n\n####**Berg Level 6**\n\n* **Mana EIP**: Refers to this vbuterin 2015 [EIP](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/29) to rename 'gas' to 'mana'\n* **Dogethereum Bridge**: 2015 or 2016 DAO (one of the first) to bridge Ethereum and Dogecoin blockchains.\n* **Casper CBC**: The original ETH 2.0/3.0 design for the Casper \"Correct By Construction\" protocol for PoS Ethereum finality. Later replaced by Casper FFG and Gasper for The Merge.\n* **Ethereum Alarm Clock**: An old protocol to help schedule transactions for the future. Was hacked in 2022 7 years after the contract was released when an exploit was finally found in the gas refund mechanism.\n* **Two Wooks**: Old inside joke for \"2 weeks\" dating to 2016\n\n####**Berg Level 7**\n\n* **Accidental RipeMD160 precompile deletion**: Because of a discrepancy between how geth and Parity deleted accounts during the post-Shanghai attacks cleanup fork, it [ended up deleting a precompile](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/716#issuecomment-330824096)\n* **ether.camp / Roman Mandeleil**: Roman was one of the earliest Ethereum protocol devs and build a team to made ethereumJ, a Java based Ethereum client. ether.camp was a block explorer with amazing features built by the same team. ether.camp also did a hackathon (Hudson's team won a top prize) that had some controversy around vote manipulation. Roman eventually launched HKG - HackerGold token and then left the ecosystem shortly after. We heard he had cancer, and he may have, but he is still alive today and completely out of the ecosystem. The rest of his team were very successful and vital in Eth2 development.\n* **AlethZero**: The first Desktop GUI contract editor that include a simulated blockchain to test your contracts and an interface to test them on a webpage.\n* **SUICIDE OPCODE Renaming EIP**: EIP-6 renamed the SUICIDE opcode to SELFDESTRUCT (for destroying contracts) since the word \"suicide\" should not be taken lightly.\n\n####**Berg Level 8**\n\nIf you recognize any of these, you may secretly be a core dev or part of the community since 2015. I suspect that some of these are esoteric inside jokes that mortals like us will not know. Hudson filled in a lot of the blanks for me.\n\n* **Andrew Miller predicted The DAO hack**: About a year or so before The DAO hack and launch of The DAO, Andrew Miller, who was part of the original team from Least Authority who audited Ethereum in 2015, posted in the Ethereum forum about re-entrancy bugs in contracts. At the time there were no live contracts that had this pattern, and Gavin Wood dismissed Andrew's concerns at the time. These were the same kind of bugs that were exploited in the DAO hack.\n* **EthereumJS Padding Bug**: There was [a 2016 bug in an ethereumJS library that MyEtherWallet](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/47nkoi/psa_check_your_ethaddressorg_wallets_and_any/) and others used to generate addresses for their users. The bug made you lose ether and [affected some people](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/48rt6n/using_myetherwalletcom_just_burned_me_for/).\n* **Mike Trout**: Mike Trout was a prolific, odd person in the Ethereum ecosystem around the time of Devcon2 (2017). He claimed to have thought of Ethereum before Vitalik or something and was a zany character. He had a weird YouTube channel, made the $FUCK token iirc, and did a cannonball in a rooftop hot tub at the venue hotel for Devcon 2 in Shanghai. As they say, \"You can't keep a trout out of water!\"\n* **Mutan**: An old deprecated C-like language for Ethereum prior to Solidity\n* **Joe Lubin Bahamas Recording Studio**: Lubin is a cofounder of ConsenSys and Ethereum.

Purple means taking the middle ground instead of the red or blue sides.</li>\n<li><strong>CryptoKitties</strong>: One of the first NFT blockchain games (2017)</li>\n<li><strong>Ethereum Classic</strong>: The original Ethereum blockchain pre-DAO hack fork</li>\n<li><strong>Vitalik proof of life Twitter post</strong>: vbuterin used an Ethereum transaction to prove that he was still alive after a 4chan hoax said he had died (2017)</li>\n<li><strong>Code is Law</strong>: The idea that code is absolute when determining the canonical state of the blockchain. If layer 0 wants to break the code, it needs to fork.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4><strong>Berg Level 3</strong></h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereum Foundation EdCon Rap</strong>: Probably best if you don&#39;t know. A cringey Ethereum rap song at EdCon 2019 featuring vbuterin. (Plasma chains did not survive)</li>\n<li><strong>Ethereum Parity Wallet Hacks</strong>: A pair of really bad vulnerabilities in the Parity Wallet that got exploited in Jul 2017 and Nov 2017. In the <a href=\"https://blog.openzeppelin.com/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7/\">first one</a>, <strong>delegatecall</strong> was exploited to take ownership of the contract. It was such a newbie error (possibly inside job). In the <a href=\"https://blog.openzeppelin.com/parity-wallet-hack-reloaded/\">second one</a>, <strong>delegatecall</strong> was exploited again, but in a more sophisticated attack. The attacker gained access to the Parity wallet and then later self-destructed it. If they had just implemented onlyowner modifier correctly like how you&#39;re taught in Solidity 101, both of these could&#39;ve been avoided.</li>\n<li><strong>Smoking flirting and talking prices</strong>: Refers to some random 2018 Twitter post.</li>\n<li><strong>LSD fueled orgies</strong>: A twitter post by Amir Taaki about how Ethereum has devolved into people who just participate in LSD fueled orgies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4><strong>Berg Level 4</strong></h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>State Channels</strong>: Ethereum Plasma chains and Bitcoin Lightning network use state channels.

This killed off keeping order books on a centralized server. Uniswap and others that weren&#39;t targeted use AMMs and smart contracts.</li>\n<li><strong>White Hat Group (WHG)</strong>: The hackers who drained the funds from the Parity wallet in the July 2017 attack, supposedly to save it.</li>\n<li><strong>EIP-999</strong>: A hard-fork proposal to restore the Parity wallet contract after the hacker self-destructed it. Never passed.</li>\n<li><strong>Olympic</strong>: The first Ethereum testnet back in 2015</li>\n<li><strong>2019 Block Rewards Debates</strong>: Debates about reducing block reward from 3 ETH to 2 in the Constantinople update</li>\n<li><strong>Whisper</strong>: An early P2P messaging app on Ethereum.

Later replaced by Casper FFG and Gasper for The Merge.</li>\n<li><strong>Ethereum Alarm Clock</strong>: An old protocol to help schedule transactions for the future. Was hacked in 2022 7 years after the contract was released when an exploit was finally found in the gas refund mechanism.</li>\n<li><strong>Two Wooks</strong>: Old inside joke for &quot;2 weeks&quot; dating to 2016</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4><strong>Berg Level 7</strong></h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accidental RipeMD160 precompile deletion</strong>: Because of a discrepancy between how geth and Parity deleted accounts during the post-Shanghai attacks cleanup fork, it <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/716#issuecomment-330824096\">ended up deleting a precompile</a></li>\n<li><strong>ether.camp / Roman Mandeleil</strong>: Roman was one of the earliest Ethereum protocol devs and build a team to made ethereumJ, a Java based Ethereum client. ether.camp was a block explorer with amazing features built by the same team. ether.camp also did a hackathon (Hudson&#39;s team won a top prize) that had some controversy around vote manipulation. Roman eventually launched HKG - HackerGold token and then left the ecosystem shortly after. We heard he had cancer, and he may have, but he is still alive today and completely out of the ecosystem. The rest of his team were very successful and vital in Eth2 development.</li>\n<li><strong>AlethZero</strong>: The first Desktop GUI contract editor that include a simulated blockchain to test your contracts and an interface to test them on a webpage.</li>\n<li><strong>SUICIDE OPCODE Renaming EIP</strong>: EIP-6 renamed the SUICIDE opcode to SELFDESTRUCT (for destroying contracts) since the word &quot;suicide&quot; should not be taken lightly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4><strong>Berg Level 8</strong></h4>\n\n<p>If you recognize any of these, you may secretly be a core dev or part of the community since 2015. I suspect that some of these are esoteric inside jokes that mortals like us will not know. Hudson filled in a lot of the blanks for me.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Andrew Miller predicted The DAO hack</strong>: About a year or so before The DAO hack and launch of The DAO, Andrew Miller, who was part of the original team from Least Authority who audited Ethereum in 2015, posted in the Ethereum forum about re-entrancy bugs in contracts. At the time there were no live contracts that had this pattern, and Gavin Wood dismissed Andrew&#39;s concerns at the time. These were the same kind of bugs that were exploited in the DAO hack.</li>\n<li><strong>EthereumJS Padding Bug</strong>: There was <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/47nkoi/psa_check_your_ethaddressorg_wallets_and_any/\">a 2016 bug in an ethereumJS library that MyEtherWallet</a> and others used to generate addresses for their users. The bug made you lose ether and <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/48rt6n/using_myetherwalletcom_just_burned_me_for/\">affected some people</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Mike Trout</strong>: Mike Trout was a prolific, odd person in the Ethereum ecosystem around the time of Devcon2 (2017). He claimed to have thought of Ethereum before Vitalik or something and was a zany character. He had a weird YouTube channel, made the $FUCK token iirc, and did a cannonball in a rooftop hot tub at the venue hotel for Devcon 2 in Shanghai. As they say, &quot;You can&#39;t keep a trout out of water!&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Mutan</strong>: An old deprecated C-like language for Ethereum prior to Solidity</li>\n<li><strong>Joe Lubin Bahamas Recording Studio</strong>: Lubin is a cofounder of ConsenSys and Ethereum.
