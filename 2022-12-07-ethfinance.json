So I followed up and asked when can I expect that to increase so my node can actually start doing stuff. Someone said it won't because you need delegations, so they told me to make a post in their subreddit and list your specs, internet connection speed, why you are running the node, what you want to get out of it, your long term plans, how long you've been running it for, etc etc.\n\nThat concept blows my mind, why on a so called decentralised network do I need to advertise my machine?
