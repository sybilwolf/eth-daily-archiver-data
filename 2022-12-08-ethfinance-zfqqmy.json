While I kind of get the principle of QF as an advanced funding strategy, I don't understand in this particular effort how donors can evaluate the likelihood that the projects will have any impact.  At least the two public health projects (and the grantee websites) are unclear as to the specific project activities, expected outcomes, or the organization's track record in completing projects.  I worry that donors will just be attracted based on the quality of the marketing materials rather than the likelihood of producing actual social good.

So in that case it\u2019s an amount that would\u2019ve been sold that now won\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s a little different from a buyback, which is how it\u2019s framed often, because of the supply elasticity curve for crypto, which I understand to be quite steep. So if it really were buy pressure, $1 of eth bot might move the market cap by $10 because you have to find people to actually sell it, whereas with the burn, $1 of burn is just $1 of eth that will never get sold, so the market cap kinda just sits there.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s my understanding, anyway, which probably helps counter some of the more hyper optimistic price projections we saw a few years ago. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit pedantic or if it\u2019s wrong (I\u2019m wrong about a lot of stuff) so I\u2019d be happy to hear other opinions.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, the supply/demand elasticity steepness shows why going off of pow was so critical to having a stable price - the constant sell pressure was tough to keep up with and could seriously dump the price if demand petered out.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-08 18:22:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"izh97db","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zfqqmy","parent_id":"t1_izgw2v7","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"1.65% inflation is not \u201cinflating hard as fuck\u201d by any reasonable metric, some statements are in fact not true.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>1.65% inflation is not \u201cinflating hard as fuck\u201d by any reasonable metric, some statements are in fact not true.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-08 18:28:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"izha35s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zfqqmy","parent_id":"t1_izgw2v7","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/gand_ji","body":"Compared to ETH's 0.01%, 1.6% is pretty hard as fuck (160x)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Compared to ETH&#39;s 0.01%, 1.6% is pretty hard as fuck (160x)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-08 19:15:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"izhfyx2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zfqqmy","parent_id":"t1_izha35s","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"But compared to America's 7.7%, 1.6% is very not much (20%).\n\nComparing essentially zero to anything is not a good faith argument.

This reduces the complexity in the case of an error and would simplify the bug hunting. On average you only propose a block once every 2 Months, so being without MEV-Boost for a short time should be ok. </p>\n\n<p>If you have already active validators you can use they relayers API to check if your validator is registered in the network. Here is an example for bloxroute max profit:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bloxroute.max-profit.blxrbdn.com/relay/v1/data/validator_registration?pubkey=0x800096c40c05d8288f183869bcf1068565aef547455cc53ab69182a39a3e6a6fe9f5c163f42cb69d636e60639294d65f\">https://bloxroute.max-profit.blxrbdn.com/relay/v1/data/validator_registration?pubkey=0x800096c40c05d8288f183869bcf1068565aef547455cc53ab69182a39a3e6a6fe9f5c163f42cb69d636e60639294d65f</a></p>\n\n<p>Just replace the pubkey of the validator in the link with your own. Other relayers use the same API, so you only have to change the first part of the linkt. And yes I just picked a totally random pubkey of a validator in the link. Not my own one.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-08 01:51:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"izdo372","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zfqqmy","parent_id":"t1_izdn4tn","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Maswasnos","body":"For the degens out there, Vesta is increasing the VST mint cap on their GLP vault over the next two weeks to $10 million.
