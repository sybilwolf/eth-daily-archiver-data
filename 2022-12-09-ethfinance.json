I've got my own ideas about who else to nominate, but as I'm representing you lot, then I wanted to gather some of your opinions on who we would like to get the position? \n\nIn the next season they will be responsible for allocating 10m OP to Public Goods, so it's a pretty important decision. We can only choose people who have made a [delegate commitment](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235), but there are no limits on how much OP they should have delegated to them or anything.

Prior to Optimism, this was the only Ethereum community I spend much time in and the only one where I&#39;m vaguely recognized, so I assume that pretty much everyone who assigned me their voting power is from here. As such, I come to you today with a question...</p>\n\n<p>Optimism&#39;s governance is opening up the long awaited second half - <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/wqk1Yeyn2OhV9paDzbRXvQ0m0JYDu2npbSkMClwk1rY\">the Citizen House</a>, which will be in charge of directing retroactive public goods funding and will work on a &#39;one-human: one vote&#39; system, rather than delegated token weight like the &#39;Token House&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Details of how citizen&#39;s are going to be selected is available <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-badgeholder-election-information/4195\">here</a>, but the long and short of it is that because I&#39;ve got over 0.5% of the delegated vote, I can nominate 2x other <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235?u=minimalgravitas\">delegates</a> to become citizen badgeholders.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-badgeholder-nominations/4196/6?u=minimalgravitas\">already</a> put one name forward - Lefteris, who has been a constant advocate for open source software and has contributed a lot to Optimism governance so far. I&#39;ve got my own ideas about who else to nominate, but as I&#39;m representing you lot, then I wanted to gather some of your opinions on who we would like to get the position? </p>\n\n<p>In the next season they will be responsible for allocating 10m OP to Public Goods, so it&#39;s a pretty important decision. We can only choose people who have made a <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235\">delegate commitment</a>, but there are no limits on how much OP they should have delegated to them or anything.

OG ass mufuckin SuperPhiz ain\u2019t no monkey in a clown suit!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I occasionally end up in this weird place where I feel like a marketing agency.. I have even joked that Superphiz has retired and been replaced by a marketing team. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh man.. I hear ya, that <em>weird place</em> is where I live.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to set the record straight so I can continue to move forward feeling comfortable with my role. I DO have financial entanglements with EthStaker, the Ethereum Foundation, Rocket Pool, and POAP; these are organizations that have been dear to me for a very long time, and I\u2019ve openly celebrated their positive influences in the Ethereum ecosystem for years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We already knew.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most important thing that I can say to anyone is that I am a fully independent operator, and no one is allowed to put words in my mouth. I will absolutely never parrot anyone\u2019s thoughts or allow them to suggest what I might say. I do not do ANY promotional content, and I never will. Literally every word that comes out of my mouth, every game that I create or engage in is my own way of having fun and engaging with communities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We could tell. I mean \u2026 I\u2019m still happy you said it out loud tho.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I never want to lose the organic feel of the fun that I have, and if I did lose that fun I wouldn\u2019t have the energy to be here. My personality type is ENTP, often regarded as Inventor or Promoter, and that\u2019s pretty much what you get from me. Also, as an ENTP, I hate being managed or controlled by anyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, your fun is better than organic. It\u2019s 100% all natural, pasture raised, free range fun.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m saying all of this now because I suddenly realized that I may be regarded as an influencer in this space, and it\u2019s so important to me that people recognize that means \u201cphiz encourages people to do the right thing\u201d and not \u201cphiz is trying to sell you something\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Phiz. Buddy. Friend. Potential future snuggler. You know something else about ENTPs? Their worst fear is being inadequate or incapable. We love you Phiz, exactly as you are, whether it\u2019s as an influencer or a salesman. Keep following your heart and we\u2019ll keep following you friend.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth telling you that I\u2019m chatting with a good actor in the ecosystem about a potential collaboration. The most that I can offer them is a willingness to give thought to the very good thing that they\u2019re developing; if they insist on engagement metrics or branded content of any type, I just won\u2019t do it. If you want to ask questions, please feel free and I\u2019ll answer without identifying them\u2026 all I will tell you is that they are seeking to serve the ecosystem and I support that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See, exactly why we\u2019re never worried about what you\u2019re selling.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, I\u2019m very proud of everything I\u2019ve done to bring value and build communities. I have done this kind of work for free for years, and I\u2019m not mad if one of the benefits I receive now is the ability to pay my bills.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Make some money friend, just stick to your heart and none of us will ever be mad about it.  You\u2019re worth it. You\u2019re more than adequate enough.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019d also like to remind you that I am, and always will be committed to the success of Ethereum and the beacon chain.
