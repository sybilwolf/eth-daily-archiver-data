However, this vulnerability is an intentionally-placed bait used to entice attackers. It's a trap by devs for other devs.\n\nThere's a [good older summary here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-phenomena-of-smart-contract-honeypots-755c1f943f7b) that covers many of the older ones mentioned in /r/ethdev and another [semi-updated summary of the other known honeypots](https://medium.com/@Knownsec_Blockchain_Lab/knownsec-blockchain-lab-interesting-smart-contract-honeypot-analysis-part-2-d3d63c59ebd2). They're fun to study because it's like solving a 2-layer puzzle: find the obvious vulnerability, and then find the trap.\n\n**They all tend to have certain patterns**:\n\n1. There is **a bait vulnerability**. Sometimes this is an obvious typo, or a known common vulnerability like a re-entrancy bug.\n2. There is **a requirement to add more funds** in order to exploit the vulnerability. This is usually a giant red flag that it's a trap when there's no practical explanation for that requirement.\n3. There is **a trap** that's harder to find than the vulnerability. Usually something easy to miss unless you're really paying attention to the code. There is often a seemingly random function placed in the contract without a purpose. That's usually how the trap designer secretly modifies the contract's variable.\n\n**Some common traps**:\n\n1. **Constructors**: Constructors are functions that run only when the contract in initially deployed. People sometimes forget that constructors can set state variables in the contract. On Etherscan, you'll sometimes see contract code published as a \"Similar match\" instead of \"Exact match\". That means the published code on the block explorer does not reveal the actual constructor function.\n1. **Secret calls by other contracts**: Contract variables can be secretly set by calls from other contracts. If you look at a bait contract on a block explorer like Etherscan, it will not reveal whether other contracts have called it to set variables.\n  1. For example, Contract <Secret_Manipulator> could set a state variable on contract <Honeypot>. You won't be able to find any records of that change by studying <Honeypot> on Etherscan. You have to have prior knowledge about <Secret_Manipulator> to find the transaction record. Unless the scammer is careless and left a trail, you won't be able to find it. And even then, the <Secret_Manipulator> contract is always left as closed source so you will never know exactly what it did.\n1. **Obfuscated code**. There are contracts with hundreds of lines of useless code, but one of them hides the true function of the contract.\n1. **Older code** that use previous compiler versions of Solidity have deprecated mechanisms and code syntax that might trick newer developers. I can still deploy new contracts using old versions from years ago. Examples of tricky changes:\n  1. [State variable shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing): In contracts before 0.6.0, you could have the same variable name in the base contract and the derived contract. Even though they have the same name, they are different variables. Traps often abused state variable shadowing for the \"owner\" variable, leading you to think the owner was someone else. Newer devs likely aren't aware of this vulnerability.\n  1. [Integer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow) and underflow existed before 0.8.0. If an integer increases above a certain size, it would overflow into a negative integer (or wrap back to 0 for unsigned integers). Older contracts had to use SafeMath functions to prevent overflow/underflow, which don't exist on newer contracts.\n\n**How to avoid getting scammed by Honeypots**:\n\n1. First off, you shouldn't be attacking vulnerabilities in other people's contracts unless you are a decent Solidity dev\n1. Always thoroughly test the code in a dev environment first. Use the same Solidity version as the contract when it was deployed.\n1. Any contract arbitrarily requiring to add large amounts of funds in order to interact with it is likely a trap\n1. Remember that contracts can be called by other contracts without leaving an obvious record. Don't trust the block explorer.\n1. Watch out for the Solidity version. Be careful with **OLD contracts**. Some traps require you to know knowledge about previous Solidity versions when compiler behavior was different.\n\n**Edit**: I've posted updated/cleaned-up versions of my 4 favorites at https://github.com/mal-plankton/solidity/tree/main/Scams\n\nThey also include explanations in the code for how the exploits work.\n\n[**Substack version** with more details](https://mplankton.substack.com/p/rediscovering-smart-contract-honeypots)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been spending much of last week going down a rabbit hole studying <strong>smart contract Honeypots</strong> for devs. There were a lot of them mentioned on <a href=\"/r/ethdev\">/r/ethdev</a> 4-5 years ago, and but not many mentioned afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Honeypots are contracts that seemingly have a vulnerability.
