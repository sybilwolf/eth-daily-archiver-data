I actually made the decision to do solo staking back in summer, when u/superphiz appeared on the bankless episode talking. I had been thinking about it before, but since I am a stupid human being when it comes to tech usually, I never followed up. By coincidence (a rather random tweet, but made by a fellow EVM) I found dappnode and got even more lucky when I saw that for Black Friday they had some great offers, so I just made a quick decision, ordered and posted about it to finally get this done. So posting had two goals: 1. Making sure I have to follow up, cause people know about it. I think u/bob-rossi was in a similar spot, he even asked for an accountability partnership and weekly updates, which was a perfect outcome for me. 2. Hopefully being able to say in the end \"it wasn't that hard, more people should do it, if I can do it\". This post will pick up the second goal, so if you're interested in solo staking... here we go:\u00a0  \nTo begin with: My testnet validator seems to be running for over 24 hours now. So apparently I made it! Was it hard? No, not really! Was it easy? Also no. How can it be easy and hard? Let me phrase it this way: It wasn't hard (in hindsight), but only because I knew it was testnet I kept going. There were at least two steps I wouldn't have made if real ETH was on the line.\u00a0  \nAs I said I am using dappnode hardware and hence also software. It was \"advertised\" as \"as easy as it gets\", so everything I am writing here is only feedback for dappnode. \n\nThe first steps are rather easy, but I managed to eff up twice in the process. So let me start with this: Even if you have watched videos about how everything works, don't move fast. Don't click fast. Read through everything. After creating a user/pw for dappnode you receive a recovery token. I think because of a learnt behavior\u00a0I clicked too fast: instead of copying the token I was taken to the next page. Please don't get me wrong, that was stupid and way too fast. Maybe a \"insert token\" on the next page to make sure you really have it would be a good security feature in the process. On top my user apparently wasn't registered (I got error messages), so I actually needed the recovery token. :D That's a nightmare for me, but in the end it was good connecting via keyboard/ monitor at least once to see how it works. So I recovered/ found the token, and kept going. \n\nThe next steps I basically followed the videos by oooly that u/cryptomoon2020 posted some days ago. First of all: these videos are a great help. I think only using the documentation from dappnode wouldn't have been enough and the \"tutorial videos\" from dappnode itself are old and probably out dated. Generally speaking the next steps are rather easy, because you're downloading the clients. One thing that was odd is that the consensus client is in sync rather fast, but loses sync as well. This stops once the execution client is synced. And geth needs some time... but nothing critical here, once that was synced I was good. Biggest issue here is that there is no forecast how long syncing takes. \n\nThe two steps I wouldn't have made if it wasn't testnet were the following: \n\n1. The video by oooly and also dappnode says that you need to open some ports if your router doesn't feature upnp. Mine does, but dappnode still said ports weren't open. I added them manually. dappnode still says they aren't working. (Narrator: apparently they were, cause it's still that way, but testnet is running)\n2. Since client diversity was very important for me I wanted to go with a minority client and teku seemed like a good choice. But there are no tutorial videos for teku (at least no video I found). And on top dappnode changed their software and the whole process shown in the videos changed.   \nSo I did what I thought was everything I needed to do and made the deposit and apparently that worked, but again: there was no good documentation and it wouldn't have felt comfortable going forward if this was mainnet. (Narrator: it really was only uploading the file + password and everything else seems to be managed by the dappnode software). \n\nSo my feedback is: it is rather easy to setup a validator with dappnode. If I can do, you can do it! But there is documentation/ tutorials/ videos etc. missing, especially if we want more people to use minority clients. You really need to spend some time to set it up properly and investigate/ look up a lot of things, because there is not a single source for the whole process. I think paying someone for good tutorials for all clients and each and every step would be a very smart investment by dappnode/ ethstaker/ ... to further increase solo staking adoption. \n\nOn top I have a lot of questions, maybe some of you can help me out, I'd really appreciate that! \n\n1. People already mentioned that I should let it run for some days and get used to it, I happily do that and will most likely spin the mainnet clients up after christmas. Someone said I should try to \"corrupt\" the clients and understand what I have to do when that happens. How can I do that? What should I do generally? aka what are the most common issues I could run into, how can I simulate them and what's the thing I have to do then? \n2. In the oooly videos he makes some changes to the clients to improve them (e.g. peers). I tried to copy him, but apparently the change only works for prysm. So let me ask in a more general way: What changes should I make with regards to teku? Should I make changes at all for now?\n3. I have 100% executed attestations, but only 88% effectiveness (and it's falling, I started with like 91 or 92 after some hours of being active, it's dropping slightly since then). Why? Is this connected to \"optimal inclusion distance\"? \n4. For the attestations you get rewards. My rewards are usually 12k, some 11k, some 9k, but I also had 2k gwei. What's the reason for the low (2k and 9k) epochs? It doesn't seem to be connected to opt.incl.dist., cause even what its 0 I have lower rewards and sometimes I have 3 but rewards are 12k+. Could someone explain this to me?\n5. Is 3 and 4 connected? Is 3 and 4 connected to not having made changes to the consensus clients and (inbound) peers?\n6. I activated all MEV boost relays. This means the highest bidding relay wins, right? I don't have to pick one, but can just pick any combination? \n\nI think that's it for now, but obviously more questions might pop up/ i might have forgotten stuff. Thank you to everyone commenting on my posts. The help offered was incredible, this community is crazy in the best way possible. \n\nI can only recommend setting up a validator. I learned a lot and am sure I will learn more in the next couple of days and weeks. I guess these days looking into rETH also makes a lot of sense, because of the premium, but I have no idea how easy it is in comparison. I went for solo staking cause I wanted to participate in the MEV lottery, maybe that's possible with rETH as well (since I think smoothing is not mandatory? even though I don't understand how rETH holders participate in MEV rewards, is rETH fungible and non-fungible at the same time? is my rETH connected to a certain pool? so many questions...). \n\nWhatever, again, thank you, I hope this post is a motivation to other Benidos and Bob-Rossis out there that always procrastinate.

Because if I can do it, you can do it!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As you are probably all aware of (cause I made a lot of posts about it), I have been setting up my testnet validator last weekend.

Very briefly, verticality is the technical expertise of all service providers specialized into providing a specific product, like water, wheat, flour, pasta and restaurant meals. Horizontality is the broadth of different products that can be offered, like corn being used for food, but also for fuel; flour being used for food, but also for paints. \n\nMost devs and users are focused on the verticality of decentralized cryptocurrencies, but I'll more delve into horizontality, here. \n\nLet's just start by saying Satoshi is brilliant. And many other devs who participated in BTC and ETH development are really bright too. \n\nWhat has been done by Satoshi was about money, a peer-to-peer cash system. But it's only a specific implementation about a specific use case of what has actually been discovered. What has been done is about proving a decentralized consensus. And it's just wild how far and wide it goes. But let's delve more into the reasons about it being wild.\n\nDecentralized consensus is about inventions that are rooted in conventions of interactions between individuals. All these inventions can hugely benefit from a decentralized consensus, for you can use that consensus as a very efficient support for all these inventions. \n\nFor instance, language is such an invention. You have in your mind a copy of existing words (a sort of dictionary), tokens you can assemble with others to create sentences you can send to anyone else in order to convey meaning. You need to share more or less the same dictionary as at least some other individuals in order to use language. You need to learn that dictionary. And the dictionary can't change too often or be too big. And even then, you probably won't share a completely faithful dictionary with absolutely everyone else. \n\nLikewise, money also is such an invention. And when there weren't so many individuals, people from some cultures were used to keeping in their heads who owned the tokens of highest value (which they physically represented as huge carved stones, but which were so heavy to transport they sometimes just left them wherever they were and accounted in their head who owned which stone). Obviously, using only the mind and oral tradition wasn't enough for all uses of money. Scalability was low and storage was error-prone. So, physical, externalized tokens were useful to increase scalability. But it was now prone to another error: forgery. And it lost one property, fungibility, as we could now mark physical tokens and uniquely distinguish them from each others, potentially giving a different to some tokens: collectibles. \n\nClearly, decentralized consensus allows to provide many benefits in verticality. But, as for horizontality, those were just two examples. How many more inventions can we discover and for which we will be able to use a decentralized consensus?\n\nFor instance, we're on the verge of implementing and adopting a map of proofs of wallets recognizing specific meaning of other wallets, like \"here's someone I claim is X\". Yes, identity is an invention that can benefit from decentralized consensus. There is a dictionary of individuals and, for each one of them, there's an attribution of what we call a name, a nationality, a date of birth, a surname, the name of a parent, the certificate of a school diploma, the certificate of a union with someone else, of having finished a course, having visited a place, having reach a high score in that game. And anything else. \n\nFor an institution as well as for an individual, it's wild, since it ensures the whole concept of identity as in \"what I vouch others to be\" becomes an invention just as much as money, without needing any passport (which require rare materials by design of forgery counter-measures), certificate, signature or anything alike and, most of all, without anyone being able to forge it anymore (and thus without needing any expert to recognize and prove authenticity). \n\nBut that's three inventions, so far. What other inventions could we have? I've thought about POAPs and I think we can push the concept further, with literally anyone being able to create unique names that are tied to them (or rather to their wallet) like a kind of scope providing uniqueness without requiring competition between each others for a scarce namespace. Like we could have ENS providing a scope to POAPs and as such, any ENS creating its own unique POAPs the individual can manage however they want. \n\nOr, similarly, unique hashtags.\n\nOr, more wildly, knowkedge as a whole, as a data lake of all experiments. Although, we'd probably need to take cautious steps in that regard, as an individual claiming an experiment isn't the same as an experiment having taken place. \n\nBut, what else could we have?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Business sectors are formerly represented as a two dimension plan, with verticality and horizontality.
