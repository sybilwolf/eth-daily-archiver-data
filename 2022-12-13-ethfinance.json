Supply chain management: Smart contract technology can be used to track the movement of goods throughout the supply chain, increasing transparency and helping to reduce fraud and corruption. Sure, you could track the supply chain in a centralized database, but then you must have multiple corporations uploading their data to the same centralized database, and only authorized individuals have access to audit the information for accuracy.\r\n\n2.) Digital voting: Etheruem technology can be used to create secure and transparent digital voting systems, allowing for secure, anonymous voting.\n\n3.) NFTs can provide creators with a way to ensure their work is properly recognized and compensated, allowing creators to be properly compensated for their work even in secondary markets. \n\n4.) Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can help revolutionize the current broken system of insurance by providing a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for the management and operation of insurance products and services. It could be used to automate complex processes, such as underwriting, claims processing, and policy administration, thus reducing costs for both insurers and customers.\n\n5.) Identity systems such as ENS, POAP and SIWE also provide additional benefits such as improved security and increased privacy. For example, Sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE): SIWE is a decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to sign into centralized applications and websites without having to share their personal information. SIWE allows users to gain access to services without having to give away their private data to Facebook, Google, iCloud, or other centralized entities.\n\n6.) Ethereum can be used for title deeds by creating a smart contract that stores the title deed on Ethereum. The smart contract can include information such as the owner of the title deed, the associated property, and any other details about the deed. This will ensure that the title deed is securely stored and can never be tampered with or lost. Furthermore, the smart contract can be used to facilitate the transfer of a title deed from one owner to another, making the process much faster and more efficient.\n\nTo summarize, there are many applications for Ethereum technology outside of DeFi.

And many other devs who participated in BTC and ETH development are really bright too. \n\nWhat has been done by Satoshi was about money, a peer-to-peer cash system. But it's only a specific implementation about a specific use case of what has actually been discovered. What has been done is about proving a decentralized consensus. And it's just wild how far and wide it goes. But let's delve more into the reasons about it being wild.\n\nDecentralized consensus is about inventions that are rooted in conventions of interactions between individuals. All these inventions can hugely benefit from a decentralized consensus, for you can use that consensus as a very efficient support for all these inventions. \n\nFor instance, language is such an invention. You have in your mind a copy of existing words (a sort of dictionary), tokens you can assemble with others to create sentences you can send to anyone else in order to convey meaning. You need to share more or less the same dictionary as at least some other individuals in order to use language. You need to learn that dictionary. And the dictionary can't change too often or be too big. And even then, you probably won't share a completely faithful dictionary with absolutely everyone else. \n\nLikewise, money also is such an invention. And when there weren't so many individuals, people from some cultures were used to keeping in their heads who owned the tokens of highest value (which they physically represented as huge carved stones, but which were so heavy to transport they sometimes just left them wherever they were and accounted in their head who owned which stone). Obviously, using only the mind and oral tradition wasn't enough for all uses of money. Scalability was low and storage was error-prone. So, physical, externalized tokens were useful to increase scalability. But it was now prone to another error: forgery. And it lost one property, fungibility, as we could now mark physical tokens and uniquely distinguish them from each others, potentially giving a different to some tokens: collectibles. \n\nClearly, decentralized consensus allows to provide many benefits in verticality. But, as for horizontality, those were just two examples. How many more inventions can we discover and for which we will be able to use a decentralized consensus?\n\nFor instance, we're on the verge of implementing and adopting a map of proofs of wallets recognizing specific meaning of other wallets, like \"here's someone I claim is X\". Yes, identity is an invention that can benefit from decentralized consensus. There is a dictionary of individuals and, for each one of them, there's an attribution of what we call a name, a nationality, a date of birth, a surname, the name of a parent, the certificate of a school diploma, the certificate of a union with someone else, of having finished a course, having visited a place, having reach a high score in that game. And anything else. \n\nFor an institution as well as for an individual, it's wild, since it ensures the whole concept of identity as in \"what I vouch others to be\" becomes an invention just as much as money, without needing any passport (which require rare materials by design of forgery counter-measures), certificate, signature or anything alike and, most of all, without anyone being able to forge it anymore (and thus without needing any expert to recognize and prove authenticity). \n\nBut that's three inventions, so far. What other inventions could we have? I've thought about POAPs and I think we can push the concept further, with literally anyone being able to create unique names that are tied to them (or rather to their wallet) like a kind of scope providing uniqueness without requiring competition between each others for a scarce namespace. Like we could have ENS providing a scope to POAPs and as such, any ENS creating its own unique POAPs the individual can manage however they want. \n\nOr, similarly, unique hashtags.\n\nOr, more wildly, knowkedge as a whole, as a data lake of all experiments. Although, we'd probably need to take cautious steps in that regard, as an individual claiming an experiment isn't the same as an experiment having taken place. \n\nBut, what else could we have?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Repost since I didn&#39;t spot the new daily.
