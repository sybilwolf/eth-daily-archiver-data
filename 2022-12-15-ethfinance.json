I generated seeds offline on an airgapped computer using MyEtherWallet's portable seed generation website, and written the private key, in full hex form, down on a piece of paper. It was a paper wallet of the most classic sort, and a week later, it received first a <0.1 Eth test transaction, followed by the remainder of the Eth I had purchased (more than 1.1 by that point, lol.) Less than a month later, I had obtained a Ledger (donating my address at the time to the leak, as it later turned out...) and offline-signed another pair of MEW transactions (one test, and one with the rest) to move everything onto that. I slept well at night after that!\n\nThis may sound like a fairly advanced first set of steps into the crypto space, and yes, they were. I had done my research beforehand, and already fully grasped the import of self-custody, of keeping private keys **private**, of how gas worked, of the importance of test transactions, etc. etc. And one of the biggest things that I had grasped during the weeks before that first purchase? \n\n**Ethereum was where it was at.**\n\nLike everyone else, I'd started with an interest in Bitcoin, having tangentially heard about it now and then for quite a few years. But the moment I read the words \"Turing-complete blockchain\" and \"smart contract\", as a programmer I knew Ethereum was the one, selected it as my first actual purchase, and I've never looked back.\n\nThe next five years were insane, as many of you can attest to! Without repeating known history, I'll just say that I have simultaneously learned an incredible amount by being an Etherean over that amount of time, both about blockchain tech and about myself. There were certainly some major down moments (anyone who first bought in in late 2017, or heck, late 2021, will know what I mean!) but overall being a part of this space has been incredibly rewarding for me. It truly is what I imagine being a part of the dawn of the Internet, or Web, must've been like, but on steriods, since the Internet already exists this time, and as the foundation for Web3, accelerates absolutely every aspect of it.\n\nI lurked EthTrader since just about the time of that first Eth purchase, reading the daily and altcoin daily religiously for months. I'll admit I checked out a bit during the 2018-2020 bear (the fact that I joined a homesteading intentional community that required multiple hours a day of farm and homestead labor during that time may also have had something to do with it...) but all the excitement around the Beacon Chain testnets and upcoming mainnet launch, along with a price that maybe wasn't dead after all, drew me back in in autumn 2020, and I discovered that EthFinance had forked off, and clearly had absorbed the kind of folks I had always admired in EthTrader. I finally stopped lurking and started participating, and made it my home ever since. This all to say, EthTrader/EthFinance have been an integral part of my Ethereum experience since Day 1.\n\nI know I've been taking a break from posting here for the past couple of months, but as I said the last time I posted, do not take that as a sign of capitulation on my part! I'm happily working away at my Web3 job (hat tip to Influence!) and figuring some things out in my personal life, and having extra time to do so has been good. \n\nSome of you may see me in the EVMs or EthStaker Discords from time to time, and also occasionally on Twitter, and wonder, why is Interweaver posting there and not in EthFinance?\n\nThe answer is simple. This space is the very best one I've ever come across for discussing Ethereum, Web3, and decentralized tech more broadly. It has a warm, welcoming, extremely knowledgeable, at times absurdly funny community that I've found myself fitting right in with, and stimulating very thoughtful and interesting conversation pretty much any time I post anything. I enjoy every second of it, and learn a ton, and hopefully help others learn as well. \n\nBut long story short, hanging out with you guys here is hugely addictive to me. If I'm posting regularly, it inevitably turns into 2, 4, 8, 14 hours of my day doing so, and while that's fun on the one hand, it's also highly maladaptive to my life. Figuring out how to engage, in moderation, with things I am interested in is one of my projects at the moment. I would love to be able to check in for half an hour a day, make a few posts in the areas I most feel I have something to contribute, reply to a few responses, and then walk away without getting sucked in.\n\nIt's not your guys' fault - you're just super interesting and fun people to be around, more so than anywhere else (no offense EVMs or EthStakers! CT on the other hand..)\n\nAnyway, this long ramble has all been to say, it's been a long and fascinating journey these past five years, and Ethereum has been my bae since the very beginning, and EthTrader/EthFinance was and is my favorite spot on the internet to discuss it. I'm sure I'll be back for some healthier levels of posting at some point.\n\nUntil then, take care all! Enjoy what you've got here - it's truly something special :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>To within half a day, this is my fifth Etherversary.</p>\n\n<p>The very first crypto purchase I ever made was 1.1 Eth, at $703/Eth, from Coinbase, five years ago yesterday evening. </p>\n\n<p>The 1.1 was because I had already read about gas costs for sending Eth, and wanted some buffer to protect my precious whole Ether.

I&#39;ll admit I checked out a bit during the 2018-2020 bear (the fact that I joined a homesteading intentional community that required multiple hours a day of farm and homestead labor during that time may also have had something to do with it...) but all the excitement around the Beacon Chain testnets and upcoming mainnet launch, along with a price that maybe wasn&#39;t dead after all, drew me back in in autumn 2020, and I discovered that EthFinance had forked off, and clearly had absorbed the kind of folks I had always admired in EthTrader. I finally stopped lurking and started participating, and made it my home ever since. This all to say, EthTrader/EthFinance have been an integral part of my Ethereum experience since Day 1.</p>\n\n<p>I know I&#39;ve been taking a break from posting here for the past couple of months, but as I said the last time I posted, do not take that as a sign of capitulation on my part! I&#39;m happily working away at my Web3 job (hat tip to Influence!) and figuring some things out in my personal life, and having extra time to do so has been good. </p>\n\n<p>Some of you may see me in the EVMs or EthStaker Discords from time to time, and also occasionally on Twitter, and wonder, why is Interweaver posting there and not in EthFinance?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is simple. This space is the very best one I&#39;ve ever come across for discussing Ethereum, Web3, and decentralized tech more broadly. It has a warm, welcoming, extremely knowledgeable, at times absurdly funny community that I&#39;ve found myself fitting right in with, and stimulating very thoughtful and interesting conversation pretty much any time I post anything. I enjoy every second of it, and learn a ton, and hopefully help others learn as well. </p>\n\n<p>But long story short, hanging out with you guys here is hugely addictive to me. If I&#39;m posting regularly, it inevitably turns into 2, 4, 8, 14 hours of my day doing so, and while that&#39;s fun on the one hand, it&#39;s also highly maladaptive to my life. Figuring out how to engage, in moderation, with things I am interested in is one of my projects at the moment. I would love to be able to check in for half an hour a day, make a few posts in the areas I most feel I have something to contribute, reply to a few responses, and then walk away without getting sucked in.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not your guys&#39; fault - you&#39;re just super interesting and fun people to be around, more so than anywhere else (no offense EVMs or EthStakers! CT on the other hand..)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this long ramble has all been to say, it&#39;s been a long and fascinating journey these past five years, and Ethereum has been my bae since the very beginning, and EthTrader/EthFinance was and is my favorite spot on the internet to discuss it. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back for some healthier levels of posting at some point.</p>\n\n<p>Until then, take care all! Enjoy what you&#39;ve got here - it&#39;s truly something special :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-15 04:37:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j0bdobm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zmdpjz","parent_id":"t3_zmdpjz","score":79,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Kukai_walker","body":"As I began following this sub a couple of years ago, you were the first poster that caught my attention as combining clarity, helpfulness, and knowledge.
