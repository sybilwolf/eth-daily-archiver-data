It turns out that it's currently about **1/3** of the fees it generates on its own Polygon PoS network. Not as much, but also not insignificant (unless you compare to the $70M total ETH fees generated last month). I suspect back when gas fees were 10x higher, MATIC generated more fees on the Ethereum network than on the Polygon PoS network.\n\nKeep in mind that these only include **direct** revenue fees.

I had a look through their whitepaper (which, as is the norm these days, was more high level and full of marketing than I'd like from a whitepaper, but oh well).\n\n**Intro**\n\nDeso is a L1 blockchain specialized to act as a social media application. They believe it is important to have almost all social media data on-chain, from profiles to posts to encrypted DMs to likes. Their main tool in keeping this chain running smoothly is that it is *not* a general-purpose chain. It does not have a VM; all operations are implemented directly on the underlying hardware.\n\nTheir social media platform is hyper-financialized, where every profile has their own token. \"Liking\" a post involves buying a very small amount of the profile's token, which may give commenting rights on their posts (or other exclusive rights), and may give returns via speculation and a small cut from NFTs the profile mints. This activity is all managed and stored on-chain.\n\n**Chain Details**\n\nDeso is a \"hybrid\" PoW chain that claims to use much less electricity than Bitcoin or (pre-merge?) Ethereum. At the time of writing, they planned to move to PoS by the end of 2022. I did not further look up if or how this transition is going.\n\nDeso currently produces 2 MB blocks every 5 minutes, for a total post throughout of about 10 posts/s. Their scaling roadmap calls for bigger blocks and faster sync times, eventually enabling 120 MB blocks, or about 238 GB of block space per week. They estimate that this level of throughput can be validated (just barely) by one high-end workstation/server CPU.\n\nThey describe plans to implement sharding, but my impression is that they see it as a magical tool that solves all scaling problems. Just put everything on a separate shard, and now it's infinitely parallelizable! Scaling solved!\n\n**Node Operation**\n\nAnd finally, running a Deso node isn't just about being able to mine on the chain or contribute to decentralization. Deso nodes act as frontends for users. Node operators have access to all Deso transaction data and can host a web server to provide that info for common users.\n\nNotably, node operators are responsible for creating their own version of the social media platform. They don't have to provide *all* posts to their users. They can brand themselves as a (e.g.) moderation-heavy platform for gamers and streamers, filtering out everything else. Or they could be focused on music, politics, whatever; with whatever forms of moderation or filtering they like. In the end it all comes down to the same data source on the same blockchain, so if users don't like that node/app/frontend they can get the same data elsewhere.\n\nAnd that's the gist of it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m always curious about how different L1 chains operate, especially when they make grand claims about transaction prices.
