I work for a midsized organization with revenues in the Billions.\n\nAfter following this community for a while (and having a background in software development) I decided to take the advice I've read here many times about the bear: if you want to build your conviction, build. So I did just that.\n\nI did a brief Solidity tutorial a couple months back, and the stark reality of how real Ethereum is slapped me in the face in that moment. Of course, I had used Ethereum for a few use cases myself, but it became immediately clear to me that if you can dream it, it can be built. So I did just that.\n\nI began building a proof of concept to replicate a core part of the business where I work. In less than 3 weeks of part-time effort (i.e., my evenings), I had replicated the core mechanics of our business on Ethereum via smart contracts! It was incredible to me the speed in which I was able to implement this.\n\nNot only was I able to replicate the base functionality, I was able to implement new functionality to us, such as immediate and direct payment to our customers and partners via sending Ether. Just for that disbursement functionality alone, we have a very expensive ERP system to do this currently.\n\nI also created an ERC20 token to act as loyalty points that are airdropped for certain activities, in real-time. That piece only took 2 hours to implement.\n\nI then took the next 3 weeks (again, in my evenings) to build out the UI in React to replicate our UI with an equally user-friendly interface. At this point, my conviction has never been higher, and I needed to get this information out in my organization. Last year I had previously done a blockchain presentation to our senior leaders, but it was high level and more abstract. This was real. This was tangible.\n\nA short time later, an opportunity arose for me to mention this demo in my workplace. Fast forward, I ended up demoing this to our executive team, including discussing many different use cases for this technology related to our business. This has now opened up the door for our organization to investigate pursuing the blockchain in a more serious manner.\n\nIn fact, we are now working to arrange a session in the new year with EY and our very own /u/pbrody!\n\nFor my use case, we absolutely need L2 solutions in place, they can't come fast enough. We need thousands of transactions per second to handle our peak load. I've said it before, but L2's are the key to blowing open innovation in this space.\n\nWill we implement what I built exactly as I built it? I highly doubt it, but I've shown the capabilities and possibilities, and I don't doubt there is a future where we move into this space in some capacity.\n\nI hope this gives you a little confidence that the ecosystem is indeed moving forward and magic is happening in the dark, quiet time of the bear.\n\nTake care, ethfam.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey ethfam, if you are feeling blue about the bear, prices, or adoption, please read this, it will hopefully give you a little injection of hope in these times.</p>\n\n<p>At the likely risk of doxxing myself to some of my coworkers, I&#39;m going to share what I have been doing during the bear with the company I work for.</p>\n\n<p>As background, I&#39;m in a senior leadership role within IT, focused on IT direction/strategy and software development.

Problem is that the gain is in Tax Year 2022 and the loss if I sold now would be in Tax Year 2023 i.e. they don\u2019t negate each other. &#39;Negligible value claims&#39; seem to be a way of dealing with this kind of shit in the UK but tbh can\u2019t find any examples in crypto. Going to pay for an accountant but really interested to hear if anyone\u2019s actually done this before.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The effect of this would be to treat the alt \u2018as if it was sold\u2019 in the earlier tax year, e.g. retroactive tax loss harvesting for investments which have a near 0 chance of ever recovering. Would reduce my overall gains for the year by nearly \u00a3200k and hence my tax bill by a few thousand.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-23 18:25:01","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-12-23 19:24:52","id":"j1g7h10","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zt7wxy","parent_id":"t3_zt7wxy","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/not-ngmi","body":"In the US, I think you would be able to file an amended return for 2021 to offset the gain with losses from 2022. \n\nI don\u2019t know how the UK works, but it\u2019s complicated enough that it\u2019s probably worth paying someone to do it for you","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In the US, I think you would be able to file an amended return for 2021 to offset the gain with losses from 2022. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know how the UK works, but it\u2019s complicated enough that it\u2019s probably worth paying someone to do it for you</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-23 18:49:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j1gacqo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zt7wxy","parent_id":"t1_j1g7h10","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/theFoot58","body":"No, in the USA he would have fallen into the classic tax trap,  \u201cyou made a gain last year,  we don\u2019t care that you don\u2019t have the assets to pay your taxes due this year\u201d\n\nI had a friend massacred for 200k USD due to this simple oops! in the Internet bubble.\n\nHoping UK is different","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>No, in the USA he would have fallen into the classic tax trap,  \u201cyou made a gain last year,  we don\u2019t care that you don\u2019t have the assets to pay your taxes due this year\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I had a friend massacred for 200k USD due to this simple oops! in the Internet bubble.</p>\n\n<p>Hoping UK is different</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-23 19:10:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j1gcvbz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zt7wxy","parent_id":"t1_j1gacqo","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/diego-d","body":"I've used an accountant for the past 4 years but they were shit.
