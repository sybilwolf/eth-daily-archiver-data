EOF will continue to ship throughout the next few hard forks, but that's not something that gets a lot of hype from regular users. 4844 may very well be the last big core protocol thing that gets people excited, and then all the hype moves to layer 2 as rollups use blobspace in innovative ways to do crazy cool stuff. I'm looking at the roadmap and a lot of the stuff that will come next is basically \"oh cool it's like that thing we already have, but a bit better\", or it's too gradual to get anywhere near the hype that the merge did.

I was hoping that the expert would in-still a new bullishness for nuclear in me but it was actually very disappointing.</p>\n\n<p>He did a good job of dispelling some of the perceived yet illogical objections to nuclear energy (e.g., why Fukishima happened), but really failed to put across the benefits of it (especially new age reactors) and did nothing to provide contemporary comparisons to other green energy technologies. I know we need a mix of energy generation and nuclear is likely best for baseload, but there\u2019s still so many huge and expensive barriers to building new nuclear in the West that (in my lay understanding) renewable generation, storage, and distribution seems much more appealing especially with newer adjacent dense storage capabilities like hydrogen. </p>\n\n<p>The issues he points out with nuclear are: lack of expertise in design &amp; construction, lack of regulatory clarity on new reactors, no regulatory work on new fuels (e.g., thorium), long &amp; complex planning processes, enormous &amp; unpredictable build costs, decades long build times, lack of expertise in maintenance &amp; development, SMR marketing fads, waste storage &amp; processing costs, huge decommissioning costs. He mostly laughs off fusion. </p>\n\n<p>The west is doing very well with renewable generation, here in the UK we regularly produce more than 50% of our needs from wind alone. Many of the above issues with nuclear don\u2019t apply or are quite well mitigated. In sum, although nuclear has a low ongoing fuel input cost, everything else is expensive, slow, and complex. That\u2019s not about to change anytime soon and I guess I\u2019m just disappointed that even an enthusiastic industry expert cannot sell nuclear to someone who wants to see more of it. </p>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts on our green energy future and your outlook on nuclear?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-24 01:27:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j1h9lab","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zu3882","parent_id":"t3_zu3882","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/0xDepositContract","body":"Good points, and I don't have much to add, except on this bit:\n\n> even an enthusiastic industry expert cannot sell nuclear\n\nIndustry experts usually have in-depth technical knowledge and are realistic with all pros and cons, and therefore not a good fit for selling the idea.
