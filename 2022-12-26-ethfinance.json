All these proof-of-stake coins are printed from thin air and thus worth nothing\"\n\nThere is *some* truth to the first part, Bitcoin-the-blockchain's security does rely on energy and hardware being effectively burned such that if you wanna mess with it, you have to burn a lot of energy and hardware yourself, and if you got that kind of money it'll probably be more cost-effective to play by the rules and contribute to the security of the network.\n\nWhat they get wrong is that Bitcoin-the-asset *is* printed out of thin air - the protocol is just set in such a way that the person assigned to get the newly printed-out-of-thin-air coins is randomly selected from the pool of people currently burning energy and hardware, weighted by how much they're burning relative to the rest of the network.\n\nThe idea behind proof of stake is realizing that this whole \"energy and hardware\" bit is just a proxy for how much capital is involved in network security, the whole \"skin in the game\" bit. We don't *have* to have all this energy and hardware wasted to represent the capital at stake, we can just... take the capital, and stake it. And it just so happens that blockchains have a perfectly apt representation of capital: [their native coin itself](https://i.imgur.com/cOF3vUV.png). \n\nIronically this whole notion of \"Bitcoin is backed by external rules of physics\" is not a reason why it's more secure, it's a reason why it's more fragile: The protocol can't punish bad actors, since their capital has the form of external hardware and energy being continuously burned. You want that shit internalized. (Asset scarcity and energy scarcity likewise have nothing in common; digital scarcity is all social consensus).

All these proof-of-stake coins are printed from thin air and thus worth nothing&quot;</p>\n\n<p>There is <em>some</em> truth to the first part, Bitcoin-the-blockchain&#39;s security does rely on energy and hardware being effectively burned such that if you wanna mess with it, you have to burn a lot of energy and hardware yourself, and if you got that kind of money it&#39;ll probably be more cost-effective to play by the rules and contribute to the security of the network.</p>\n\n<p>What they get wrong is that Bitcoin-the-asset <em>is</em> printed out of thin air - the protocol is just set in such a way that the person assigned to get the newly printed-out-of-thin-air coins is randomly selected from the pool of people currently burning energy and hardware, weighted by how much they&#39;re burning relative to the rest of the network.</p>\n\n<p>The idea behind proof of stake is realizing that this whole &quot;energy and hardware&quot; bit is just a proxy for how much capital is involved in network security, the whole &quot;skin in the game&quot; bit. We don&#39;t <em>have</em> to have all this energy and hardware wasted to represent the capital at stake, we can just... take the capital, and stake it. And it just so happens that blockchains have a perfectly apt representation of capital: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/cOF3vUV.png\">their native coin itself</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Ironically this whole notion of &quot;Bitcoin is backed by external rules of physics&quot; is not a reason why it&#39;s more secure, it&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s more fragile: The protocol can&#39;t punish bad actors, since their capital has the form of external hardware and energy being continuously burned.

Some of my thoughts on this:\n\nRough calculation: say we have peak daily fees of $50 mil per day (right now it is around $2 mil per day). This was the rough peak we had last year during the peak of the bull run. Next time around, I really doubt we can go past that as L2s would have soaked up more blockspace demand. That's annual revenue of $18 billion. If we value the network using a P/E ratio of 10, thats a max value of  $180 billion (thats a peak ETH price of like $1600, even in the most optimistic scenario!)\n\nAnd that is where monetary premium comes in. First, what exactly does monetary premium mean? Anna Rose kept grilling Drake about this too. My shot at explaning monetary premium would be: the premium or multiple a money-like asset is valued at, over its basic quantifiable utility driven valuation, because of its culturally or memetically desirable properties. So while the utility driven valuation is objective and quantitative, looking at cash flows and revenue etc, the monetary premium multiple is subjective, driven by memes and cultural norms. Perhaps the only example we have is gold, where Drake says the overall valuation for gold based on its (non cultural) utility for making electronics parts in devices and cabling is about 10% of the total gold market cap. The 10x multiple gold enjoys is because of its monetary premium, because it has been historically seen as a desirable money-like asset to hold on to. \n\nAnd with that, we can derive some of the basic properties needed to enjoy a monetary premium: firstly the asset should be scarce/have low emission (gold, btc and eth fill this criteria well). Secondly, intrinsic demand to bootstrap demand for the money-like asset (gold has some intrinsic use, btc has almost no intrinsic use outside of very limited LN adoption, and ETH has a LOT of use in the on-chain ecosystem as pristine collateral, gas fees, NFT price denominator etc). Thirdly, a strong series of cultural norms and stories that sustains a high monetary premium for the asset. This is where ETH fares the poorest. Gold has a cultural meme that goes back 4000 years. BTC has a pretty strong \"digital gold\" meme that is easy to explain and understand. ETH is rarely promoted as digital gold. Vitalik wrote a whole blog post about what excites him the most about the ethereum ecosystem recently, and the words ETH as non-sovereign money, ETH as pristine collateral or the phrase \"monetary premium\" didn't even appear once.     \n\nSo, ETH has 2 of the 3 properties needed to enjoy a good monetary premium. What happens if this narrative fails to take hold? Well, we would expect the eth network to be valued at its intrinsic value ($180 bil), which means the ecosystem built on top of it can be no bigger than $150 billionish. Settlement layer of the internet, let alone the world? No chance. The security budget of the network is not enough, because it failed to acquire a monetary premium. \n\nWhat happens if we succeed as much as gold, and acquire a 10x monetary premium? That puts a max market cap of $1.8 trillion. Which means the eth ecosystem can confortably secure a trillion dollar economy on-top of it. Maybe it can't secure all the worlds derivatives and equities, but it sure seems sufficient to be the settlement layer of the internet at least. \n\n/u/liberosist recently argued that blockspace is no longer limiting, and legitimate crypto usecases are what is limiting. I would argue for a new \"adoption trilema\", where you have 3 pain points, each of which need to be solved to have mainstream adoption. Cheap blockspace via scaling solutions, legit crypto usescases via the application layer solutions, and the *ethereum base layer being able to secure a trillion dollar economy via acquiring a high monetary premium*. If any of these 3 fail, the promise of ethereum is stunted. \n\nAnd this is where I perhaps end on a not-so optimistic note. I think the ethereum community is good at coordinating solutions to technical problems (improving client diversity, LSD diversity, relayer diversity, pushing for home staking etc), but not so much for co-ordinating cultural memes. Because it is a tech heavy community that may seem cultural stories as not important intangibles.

A bit more concerned by scaling blockspace too fast. Much more concerned by not being able to attract use cases that can generate demand for blockspace.\n\nFirst, an observation you are all pretty familiar with. Net issuance after the merge is pretty much 0% +/- 0.01%. And the price is ridiculously stable too after the drops, as if fixated by a magnet to 1200ish. These two things are not a coincidence, Ethereum's monetary policy has a stable equilibrium at 0% net issuance. This equilibrium is what ties network revenues and ETH price together. For given network revenues in USD, there is a price of ETH at which inflation is 0. Above it, inflation is positive and below it inflation is negative. This price at which inflation is 0 is trivial to calculate:\n\nMonetary price [USD/ETH] = Base Fees Paid [USD] / Issuance [ETH]\n\nUnsurprisingly, if you plug the issuance and the network revenues paid as base fees since the merge you get the 1200ish range we are in. That is, given network usage in USD there is a natural price of ETH to which we tend to go back which is the price at which inflation is 0.\n\nWhy? Well... It's the price at which all ETH burnt is issued. Which is the only stable solution if there is no net inflows or outflows (net buying pressure/net selling pressure). In the past I called it the monetary price, I think it's rather fitting because it's the only price that can be derived without any external assumptions except ETH issuance and network use.\n\nThat it's a stable equilibrium is rather easy to see. Bump the price up, and you enter inflationary territory so there is ETH printing that needs to be absorbed by buyers or the price falls. Bump it down, and you enter deflationary territory so there is net ETH destruction, which requires over extended periods net sellers to sustain or the asset becomes too scarce and starts rising in price.\n\nInterestingly, there is another equilibrium. Yield. Staked ETH is a productive asset and gives yield. Investors are hungry for yield and all assets tend to stabilize in certain yield given their risk characteristics. Or, conversely, investors demand some yield premium with respect to the risk free rate based on the risk of the asset. This equilibrium is reached by number of stakers which is a free floating market discovered number, yield becomes too low validators unstake, yield becomes too high validators pile in. So for given network revenues, there is a price equilibrium at 0 inflation. And for given risk premium, there is a stable equilibrium (once unstaking is possible) for yield and number of validators. \n\nSo with all this laid out. To acquire monetary premium means to have positive inflation. And viceversa, if inflation is positive there is monetary premium. That's you bump the asset price beyond it's natural equilibrium that is justified due to its use. Same way gold's price is not due to its industrial use but because it's acquired as a store of value. Right now, all ETH price can be explained due to its use as evidenced by the fact that we are at 0% inflation and right on the monetary price. \n\nWhy I'm not too concerned with monetary premium? Mostly because it will come, just takes time. If you notice, behind the monetary price and 0% inflation there is the assumption that there are no net inflows or outflows. Which is a fair and conservative assumption. But... over the long-term the numerator is getting deflated (USD are getting printed over the long-term) at a rate of roughly 2%. So any asset that inflates at a slower rate is pretty much guaranteed to acquire monetary premium because there is net inflows, by the simple reason that there is more of them. ETH inflation is currently capped at 0.5%, so it's significantly harder money than fiat, which means it will acquire monetary premium. But this means ETH will go into the inflationary regime! Hence why I have been trying to fight the meme of deflationary money, it's not guaranteed to occur and it shouldn't be seen as an objective. On the contrary, the long-term sign of success is that we have acquired monetary premium and live in the inflationary regime. Monetary premium == Inflationary ETH.\n\nWhy I'm a bit more concerned with scaling blockspace too fast? Because it can destroy the revenues that ensure our current valuations and this can have an effect on our levels of security. You want to unleash blockspace supply at a rate that closely follows demand, too fast and you destroy the valuation until induced demand kicks-in. Too late and new use cases cannot come to fruition. So you want to be close that line where a fee market develops but it doesn't push out any use case that wants to use Ethereum out.\n\nTo explore all this in excruciating level of detail check here the spreadsheet in the following post, download it and play around with it.
