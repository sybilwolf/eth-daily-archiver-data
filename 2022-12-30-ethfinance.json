The secure custody of assets is important and I appreciate the service.

Are you suggesting that dApp builders in Ethereum don\u2019t understand those things? This is a ridiculous reason to buy your SOL bags.\n\n>\t8/ That said, because @solana's ecosystem is not solely crypto diehards, it's rockier in a bear as some of the Web2 folks lose their nerve. But in terms of building easy-to-use products, & delivering those products to the masses, I\u2019m inspired by what I see from Solana teams.\n\nSo they\u2019re committed and dedicated to developing a cryptocurrency but they aren\u2019t all die hard crypto enthusiasts so they dump this pile of shit as soon as the economy sours and the money dries up? Good thing they aren\u2019t \u201cdiehards\u201d or Solana might have more exit liquidity for your heavy ass bags. *So Inspiring!*\n\n>\t9/ @Solana-based teams that @placeholdervc works directly with include @vaultapp_(former founders of @FanDuel), @orca_so(team has Ethereum roots), @solendprotocol(team also has Ethereum roots), and @buildwithnation.\n\nOh cool. You have\u2026 4 solid projects building on SOL. Two are from Ethereum originally tho\u2026 so what about #3 up there? Is it really *unique* when half here are current or former ETH developers too?\n\n>\t10/ All of these teams are ideals driven, working to build a product that their communities love, and as showcased by \n@clockwrrk's post, they are all working towards an ethical @solana ecosystem:\n\nThank god someone over there is finally working on ethics\u2026 because ethically Solana looks like a bag of horse shit on fire to me!\n\n>\t11/ And as an example, @orca_so reserved less for insiders than most bluechip #Ethereum #DeFi teams. Many @solana teams have NOT gone for the Alameda high-FDV scam launch, and thankfully the ecosystem is rooting out any further of that behavior:\n\nSee! Soooo ethical! Thank god for altruism and *ethics* like this!\n\n>\t12/ In terms of the tech itself, the SVM is novel & performant and I see it becoming a dev standard w/ projects like @Nitro_Labs & @EclipseFND, to name a few. The SVM can spread more quickly than the EVM did bc the modular stack makes it easier to roll out on diff DA layers.\n\nGo ahead and list the other projects too. Don\u2019t act like there are too many to list. SVM? Lemme guess\u2026 Solana Virtual Machine? So unique! It spreads faster? What does that mean? How does security and distribution compare? Who are Solana\u2019s masters?\n\n>\t13/ Meanwhile, @aeyakovenko & the core engineers are maniacally focused on ironing out the Solana network's kinks, making progress on fees, reliability, speed, and decentralization.\n\nSo you aren\u2019t unique really. Just doing the same thing Ethereum is, but backwards. They focused on speed and cost at the expense of reliability and decentralization which is why no one wants it. I don\u2019t care how fast a rocket is if it doesn\u2019t have redundant safety systems to keep me safe during the journey.\n\n>\t14/ It\u2019s meaningful to me that with Firedancer from @jump_, Solana will be the only network with two node implementations other than Ethereum (correct me if I\u2019m wrong!):\n\nSo unique\u2026.\n\n>\t15/ While it has competitors, I anticipate @solana will be *the* blockchain ecosystem known for consensus near the speed of light -- in part because it is the OG to pursue this vision -- and that will attract builders that prioritize speed w/ sufficient decentralization.\n\nGod I hope y\u2019all get that last part nailed down soon. It\u2019s sorta important for this whole thing to work right. Me personally, I would have built my racecar around my engine, but you do you boo.\n\n>\t15/ @rajgokal and his team remain focused on how to serve the broader set of Solana builders, while not having Labs or the Foundation crowd out innovation, and more broadly I'm seeing amazing comradery & conversation amongst the core builders.\n\nAwesome. Usually teams do need to work together. Glad they figured that out.\n\n>\t16/ Not nearly as many committed teams are leaving @solana as the screaming masses on cryptowitter would make it seem. Instead, they're doubling down and discussing + working together to make the Solana ecosystem better.\n\nStrangely neither you or *the screaming masses* have any actual numbers here tho.\n\n>\t17/ Furthermore, many dapps were homegrown on @solana, because everything about building on the network is quite different from building for the #EVM. And so what's built on Solana is stickier than most people realize, imo.\n\nSo sticky that \u201cnot as many\u201d are leaving. That\u2019s super sticky.\n\n>\t19/ Stepping back for a moment, I understand why some long-time committed crypto-folks are taking this opportunity to step on @solana's neck. Some of them view Solana as betraying crypto's ideals. Or... they feel threatened.\n\nTrust me when I say it\u2019s not because I feel threatened. It is 100% the first reason.\n\n>\t19/ To them, I'd say that having watched the birth of Ethereum and every chain after it, if you're close enough to the inside you know every ecosystem has warts around its founding. Every ecosystem lives in a glass house, because we're all human, and humans make mistakes.\n\nYeah\u2026 it\u2019s just that Solana's mistakes are stupid ones that team ETH over here saw a million miles away. They aren\u2019t innovating new mistakes, you\u2019re repeating really really old ones.\n\n>\t20/ The key for me is are you earnestly working to make things better? To learn from your mistakes? To relentlessly improve yourself, and the world? If you are, I'm all for you, and I see much of that in the @solana ecosystem.\n\nSo true. You should listen to yourself and dump your SOL bags now and join the team that is doing everything you\u2019ve said instead of the one trying *really hard* to do it but still failing over and over.\n\n>\t21/ But punching down on @solana with overgeneralizations, I find gross. Especially seeing it come from Ethereum folks who unfairly endured the way Bitcoin Maxis punched down on us in 2018 & 2019. Have you learned nothing?\n\nWe punch down when we see bullshit. Come at us with something valuable if you want us to punch you up.\n\n>\t22/ Current punching-down sentiment around $SOL reminds me of $ETH in late 2018, when $BTC maxis were jeering that its trajectory was to $0. We all know how that played out... it only motivated Ethereum more. Just as Solana folks are only getting further motivation currently...\n\nYou should investigate why it played out like that for Ethereum and then determine if Solana should be expected to play out exactly the same.\n\n>\t23/ While @placeholdervc has been a long-time supporter of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we have chosen to support Cosmos and Solana with similar levels of conviction beginning in 2022 because we believe they offer unique, but valuable innovation ecosystems to the mix\n\nWait!?

You have\u2026 4 solid projects building on SOL. Two are from Ethereum originally tho\u2026 so what about #3 up there? Is it really <em>unique</em> when half here are current or former ETH developers too?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>10/ All of these teams are ideals driven, working to build a product that their communities love, and as showcased by \n@clockwrrk&#39;s post, they are all working towards an ethical @solana ecosystem:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thank god someone over there is finally working on ethics\u2026 because ethically Solana looks like a bag of horse shit on fire to me!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>11/ And as an example, @orca_so reserved less for insiders than most bluechip #Ethereum #DeFi teams. Many @solana teams have NOT gone for the Alameda high-FDV scam launch, and thankfully the ecosystem is rooting out any further of that behavior:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See! Soooo ethical! Thank god for altruism and <em>ethics</em> like this!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>12/ In terms of the tech itself, the SVM is novel &amp; performant and I see it becoming a dev standard w/ projects like @Nitro_Labs &amp; @EclipseFND, to name a few. The SVM can spread more quickly than the EVM did bc the modular stack makes it easier to roll out on diff DA layers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Go ahead and list the other projects too. Don\u2019t act like there are too many to list. SVM? Lemme guess\u2026 Solana Virtual Machine? So unique! It spreads faster? What does that mean? How does security and distribution compare? Who are Solana\u2019s masters?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>13/ Meanwhile, @aeyakovenko &amp; the core engineers are maniacally focused on ironing out the Solana network&#39;s kinks, making progress on fees, reliability, speed, and decentralization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So you aren\u2019t unique really. Just doing the same thing Ethereum is, but backwards. They focused on speed and cost at the expense of reliability and decentralization which is why no one wants it. I don\u2019t care how fast a rocket is if it doesn\u2019t have redundant safety systems to keep me safe during the journey.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>14/ It\u2019s meaningful to me that with Firedancer from @jump_, Solana will be the only network with two node implementations other than Ethereum (correct me if I\u2019m wrong!):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So unique\u2026.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>15/ While it has competitors, I anticipate @solana will be <em>the</em> blockchain ecosystem known for consensus near the speed of light -- in part because it is the OG to pursue this vision -- and that will attract builders that prioritize speed w/ sufficient decentralization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God I hope y\u2019all get that last part nailed down soon. It\u2019s sorta important for this whole thing to work right. Me personally, I would have built my racecar around my engine, but you do you boo.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>15/ @rajgokal and his team remain focused on how to serve the broader set of Solana builders, while not having Labs or the Foundation crowd out innovation, and more broadly I&#39;m seeing amazing comradery &amp; conversation amongst the core builders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Awesome. Usually teams do need to work together. Glad they figured that out.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>16/ Not nearly as many committed teams are leaving @solana as the screaming masses on cryptowitter would make it seem. Instead, they&#39;re doubling down and discussing + working together to make the Solana ecosystem better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Strangely neither you or <em>the screaming masses</em> have any actual numbers here tho.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>17/ Furthermore, many dapps were homegrown on @solana, because everything about building on the network is quite different from building for the #EVM. And so what&#39;s built on Solana is stickier than most people realize, imo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So sticky that \u201cnot as many\u201d are leaving. That\u2019s super sticky.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>19/ Stepping back for a moment, I understand why some long-time committed crypto-folks are taking this opportunity to step on @solana&#39;s neck. Some of them view Solana as betraying crypto&#39;s ideals. Or... they feel threatened.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trust me when I say it\u2019s not because I feel threatened. It is 100% the first reason.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>19/ To them, I&#39;d say that having watched the birth of Ethereum and every chain after it, if you&#39;re close enough to the inside you know every ecosystem has warts around its founding. Every ecosystem lives in a glass house, because we&#39;re all human, and humans make mistakes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah\u2026 it\u2019s just that Solana&#39;s mistakes are stupid ones that team ETH over here saw a million miles away. They aren\u2019t innovating new mistakes, you\u2019re repeating really really old ones.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>20/ The key for me is are you earnestly working to make things better? To learn from your mistakes? To relentlessly improve yourself, and the world? If you are, I&#39;m all for you, and I see much of that in the @solana ecosystem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So true. You should listen to yourself and dump your SOL bags now and join the team that is doing everything you\u2019ve said instead of the one trying <em>really hard</em> to do it but still failing over and over.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>21/ But punching down on @solana with overgeneralizations, I find gross. Especially seeing it come from Ethereum folks who unfairly endured the way Bitcoin Maxis punched down on us in 2018 &amp; 2019. Have you learned nothing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We punch down when we see bullshit. Come at us with something valuable if you want us to punch you up.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>22/ Current punching-down sentiment around $SOL reminds me of $ETH in late 2018, when $BTC maxis were jeering that its trajectory was to $0. We all know how that played out... it only motivated Ethereum more. Just as Solana folks are only getting further motivation currently...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should investigate why it played out like that for Ethereum and then determine if Solana should be expected to play out exactly the same.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>23/ While @placeholdervc has been a long-time supporter of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we have chosen to support Cosmos and Solana with similar levels of conviction beginning in 2022 because we believe they offer unique, but valuable innovation ecosystems to the mix</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wait!? VC\u2019s are committed to Solana!? Well shit fuck on fire man! Where do I sign up!? Psych! Good luck with your bags homie!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-30 07:48:57","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-12-30 08:32:56","id":"j297qge","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zyspvz","parent_id":"t1_j2823xx","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Smegma_Farmer","body":"Someone call an ambulance ....
