I can give you a brief (and totally unsourced) overview of my thoughts tho.\n\nDisclaimer: I am very long on DOT and the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nFirst, regarding inflation: if you stake (and you should, since there is 1-click trustless liquid delegated staking), you beat inflation by double. I think inflation is ~7%, and staking rewards are ~15%, and up to 20% with some liquid staking/LP strategies. Basically it is trivially easy to beat inflation and get a ~7% real return, so not losing sleep over it.\n\nPolkadot isn't Ethereum. It's hilarious seeing people posting charts of fee revenue to dunk on Polkadot and call it a ghost chain, because Polkadot doesn't rely on fees. There are currently two main drivers for demand - staking (targeting a roughly 50% supply staked ratio through a variable staking reward rate, less stakers = higher rewards as incentive), and securing parachain slots. \n\nParachain slots are issued by auction, with the project that is able to lock up the most DOT during an auction period winning the slot. They can put up their own DOT, or they can do a crowd loan where they offer their native token in return for other people locking up on their behalf. This DOT is locked for 2 years (and can't collect staking rewards, so the cost is that opportunity), and after 2 years everyone's DOT is unlocked and returned to them. Once a parachain gets their slot they get something like 1k TPS and the fulls security of the Polkadot relay chain (as well as unlimited interchain messaging) for that 2 year period, with no further costs. \n\nCurrently parachains have been relying on crowdloans to get their slots, but as time goes on most of them will utilize their value accrual mechanisms to begin to build up DOT treasuries to ensure they can be self sustaining and win auctions with their own funds moving forward.

It is incredibly helpful for wrapping your head around Polkadot's value proposition.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Nothing that immediately comes to mind, you definitely have to poke around and suss out the long term vision for yourself with Polkadot. I can give you a brief (and totally unsourced) overview of my thoughts tho.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I am very long on DOT and the Polkadot ecosystem</p>\n\n<p>First, regarding inflation: if you stake (and you should, since there is 1-click trustless liquid delegated staking), you beat inflation by double. I think inflation is ~7%, and staking rewards are ~15%, and up to 20% with some liquid staking/LP strategies. Basically it is trivially easy to beat inflation and get a ~7% real return, so not losing sleep over it.</p>\n\n<p>Polkadot isn&#39;t Ethereum. It&#39;s hilarious seeing people posting charts of fee revenue to dunk on Polkadot and call it a ghost chain, because Polkadot doesn&#39;t rely on fees. There are currently two main drivers for demand - staking (targeting a roughly 50% supply staked ratio through a variable staking reward rate, less stakers = higher rewards as incentive), and securing parachain slots. </p>\n\n<p>Parachain slots are issued by auction, with the project that is able to lock up the most DOT during an auction period winning the slot. They can put up their own DOT, or they can do a crowd loan where they offer their native token in return for other people locking up on their behalf. This DOT is locked for 2 years (and can&#39;t collect staking rewards, so the cost is that opportunity), and after 2 years everyone&#39;s DOT is unlocked and returned to them.
