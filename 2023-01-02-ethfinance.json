Analyzing Frame is on my plate, but it is a bit of a different beast being a desktop application that connects to the browser extension. \n\nI have always been a Firefox and Metamask user, and wanted to know more about how it works.\n\nI followed the same steps as before to download and analyze the extension, which can be found at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn\n\nhttps://imgur.com/JJRPty5\n\nWhen installed, MetaMask immediately contacts Ankr's API, obtaining chain information very similarly to Tally Ho.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a7yjGIE\n\nAgain, a request to the Avalanche network that is almost identical to the one sent by Tally Ho.\n\nWe have on our hands yet another wallet that uses sentry.io to track you, as can be seen below.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/IXtg5ZN\n\nAs usual, you can verify that this request was generated by MetaMask by viewing the 'Origin:' request header.\n\nAnd yall already knew that MetaMask uses infura for all sorts of functions, below showing one of many requests.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/5hmC6Pk\n\nMetaMask grabs a few phishing domain lists.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/sPkEw13\n\nmin-api.cryptocompare.com is used as a price feed for ETH\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BWFpW02\n\nThis domain must handle a ton of requests.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/cIDfSBk\n\nAbove is the first request to youtube generated by MetaMask. It loads https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVgfHZMFFFQ 'What is MetaMask?' as an intro to MetaMask video.\n\nNotice the cookie and its value in the request? That was sent before youtube.com had a chance to set the cookie. Meaning that it is hardcoded, or generated on the fly by MetaMask itself.\n\nI did not bother to reinstall MetaMask to test this, its just extremely odd behavior.\n\nLook towards the bottom of the response section to see youtube setting a new cookie.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/rjGZhbh\n\nThe next request to youtube shows that MetaMask did not even make use of the newly set cookie sent by youtube. Again, youtube attempts to set a fresh cookie. \n\nAnd because MetaMask is willing to silently load every piece of javascript youtube has to offer, we again meet our friend https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleclick.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/uikkstC\n\nThere are quite a few requests to doubleclick. In fairness to MetaMask, I could not find anything that leads me to believe that they are using it to track you. This is youtube's tracking at work.\n\nThough, for context as to why I still find this so offensive I must link my personal cybersecurity blogpost pertaining to javascript https://fistfulofsecurity.blogspot.com/2021/06/detecting-cve-2018-16938-noscript-bypass.html\n\nIf you wish to see some examples of what offensive and defensive security look like, check out my other posts there. Still all very basic stuff.\n\nAt this point I wasnt super happy, and switched over to my actual MetaMask installation.\n\nNow I am not using burpsuite, but instead wireshark. I do not have the ability to view encrypted traffic in this environment. And as the following may contain my personal info, I will not be posting screenshots.\n\nOn a separate note, I would like to clear up a misconception that many have about how TLS works.\n\nTLS obviously encrypts the data sent between the client and the server. Most people know that TLS does not hide the ip address you connect to. However, many people do not know that the *domain name* you are visiting cannot be hidden.\n\nIn the infosec world this is a hotly debated subject, with no clear solution that I know of.\n\nIn wireshark the filter 'ssl.handshake.extensions_server_name' can be used to extract these plaintext strings from a traffic capture.\n\nOpening, logging into, then logging off of my actual fund-holding MetaMask installation generated traffic to quite a few domains.\n\nsentry.io, infura.io, cryptocompare.com, metamask.github.io, connect.trezor.io, coingecko.com, and a few others like it.\n\nI have confirmed that blocking sentry.io using the method described in my Ledger Live post still allows MetaMask to transact correctly.\n\nI think thats all Ive got for today...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A FLAWED ANALYSIS CONTAINING INCORRECT INFORMATION </p>\n\n<p>FIND THE REVISION AT <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/102hi7y/revised_metamask_privacy_analysis/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/102hi7y/revised_metamask_privacy_analysis/</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the third installment of my series of posts regarding the privacy of various Chrome browser crypto wallet extensions.</p>\n\n<p>Previous posts in this series:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/zu3882/daily_general_discussion_december_24_2022/j1hybos/\">Series inspiration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/zx1yqe/daily_general_discussion_december_28_2022/j1zc0zv/\">Rabby</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/100d6c2/daily_general_discussion_january_1_2023/j2jdzfl/\">Tally Ho</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1014ypw/comment/j2nf0mt/\">Metamask</a> (or <a href=\"https://caches.xyz/the-rostrum/metamask-browser-extension-basic-security-analysis/\">view on Caches</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Im happy to report that after blocking the listed domains as described in that post, I am still able to use my Ledger device to send and receive as normal.</p>\n\n<p>Ok here&#39;s the deal.

Meaning that it is hardcoded, or generated on the fly by MetaMask itself.</p>\n\n<p>I did not bother to reinstall MetaMask to test this, its just extremely odd behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Look towards the bottom of the response section to see youtube setting a new cookie.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/rjGZhbh\">https://imgur.com/rjGZhbh</a></p>\n\n<p>The next request to youtube shows that MetaMask did not even make use of the newly set cookie sent by youtube. Again, youtube attempts to set a fresh cookie. </p>\n\n<p>And because MetaMask is willing to silently load every piece of javascript youtube has to offer, we again meet our friend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleclick\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleclick</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/uikkstC\">https://imgur.com/uikkstC</a></p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few requests to doubleclick. In fairness to MetaMask, I could not find anything that leads me to believe that they are using it to track you. This is youtube&#39;s tracking at work.</p>\n\n<p>Though, for context as to why I still find this so offensive I must link my personal cybersecurity blogpost pertaining to javascript <a href=\"https://fistfulofsecurity.blogspot.com/2021/06/detecting-cve-2018-16938-noscript-bypass.html\">https://fistfulofsecurity.blogspot.com/2021/06/detecting-cve-2018-16938-noscript-bypass.html</a></p>\n\n<p>If you wish to see some examples of what offensive and defensive security look like, check out my other posts there. Still all very basic stuff.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I wasnt super happy, and switched over to my actual MetaMask installation.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am not using burpsuite, but instead wireshark. I do not have the ability to view encrypted traffic in this environment. And as the following may contain my personal info, I will not be posting screenshots.</p>\n\n<p>On a separate note, I would like to clear up a misconception that many have about how TLS works.</p>\n\n<p>TLS obviously encrypts the data sent between the client and the server. Most people know that TLS does not hide the ip address you connect to. However, many people do not know that the <em>domain name</em> you are visiting cannot be hidden.</p>\n\n<p>In the infosec world this is a hotly debated subject, with no clear solution that I know of.</p>\n\n<p>In wireshark the filter &#39;ssl.handshake.extensions_server_name&#39; can be used to extract these plaintext strings from a traffic capture.</p>\n\n<p>Opening, logging into, then logging off of my actual fund-holding MetaMask installation generated traffic to quite a few domains.</p>\n\n<p>sentry.io, infura.io, cryptocompare.com, metamask.github.io, connect.trezor.io, coingecko.com, and a few others like it.</p>\n\n<p>I have confirmed that blocking sentry.io using the method described in my Ledger Live post still allows MetaMask to transact correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I think thats all Ive got for today...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-02 09:05:00","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-01-03 12:05:47","id":"j2nf0mt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1014ypw","parent_id":"t3_1014ypw","score":48,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/REALJohnBMacLemore","body":"As I suspected from Metamask.
