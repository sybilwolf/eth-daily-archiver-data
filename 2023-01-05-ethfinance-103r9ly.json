The main criticism boils down to the fact that there is no trust in the system (trustless), in the sense that there is no \"memory\" to build up trust. A miner is only trusted by spending computing resources right now, but does not get rewarded for building up a good reputation. He argues that although this is a perfectly fine model for security, it get's very expensive. In the concluding remarks, Budish briefly discusses PoS and says that it could potentially be used in a better way.\n\nI think his arguments for the cost of securing the Bitcoin network is interesting and probably valid (depending on what the attack looks like). People in crypto should not be arrogant and dismiss criticism, but instead try to understand all perspectives to be able to build better systems. I'm not sure how trust in a decentralized system would look, or even if it's a good idea (Any Layer0 player comments?). Also, PoS certainly have clear advantages: E.g., the cost of an attack is significantly larger, as the attacker risks losing the capital (not the case with mining). But if the capital required to secure the network needs to be way higher than the transactional value of the network, that could be an obstacle for growth. Are there any attempts to clearly work out the economics for PoS?\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks for the comments and suggestions to listen to Justin Drake on this, will take a look!\n\nI also found this quite intense twitter discussion on the subject: [https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1525505965029830656?s=20&t=X2P3CnyeNNKtinMsJCP9Ww](https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1525505965029830656?s=20&t=X2P3CnyeNNKtinMsJCP9Ww)\n\nAnd this blog post: [https://hugonguyen.medium.com/a-review-of-budishs-51-attack-theories-what-is-the-fair-price-of-an-old-asic-59a7dcf9ff94](https://hugonguyen.medium.com/a-review-of-budishs-51-attack-theories-what-is-the-fair-price-of-an-old-asic-59a7dcf9ff94) which argues that the scenarios in Budish article are unrealistic.

He argues that although this is a perfectly fine model for security, it get&#39;s very expensive. In the concluding remarks, Budish briefly discusses PoS and says that it could potentially be used in a better way.</p>\n\n<p>I think his arguments for the cost of securing the Bitcoin network is interesting and probably valid (depending on what the attack looks like). People in crypto should not be arrogant and dismiss criticism, but instead try to understand all perspectives to be able to build better systems. I&#39;m not sure how trust in a decentralized system would look, or even if it&#39;s a good idea (Any Layer0 player comments?). Also, PoS certainly have clear advantages: E.g., the cost of an attack is significantly larger, as the attacker risks losing the capital (not the case with mining). But if the capital required to secure the network needs to be way higher than the transactional value of the network, that could be an obstacle for growth. Are there any attempts to clearly work out the economics for PoS?</p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the comments and suggestions to listen to Justin Drake on this, will take a look!</p>\n\n<p>I also found this quite intense twitter discussion on the subject: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1525505965029830656?s=20&amp;t=X2P3CnyeNNKtinMsJCP9Ww\">https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1525505965029830656?s=20&amp;t=X2P3CnyeNNKtinMsJCP9Ww</a></p>\n\n<p>And this blog post: <a href=\"https://hugonguyen.medium.com/a-review-of-budishs-51-attack-theories-what-is-the-fair-price-of-an-old-asic-59a7dcf9ff94\">https://hugonguyen.medium.com/a-review-of-budishs-51-attack-theories-what-is-the-fair-price-of-an-old-asic-59a7dcf9ff94</a> which argues that the scenarios in Budish article are unrealistic.
