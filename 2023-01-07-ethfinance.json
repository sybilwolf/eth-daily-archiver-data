Fortunately, word has gotten around and the trend is improving.\n\nSo I think it's time to emphasize another problem in the relay space: *relays who also run builders*. Relay-builders as opposed to independent relays? I need a better term for this. This is informed by my time working on the [Aestus relay](https://aestus.live), and while I believe our relay can help with this problem, I hope you can trust that my goal here is not marketing. We don't make any money off this relay anyway.\n\n----\n\nIn a world without relays, proposers and builders would have to trust each other directly: depending on the implementation one would always be able to steal MEV from the other. Relays sit in the middle and take on all that trust. As long as the relay is trusted, proposers and builders each enter a trustless relationship with the other.\n\nHowever, a malicious relay, working with one side or the other, can execute all the attacks they were supposed to prevent. A relay working with a builder can steal MEV from a proposer or the other builders, and likewise, a relay working with a proposer can steal MEV from a builder.\n\nNow let's bring relay-builders into this. An entity that is running both a relay and a builder has a clear conflict of interest. Compromising the relay's neutrality by working together with their builder could immensely improve profitability. Let's list out some potential attacks that relay-builders could carry out. These are in roughly increasing order of subtlety and with names I'm making up on the spot, with \"you\" being the relay-builder:\n\n1. **Single-Block Copying**: Some third party builder has submitted a block to the relay that is more valuable than the block your builder made. Simply copy all the transactions from the third-party builder's block, but make it so *you* keep any value that is not sent to the proposer. Send a bid to the proposer with your block instead of the other builder's. A competent builder should be able to detect this and trash your reputation.\n2. **Ignoring Other Builders**: A third-party builder submitted a block more valuable than your builder's block. You *should* pass on the third-party bid to the proposer. Instead, pretend you didn't see it. Submit your builder's bid instead. Done naively like this, the third-party builder should be able to catch it.\n3. **Multi-Block Copying**: Multiple builders have submitted blocks with valuable MEV. Build your block from the most valuable transactions from each of them. Make sure your bid to the proposer will legitimately win the auction, but keep the rest of the MEV for yourself. I don't know if builders would detect this, might take some analysis and time.\n4. **Obfuscated MEV Copying**: Same as with the first two copying attacks, but with intent to be subtle about it. For example, if a third-party builder/searcher has a truly novel source of MEV extraction that only they know how to do, they'd recognize if it were stolen, so only copy MEV that can be identified as a recognizable strategy and is unlikely to come from a private mempool. Implement some fuzzing, make your copied MEV transactions slightly different so as to give plausible deniability that maybe your builder found that MEV on their own. Might be hard to detect.\n5. **Auction Manipulation**: Anyone can check the best current bid through the relay API, which is a problem in itself, but the relay has particularly low-latency access to this info. In case a third-party builder only very slightly outbids your builder, quickly create a new block with a winning bid and propose that instead. The relay has some wiggle room with timing to make sure your builder can always outbid. Catching this would require long-term analysis and may be covered by plausible deniability or obfuscation.\n6. **Block Timing Manipulation**: A third-party builder submitted a block more valuable than the one made by your builder. Give your block priority in the relay's block validation system, or better yet, don't waste time validating it at all (you made it, you trust it). Make your competitor's block low-priority for validation or otherwise stall it so it's less likely to be ready when the proposer asks for the best bid. Hard to detect, covered by plausible deniability, and current data APIs don't expose enough timing information to help with detection or can be manipulated. This could be an actual concern.\n7. **Builder Colocation**: Most builders will make ~1 submission per second, with value increasing over time as more bundles and tx's arrive. Builders that are geographically closer to the relay, with lower latency, will tend to have slightly higher-value blocks because of it. If a relay and builder are running in the same data center, under the same account/project, on a high-speed private LAN, that will give them a competitive edge. This maybe doesn't quite qualify as an attack, but a neutrality concern at least.\n\n----\n\nI want to be clear that **I have no reason to believe existing relay-builders are malicious and carrying out these attacks**. But why accept the possibility that they may some day occur? Why connect to relays that require extra trust assumptions when there are alternatives?\n\nRight now, Ultrasound and Agnostic are the only relays not operating their own builders. Aestus is temporarily running a builder, but it doesn't extract MEV, doesn't take any profit, and only operates until we get a reliable set of third-party builders connected (otherwise we might not have *any* blocks for connected proposers). I would encourage everyone to direct their validators and builders to those relays and to ask existing relay-builders to consider only running one or the other. I'm grateful to the early relay-builders for getting us off the ground, but now we can start to hold the space to a higher standard.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>MEV-Boost relay transaction censorship has gotten a good amount of attention since the Merge, and for good reason.

I want to qualify these as \"guesses\", because reality rarely unfolds as we expect and it would overestimate my foresight to call them predictions. Also, since I'm not making predictions, I acknowledge that it's difficult to quantify the results of many of these guesses.\n\n- Shanghai is likely to happen some time around Tuesday, March 28, 2023. This isn't based on any factual information and I'm VERY behind on core dev calls, but I do think that developers want to push this in March, and Tuesdays are a good day to do these. Guess confidence: 4%.\n\n- Network usage will skyrocket immediately after the merge as people race to take advantage of whatever strategy they've developed to respond to withdrawals. Some folks will be racing to claim stolen beacon chain funds, while others will be racing to save their funds from an attacker. Other people will have novel strategies that I can't conceive. This will lead to high execution rewards for validators who propose those blocks. Guess confidence: 20%.\n\n- MEV block rewards will be very high for several hours based on the previous point. Guess confidence: 15%\n\n- There will be few \"real\" validator exits, but there will be validator shuffling that will appear as exits and spook some people. For example, providers who have merged or folded will want to re-secure their keys under new management and will exit to re-stake under improved security, but this won't be clear to observers who will only perceive it as \"churn\". Guess confidence: 30%.\n\n- The price is likely to fluctuate 2% either way, but will quickly reach homeostasis because people are already committed to their positions. There will be sellers who have been eager to claim gains after having locked coins, and buyers who are comforted by the knowledge that withdrawals are real and sustainable. Guess confidence: 0%\n\n- Over the next year, individual deposits to the beacon chain will climb steadily as observers who couldn't commit to an unknown timeline now accept that the beacon chain is stable. I'm expecting 20 million staked Ether aka 625,000 validators by the end of 2023. Guess confidence: 5%\n\n- Large institutions will finally be comfortable depositing their treasuries into the beacon chain and taking staking rewards. This will occur over a 1-3 year period and result in significant locked coins. It remains to be seen whether they'll take a profit maximalist or chain maximalist approach to staking, but based on our educational efforts it's realistic to assume that many of these institutions will recognize the value of decentralization, trustlessness, and chain health when staking. Guess confidence: 10%\n\n- We'll see a new wave of LSD products, with products who support chain health leading the charge, and products who who maximize greed seeing less usage. In simple terms: institutions know that parasitic engagement with the beacon chain will reduce the long term viability of their investment. Guess confidence: 20%\n\n- Public goods like schools/universities, and local governments will slowly begin dipping their toes into staking, especially in cooperatives arranged around DVT solutions that help them dilute the risk of running validators. We ought to promote these cooperatives rather than encouraging centralized approaches. Guess confidence: 2%\n\n- We'll discover that some people and entities have lost staking keys. In the true fashion of cryptocurrency, I expect these keys to miraculously turn up in someone's private possession after many years. Guess confidence: 5%\n\n---\n\n**BONUS:** What our community can do to support this transition:\n\n- Educate everyone you can about the transition to Proof of Stake. Many people are still unaware that this has happened.\n\n- Talk to people about the relationship between \"good staking\" on a healthy network and the price. People who think they're staking selfishly will harm themselves by reducing decentralization. Staking in decentralized ways will have a positive impact on the price.\n\n- Help people recognize that withdrawals are a fruition of the promise by core developers to prioritize withdrawals after the merge. They deserve plenty of credit for being consistent and predictable.\n\n- Don't let people get complacent. So many people promised to move to solo home staking, or even just a better staking solution when withdrawals were enabled, but there's a natural tendency to get lazy and complacent when the opportunity is real - don't let people be lazy!\n\n- Keep learning and building.

That is when you could \"reverse rocketarb\" by **exiting** a minipool, the same way you can now rocketarb by **creating** a minipool. The deposit pool would be at 0, you exit, putting it at 16 and in the same breath you buy those 16 ETH equivalent of rETH at a discount from the market and sell it back to the protocol, making a profit. However, this will not quite work this way I believe because there's a queue/delay involved, which means the profit would not be taken by the minipool operator, but by an MEV bot instead. Personally I hope that the smart RP people will find a solution for this and bake rocketarb as well as reverse rocketarb natively into the protocol.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>minipool operators will be able to exit after shanghai.
