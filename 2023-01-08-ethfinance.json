Thats $20 billion, and 13% of total circulating ETH. Liquid staking derivatives have a total TVL of about $7 billion (Lido $6.2 bil, RPL, $0.6bil). I.e. 35% of staked ETH is in LSDs. \n\nIf post-Shanghai, % of staked ETH out of total ETH goes to 26% (tbh thats lowballing it because other PoS chains have an even higher % staked), and if all the LSD projects together become 50% of staked ETH (a 50% increase in market share from the currently 35%, which isn't unexpected because so many projects are working on liquid staking products, and withdrawals derisks all of them). \n\nThat means we would have $20 billion worth of LSDs (at current ETH prices) a few months or quarters post-Shanghai, or *$12 billion of new liquid staked ETH*\n\nAnd I think this is where things get interesting. Why would you use an LSD instead of running your own validator? Because its more convenient yes. But also because you can re-use that staked ETH as collateral to generate more capital. Say even a quarter of LSD owners use it as collateral, thats probably **$2 billion of new capital generated within the ethereum ecosystem.** (1/4 x 12bil x 66% LTV)\n\nAnd I feel most of my assumptions are dramatically low balling the adoption of staking, the adoption of LSDs, the price of ETH and the amount of LSDs that would be deposited on borrowing platforms for rehypothecation. \n\nStill, with that conservative estimate, $2 bil of \"new capital\" within the ethereum ecosystem can do a lot for the price action, when prices are this depressed. I'd expect most of that capital to buy more ETH, the dominant asset. Since the merge, for like the last 3+ months, there's only been 4 million (edit:4,000) additional ETH, or $5 million, released into the circulation. $2,000 million++ of ecosystem intrinsic money (not outside money, because fuck macro) trying to chase that few million $ of newly minted ETH is going to be interesting.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some back of the envelope calculations on LSDs, rehypothecation and perhaps the &quot;new capital&quot; that we&#39;ve been waiting for since instos were blown out this year.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s currently about <a href=\"https://beaconcha.in/charts/staked_ether\">15.8 million ETH staked on the beacon chan</a>. Thats $20 billion, and 13% of total circulating ETH. Liquid staking derivatives have a total TVL of about $7 billion (Lido $6.2 bil, RPL, $0.6bil). I.e. 35% of staked ETH is in LSDs. </p>\n\n<p>If post-Shanghai, % of staked ETH out of total ETH goes to 26% (tbh thats lowballing it because other PoS chains have an even higher % staked), and if all the LSD projects together become 50% of staked ETH (a 50% increase in market share from the currently 35%, which isn&#39;t unexpected because so many projects are working on liquid staking products, and withdrawals derisks all of them). </p>\n\n<p>That means we would have $20 billion worth of LSDs (at current ETH prices) a few months or quarters post-Shanghai, or <em>$12 billion of new liquid staked ETH</em></p>\n\n<p>And I think this is where things get interesting. Why would you use an LSD instead of running your own validator? Because its more convenient yes. But also because you can re-use that staked ETH as collateral to generate more capital. Say even a quarter of LSD owners use it as collateral, thats probably <strong>$2 billion of new capital generated within the ethereum ecosystem.</strong> (1/4 x 12bil x 66% LTV)</p>\n\n<p>And I feel most of my assumptions are dramatically low balling the adoption of staking, the adoption of LSDs, the price of ETH and the amount of LSDs that would be deposited on borrowing platforms for rehypothecation. </p>\n\n<p>Still, with that conservative estimate, $2 bil of &quot;new capital&quot; within the ethereum ecosystem can do a lot for the price action, when prices are this depressed. I&#39;d expect most of that capital to buy more ETH, the dominant asset.
