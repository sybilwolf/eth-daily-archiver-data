Basically appears that both companies who were in the red put IOUs on their books to make them look balanced. For Bitfinex/Tether, it pretty much worked to calm the bank run until they got out of the hole. For DCG/Genesis? TBD.\n\nI think Levine is typically not paywalled, but below is the meat in the event this article is paywalled for you. Nice dunk on Winklevoss at the end--the Terra/Luna situation really should have had set off alarm bells for Gemini to stop using Genesis back in May, but they kept them as a partner until it was too late.\n\n> Bitfinex is a crypto exchange, Tether is a stablecoin issuer, they are affiliated companies, and in 2018 they had an oopsie where Bitfinex lost a lot of customer money at a shady Panamanian money transmitter. If Bitfinex had gone out to its customers and said \u201chey we lost a bunch of your money,\u201d that would have been bad; they might have withdrawn the rest of their money. In fact they were withdrawing a lot of money, and Bitfinex was short on cash. So Bitfinex took $625 million from Tether, enough cash to pay out withdrawals. But that left Tether undercapitalized: It had issued a bunch of stablecoins that were supposed to be backed by $1 of assets per stablecoin, but now Bitfinex had taken $625 million of Tether\u2019s cash to pay out its customers. So Tether was no longer fully backed.\n\n> Ah, but it was! See, technically, Tether was backed by (1) all the assets it had previously had, (2) minus $625 million of cash, (3) plus a $625 million IOU from Bitfinex. If Bitfinex could return to profitability and stop losing money to Panamanian money transmitters, everything would be fine. \n> \n> This basically worked: There was no run on Tether, Bitfinex and Tether are both pretty lucrative businesses, and eventually the $625 million hole seems to have been closed. Tether got in trouble for it \u2014 it was sued by the New York attorney general and eventually settled \u2014 because this accounting is not, you know, super legitimate. \u201cTether is 100% backed by real dollar assets\u201d and \u201cTether is partly backed by an unsecured IOU from its sister company\u201d are almost the same, but not quite, and a traditional financial lawyer might be appalled by the difference. But a crypto shadow bank, ehh.\n\n...\n\n>Genesis Global Capital LLC is a crypto lending firm that is part of Digital Currency Group Inc., a collection of crypto businesses run by Barry Silbert; other DCG entities include Grayscale Investments LLC, which runs a lucrative business of exchange-traded crypto trusts. Genesis is an institutional lending firm \u2014 it takes money from big investors and lends it to hedge funds \u2014 but a big chunk of its money came from Gemini Earn, a retail crypto lending product run by the Winklevoss twins\u2019 crypto exchange, Gemini. In November, Genesis stopped repaying its depositors, including Gemini Earn customers, and recently Cameron Winklevoss has been writing public letters complaining about this. He sent another one today, asking DCG to fire Silbert, and it complains about exactly this sort of IOU transaction:\n\n>> Genesis lent $2.36 billion of assets to 3AC, a Singapore-based hedge fund that went belly up in June 2022. After collateral was liquidated, Genesis indicated that it was left with a loss of at least $1.2 billion. At this point, Barry Silbert had two legitimate options: restructure the Genesis loan book (inside or outside of bankruptcy court) or fill the $1.2 billion hole. He did neither. \u2026 Instead, he pretended to. \u2026 \n\n>> On July 6th, Michael Moro, then-CEO of Genesis, tweeted: \u201cDCG has assumed certain liabilities of Genesis related to [3AC] to ensure we have the capital to operate and scale our business for the long-term.\u201d\n\n>> This statement was false and misleading. In reality, DCG had not ensured that Genesis had the capital to operate. In fact, DCG hadn\u2019t given Genesis so much as a penny of actual funding to make up for the 3AC losses. Instead, DCG entered into a 10-year promissory note with Genesis at an interest rate of 1% \u2014 due in 2032. This note was a complete gimmick that did nothing to improve Genesis\u2019s immediate liquidity position or make its balance sheet solvent. \n\n>I disagree? The note was a complete gimmick that obviously improved Genesis\u2019s immediate liquidity position. 2 If DCG had not given Genesis this IOU, then Genesis would have been insolvent, its investors would have demanded their money back, there would have been a run on the bank and that would have been very bad for liquidity. But it did give Genesis the IOU, so nobody demanded their money back, so liquidity was fine! It\u2019s a gimmick, sure, but it\u2019s sort of the standard gimmick of crypto shadow banking, and it \u2026 uh \u2026 well, I guess it could work?\n\n> It ended up not working all that well here. As I said above, for this gimmick to work, you need two things: The market has to trust the IOU, and you have to stop losing money on bad loans. As far as I can tell, Genesis satisfied the first condition: DCG wrote it a $1.1 billion IOU in July, and customers like the Winklevoss twins decided that was good enough, so they did not withdraw their (clients\u2019) money. But it did not satisfy the second: When FTX collapsed in November, Genesis had more exposure, and had to shut down withdrawals anyway. If you trusted the IOU in July, you probably feel foolish now.

'Shilling' jpeg NFTs\n2. Bankless ads\n\n## First, NFTs.\n\nNFTs, and more specifically the collectible kind, are a fundamental part of this new world we're creating. Buying NFTs and talking about which ones are your favorites and why is a core part of this new future we're creating. I want to play too! Thinking that NFTs are this 0-sum game where the only purpose is to shill to produce a higher price, and then sell for profit I think is a paralyzing amount of cynicism.\n\nWe now have the technology to spawn a world of digital collectibles and cultural artifacts, and it's all built on Ethereum. Just because I am a representative of Web3 and an 'influeenncoooor' doesn't mean I ought to be excluded from this world. In fact, if I didn't partake in this world, I wouldn't be as informed and educated to do my job at Bankless.\n\nMaybe you don't agree with my take about the future of NFTs, but I'll drop two takes in here that I think are good:\n\n1. [https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1614073802907963393?s=20&t=0o-75D0bQYH6PpNk2x-QMQ](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1614073802907963393?s=20&t=0o-75D0bQYH6PpNk2x-QMQ)\n2. [https://twitter.com/0xLawl/status/1611491714358812672?s=20&t=0o-75D0bQYH6PpNk2x-QMQ](https://twitter.com/0xLawl/status/1611491714358812672?s=20&t=0o-75D0bQYH6PpNk2x-QMQ)\n\nThis isn't me just being an 80iq smoothbrain who thinks dicks are funny. There are deep mimetic properties that illustrating\n\n## Second, Bankless ads\n\nThis take is also supremely frustrating, aided by the fact that it's also such an easy take for other to pile onto. It's also an extremely lazy take.\n\nYou said yourself, you enjoy Bankless content. Behind every single episode of Bankless is\n\n* An audio engineer\n* A video editor\n* Agenda production, show notes, timestamps\n* Social media promotion\n* Operations work (to manage all the employees and sponsor relations).\n\nAll of these things cost money, and really that's just the tip of the iceberg. Bankless has done a ton of hiring in the background as well. A website developer, a product lead, a CTO...\n\nRyan and I are here to do one thing: promote the best of what this industry has to offer, as widely and broadly as possible. When we build structures to help achieve those ends, we can help steward Ethereum into its destined place in the world, and we can do that faster.\n\nWhen Bankless charges sponsors for ad revenue, and that ad revenue goes into building the company, we can scale out the content we produce and get more people to listen to it and more people to join the movement. If we're going to compete with the likes of Bitboy, then we *need* to do this.\n\nAnother huge point is that: **Sponsors aren't evil!** There are a lot of good quality products in the crypto space that deserves attention, and we have the opportunity to direct people who are interested in using these products, with the people making the products! That kind of cross-pollination between user and product is another way that we can help accelerate the adoption of good quality crypto products and make sure that they stick around for the long term.\n\nBut also, the biggest reason why I think the 'tOoO mAnY AdDSs!!1!' take is so lazy is this:\n\n## Then sign up for Bankless Premium.\n\nThe premium podcast feed is ad-free. If you really hate the ads that much, you can get the same Bankless episode that you know and love, without all the ads.\n\nIf you \\*don't\\* want to pay for Bankless premium, then do you really hate the ads all that much?\n\nA lot of people just want me and Ryan to produce 4 podcasts a week, 5 newsletter releases a week, and do it all for free, also while trying to grow Bankless to bring literally a billion people into crypto.\n\nTo really drive this point home: I love the daily gwei and anthony sassano as much as you guys. I use him for all of my Ethereum knowledge. But, his non-profit model is also why hes not going to capture audiences that aren't already bought into Ethereum.\n\nYou need a for-profit model in order to scale out to the masses, steal Bitboys audience, steal Web2's users, and help everyone go Bankless.\n\nHopefully, this helps you see things from our perspective.\n\ntl;dr: NFTs are important for crypto, and I want to be able to play that game without criticism. Bankless needs to be a for-profit company in the same way that ETH needs to have value to secure Ethereum.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Takes like these deeply sadden me.</p>\n\n<p>IMO, its an exclusionary perspective that&#39;s asking me &amp; Bankless to not take part in a very key aspect in what makes this industry work.</p>\n\n<p>There are two complaints here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>&#39;Shilling&#39; jpeg NFTs</li>\n<li>Bankless ads</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>First, NFTs.</h2>\n\n<p>NFTs, and more specifically the collectible kind, are a fundamental part of this new world we&#39;re creating. Buying NFTs and talking about which ones are your favorites and why is a core part of this new future we&#39;re creating. I want to play too! Thinking that NFTs are this 0-sum game where the only purpose is to shill to produce a higher price, and then sell for profit I think is a paralyzing amount of cynicism.</p>\n\n<p>We now have the technology to spawn a world of digital collectibles and cultural artifacts, and it&#39;s all built on Ethereum. Just because I am a representative of Web3 and an &#39;influeenncoooor&#39; doesn&#39;t mean I ought to be excluded from this world. In fact, if I didn&#39;t partake in this world, I wouldn&#39;t be as informed and educated to do my job at Bankless.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you don&#39;t agree with my take about the future of NFTs, but I&#39;ll drop two takes in here that I think are good:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1614073802907963393?s=20&amp;t=0o-75D0bQYH6PpNk2x-QMQ\">https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1614073802907963393?s=20&amp;t=0o-75D0bQYH6PpNk2x-QMQ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xLawl/status/1611491714358812672?s=20&amp;t=0o-75D0bQYH6PpNk2x-QMQ\">https://twitter.com/0xLawl/status/1611491714358812672?s=20&amp;t=0o-75D0bQYH6PpNk2x-QMQ</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t me just being an 80iq smoothbrain who thinks dicks are funny. There are deep mimetic properties that illustrating</p>\n\n<h2>Second, Bankless ads</h2>\n\n<p>This take is also supremely frustrating, aided by the fact that it&#39;s also such an easy take for other to pile onto. It&#39;s also an extremely lazy take.</p>\n\n<p>You said yourself, you enjoy Bankless content. Behind every single episode of Bankless is</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An audio engineer</li>\n<li>A video editor</li>\n<li>Agenda production, show notes, timestamps</li>\n<li>Social media promotion</li>\n<li>Operations work (to manage all the employees and sponsor relations).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All of these things cost money, and really that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. Bankless has done a ton of hiring in the background as well. A website developer, a product lead, a CTO...</p>\n\n<p>Ryan and I are here to do one thing: promote the best of what this industry has to offer, as widely and broadly as possible. When we build structures to help achieve those ends, we can help steward Ethereum into its destined place in the world, and we can do that faster.</p>\n\n<p>When Bankless charges sponsors for ad revenue, and that ad revenue goes into building the company, we can scale out the content we produce and get more people to listen to it and more people to join the movement. If we&#39;re going to compete with the likes of Bitboy, then we <em>need</em> to do this.</p>\n\n<p>Another huge point is that: <strong>Sponsors aren&#39;t evil!</strong> There are a lot of good quality products in the crypto space that deserves attention, and we have the opportunity to direct people who are interested in using these products, with the people making the products! That kind of cross-pollination between user and product is another way that we can help accelerate the adoption of good quality crypto products and make sure that they stick around for the long term.</p>\n\n<p>But also, the biggest reason why I think the &#39;tOoO mAnY AdDSs!!1!&#39; take is so lazy is this:</p>\n\n<h2>Then sign up for Bankless Premium.</h2>\n\n<p>The premium podcast feed is ad-free. If you really hate the ads that much, you can get the same Bankless episode that you know and love, without all the ads.</p>\n\n<p>If you *don&#39;t* want to pay for Bankless premium, then do you really hate the ads all that much?</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people just want me and Ryan to produce 4 podcasts a week, 5 newsletter releases a week, and do it all for free, also while trying to grow Bankless to bring literally a billion people into crypto.</p>\n\n<p>To really drive this point home: I love the daily gwei and anthony sassano as much as you guys. I use him for all of my Ethereum knowledge. But, his non-profit model is also why hes not going to capture audiences that aren&#39;t already bought into Ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>You need a for-profit model in order to scale out to the masses, steal Bitboys audience, steal Web2&#39;s users, and help everyone go Bankless.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, this helps you see things from our perspective.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr: NFTs are important for crypto, and I want to be able to play that game without criticism. Bankless needs to be a for-profit company in the same way that ETH needs to have value to secure Ethereum.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-14 14:07:10","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-01-14 21:01:56","id":"j4d8cqf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_108x76j","parent_id":"t1_j3wuoau","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timwithnotoolbelt","body":"Thanks for your reply and thanks for listening.
