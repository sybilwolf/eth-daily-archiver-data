Skip to the end if you would prefer a TL;DR.**\n\nNow is the perfect time to reflect on your own personal wins and regrets from the bull market just gone. It's quiet, fundamentals are showing strong with Ethereum's strength above $1,000 and a bottom feels like it may have formed. ^^Don't ^^@ ^^me ^^if ^^I ^^jinxed ^^it.\n\nPersonally, I'd give myself a 5/10. Overall I did ok.\n\n**The Good:**\n\nMy early bull run strategy was good. I sold the last of my Bitcoin after its initial run to $30K/40K as the first part of taking profits. I splashed out on a couple of things I'd been wanting for a while and I diversified into to physical assets as well as leaving some aside for paying tax (just not quite enough in the end \ud83d\ude43). Also, losses which will be covered in \"The Ugly\" were kept to a responsible (enough) % of my stack and I did not double down or try to gamble back shitcoin losses. Losses were accepted and rational portfolio allocations were stuck to. Once the shitcoins went to Goblintown, my precious ETH stack was left untouched.\n\nFinally, I managed to hit my 32 ETH target and run a solo validator node. It was a lot of learning for me but solo staking is very satisfying and worth the effort.\n\n**The Less Good:**\n\nI sold all of my shitcoins and was full ETH by the time the bear market kicked in to 5th gear. This allowed me to fund quitting my job temporarily to go to Hodlercon and do a long delayed trip with my family in the UK. I should have sold these earlier but I managed to shake these bags before we entered Goblintown.\n\n**The Bad:**\n\nI had a cash out plan and my target was not hit as I was hoping. My cash out plan evolved after an event I will cover in the next section. The bad thing is that part of my target was hit and I did nothing about it.\n\n**The Ugly:**\n\n35% of my stack was lost to shitcoins in 2020 and DeFi coins in 2021. Overconfidence from picking out Chainlink in the 2018 bear and then selling the top in late 2019/early 2020 contributed to this greatly. It was a humbling experience but also, unfortunately this loss of 35% of my stack was the reason why my cash out target was not hit. I had a set $ amount I wanted to sell (which would be hit at around a $4.5K ETH) or when a bunch of my favourite indicators on www.LookIntoBitcoin.com flashed sell. After losing the 35%, the cash out amount crept up since I had less ETH to sell (it went up to about a $9K ETH). Due to the elongated nature of the late bull run, less than half of the sell indicators I was following flashed sell. I tried to time the peak too close. As a result, the peak I expected never came and I never sold when I should have.\n\n**Learnings:**\n\nSo what have I learned and what can you learn from me? My first piece of advice is never to double down to re-coup losses. After I lost my shitcoin stack I was tempted to double down and I had other coins lined up. But guess what, those coins did terribly. I would have only lost more ETH and wouldn't be solo staking today. Set aside a portion of your stack to leave invested in ETH for the long run. Do not waver from this allocation. If you find that hard, maybe staking is for you. A 16 ETH rETH minipool or 32 ETH solo node cannot be partially sold. It's a great way to keep assets locked in for your long term investment thesis, also earn a yield and of course help to decentralise Ethereum!\n\nSecondly, I think it's important to stick to a cash out plan. Furthermore, I think laddering out is better too. It's easy to want to hit a target but this market is too unpredictable to rely on such a hit or miss strategy. Everyone is different, so I don't think this strategy suits everyone but if you are someone with a cash out plan, I'd recommend sticking to it and I'd also recommend having multiple targets over a single cash out price.\n\nMy final piece of advice is to stay humble and stay cautious. Now that I have experienced the feeling of winning a big bet on one of just 2 altcoins to go on a big run up last bear market and subsequently thinking I'm a genius and can do it again, I see this attitude everywhere. Look at Do Kwon or any of the has beens last bull run. They think they can make a comeback and are trying to build up their redemption arcs. They got lucky. Then they got overconfident and greedy. Then the market turned and their shenanigans that they thought was proof they were geniuses revealed that they really aren't any better than the rest of us. In fact, they're worse. At least I kept my losses limited and didn't keep leveraging up. Keeping my bullishness and self-confidence in check is the only reason I didn't lose it all. There were definitely points where I wanted to go all in on my shitcoins but I didn't because I knew it was irresponsible.\n\nAnyway, I apologise for the long-winded nature of this post. I don't really have the time today to flesh it out into a nice concise ordered write up. I guess I'll leave you with a TL;DR instead.\n\n#TL;DR:\n\n- Stay humble. Watch out for the trap of over-confidence after you make a smart investment or two thinking you can do it again. Chances are you can't.\n\n- Keep responsible allocations. I'd have lost it all had I not resisted the urge to double down in an effort to recoup losses. Running a staking node can help with this.\n\n- I recommend cash out plans and sticking to them. Furthermore, laddered cash out plans help protect against uncertainty. My all or nothing plan has left me frustrated and short on liquidity in this bear.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Disclaimer: This is a long-winded reflective post.

The bad thing is that part of my target was hit and I did nothing about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Ugly:</strong></p>\n\n<p>35% of my stack was lost to shitcoins in 2020 and DeFi coins in 2021. Overconfidence from picking out Chainlink in the 2018 bear and then selling the top in late 2019/early 2020 contributed to this greatly. It was a humbling experience but also, unfortunately this loss of 35% of my stack was the reason why my cash out target was not hit. I had a set $ amount I wanted to sell (which would be hit at around a $4.5K ETH) or when a bunch of my favourite indicators on <a href=\"http://www.LookIntoBitcoin.com\">www.LookIntoBitcoin.com</a> flashed sell. After losing the 35%, the cash out amount crept up since I had less ETH to sell (it went up to about a $9K ETH). Due to the elongated nature of the late bull run, less than half of the sell indicators I was following flashed sell. I tried to time the peak too close. As a result, the peak I expected never came and I never sold when I should have.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So what have I learned and what can you learn from me? My first piece of advice is never to double down to re-coup losses. After I lost my shitcoin stack I was tempted to double down and I had other coins lined up. But guess what, those coins did terribly. I would have only lost more ETH and wouldn&#39;t be solo staking today. Set aside a portion of your stack to leave invested in ETH for the long run. Do not waver from this allocation. If you find that hard, maybe staking is for you. A 16 ETH rETH minipool or 32 ETH solo node cannot be partially sold. It&#39;s a great way to keep assets locked in for your long term investment thesis, also earn a yield and of course help to decentralise Ethereum!</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I think it&#39;s important to stick to a cash out plan. Furthermore, I think laddering out is better too. It&#39;s easy to want to hit a target but this market is too unpredictable to rely on such a hit or miss strategy. Everyone is different, so I don&#39;t think this strategy suits everyone but if you are someone with a cash out plan, I&#39;d recommend sticking to it and I&#39;d also recommend having multiple targets over a single cash out price.</p>\n\n<p>My final piece of advice is to stay humble and stay cautious. Now that I have experienced the feeling of winning a big bet on one of just 2 altcoins to go on a big run up last bear market and subsequently thinking I&#39;m a genius and can do it again, I see this attitude everywhere. Look at Do Kwon or any of the has beens last bull run. They think they can make a comeback and are trying to build up their redemption arcs. They got lucky. Then they got overconfident and greedy. Then the market turned and their shenanigans that they thought was proof they were geniuses revealed that they really aren&#39;t any better than the rest of us. In fact, they&#39;re worse. At least I kept my losses limited and didn&#39;t keep leveraging up. Keeping my bullishness and self-confidence in check is the only reason I didn&#39;t lose it all. There were definitely points where I wanted to go all in on my shitcoins but I didn&#39;t because I knew it was irresponsible.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I apologise for the long-winded nature of this post. I don&#39;t really have the time today to flesh it out into a nice concise ordered write up. I guess I&#39;ll leave you with a TL;DR instead.</p>\n\n<h1>TL;DR:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Stay humble. Watch out for the trap of over-confidence after you make a smart investment or two thinking you can do it again. Chances are you can&#39;t.</p></li>\n<li><p>Keep responsible allocations. I&#39;d have lost it all had I not resisted the urge to double down in an effort to recoup losses. Running a staking node can help with this.</p></li>\n<li><p>I recommend cash out plans and sticking to them. Furthermore, laddered cash out plans help protect against uncertainty. My all or nothing plan has left me frustrated and short on liquidity in this bear.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-12 03:22:37","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-01-12 03:31:40","id":"j40rrwq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_109rzd5","parent_id":"t3_109rzd5","score":77,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"So after like 6.5 years in this market my investment thesis TLDR; still boils down to \"where is the sell button ser\" and \"one day we will hit 20k\"... and I'm pretty sure I will go through the 2025 bull market again without selling cuz youtubers be telling my dumbass about 200k eth lmao.\n\nOh well... as long as the next bear bottom is like 4.5k.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So after like 6.5 years in this market my investment thesis TLDR; still boils down to &quot;where is the sell button ser&quot; and &quot;one day we will hit 20k&quot;... and I&#39;m pretty sure I will go through the 2025 bull market again without selling cuz youtubers be telling my dumbass about 200k eth lmao.</p>\n\n<p>Oh well... as long as the next bear bottom is like 4.5k.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-12 04:53:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j410fu7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_109rzd5","parent_id":"t1_j40rrwq","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/danseidansei","body":"My thoughts exactly.

I can see them eventually releasing something that&#39;s interoperable with a handful of countries, i.e. a couple in the EU, Japan, Singapore, maybe the US etc. that will be based on old tech and have many restrictions and much friction. The poorer countries with worse institutions won&#39;t be allowed to join, while Russia, China and similar countries <em>will not want to join</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If Ethereum worked the same way as central banks, we would likely still be in theory-only mode and aiming for plasma. The Swedish Central bank actually started their CBDC project 2016 and is still in private testing. We are building a global, decentralized and neutral settlement-layer, something they can never compete with!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-12 09:05:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j420chm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_109rzd5","parent_id":"t3_109rzd5","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pa7x1","body":"They won't use Ethereum but then you want to settle between ECB and Fed and China's Central Bank and who do you trust?

I did a similar one around June 2022 after the Luna/3AC implosion and what I hope were the cycle lows and found it very useful. \n\nTLDR: Like many of us I did incredibly (lifechangingly) well in 2021 - did all the right things after the previous bear, got in early, didn't trade (well not much - the trading was actually profitable) but I'm sitting here now 90-95% down from the May 2021 peak (haven't calculated exact figure - too painful) simply because I didn't sell and take enough profits (I did take some profits - paid off all debts, some nice holidays and things but not even close to being enough to move the needle). \n\nSo that begs the question - why didn't I sell? It's not as simple as just saying \"greed\" although that had a role too.  \n\nFirst, the May 2021 peak/dump totally blindsided me - some Elon tweets and some China FUD and suddenly we were down 50% - I can't really blame myself for that too much. \n\nBut the Nov 2021 peak was really obvious even at the time, and I remember reading tweets about it and the changing macro conditions and QT etc and literally thinking \"maybe I should cash out atleast 30% or something - not everything\" and then not doing it. I still beat myself up about that. \n\nSo then the question is why? And I finally figured out that the answer is that I wasn't thinking long term - I was behaving on some instinctive level like I have only one shot to \"make it\" in crypto and thinking very short term (because of regulation among other things). \n\nIf you think like that, then the incentive is to stay in and gamble even when your instincts and data are telling you to get out - because if it's your ONLY chance to make it, then you may as well as stay in as long as you haven't hit your target. If you believe deep down this is a long term game, then the incentive is take the profits you've made, get out, enjoy them and wait for the next cycle to hit \"final\" target. If I'd actually done that, I'd have exited 30-50% in Nov 2021 and chilled out waiting for the next cycle. \n\nNow the market decided to force me to wait for the next cycle anyway, with a damn sight less capital and assets than I would have had if I'd done what I actually thought about doing in Nov 2021. \n\nThe real irony was that in May 2021 (not Nov 2021) I actually hit my first \"cash it all out\" target and greed kept me in long enough for Elon and China to tank the market (I had a very DeFi heavy portfolio so the Nov 2021 peak was not above the target for me). \n\nAnyway, I'm not going anywhere - I'll be here for the next cycle too and damn sure taking at least SOME profits at max euphoria time. Just a lot less than I could have been taking if I'd been disciplined enough to cash out in Nov 2021 and buy back a chunk in June 2022..\n\nPS - 2021 was my second cycle, depending on whether we're counting partial or full cycles. Came to crypto towards the end of the 2017 bull so 2021 was my second bull but I'd only had the 2018-19 bear.\n\nEDIT: Just to add - the \"no blow off top\" thing you mention was also a huge factor in my rationalizations.

I had an interest in crypto since 2012 but really didn't have the money to be risking it until 2016 which is when I felt confident enough to enter the market.\n\nI made some absolutely disgusting gains in the ICO frenzy buying into some projects before they were listed and flipping for insane profits into ETH right after listing.\n\nWhilst my ETH gains during the 2017 run were great, I failed to cash out enough before the crash and endured the long bear after. I also had a large opportunity loss hodling onto junk way longer than I should have such as OMG. I did sell that for a profit in the end but could have made much better returns elsewhere.\n\nCome our latest bullmarket I was determined to make sure I made a larger paper profit exit. I decided I could not trust my lizard brain to make the right choices once the greed of the bull market kicked in.\n\nSo I set up laddered exit plan with automated sells set up along the way that would average out to be a pretty good price regardless of where we ended up. I just had to accept that I wasn't going to time the exact top but fortunately most of my sold coins were in the top 20% price range of what turned out to be the peak price.\n\nI'm very happy with the profits I achieved this run and considering the amount I initially invested since 2016 I have no right to complain and won't. Whilst it's not shit on my bosses desk money (I guess it could be depending on how you look at it) it has bought me one thing which is security.\n\nWhich is something I value greatly, especially going into a new year which I know many people are doing it tough and will continue to do it tough. It's allowed me to also help some of those closest to me get out of some shitty situations of no fault of their own and into some more stability.\n\nI mark myself down for not really having the appetite I had for exploring the space as I had in 2017. I missed the hype with NFTs, a lot of DEFI space, airdrops and of course the shitcoin roulette. If I the same crypto fever I had in 2017 I could have made a killing.\n\nIn my defence since the pandemic started I have been incredibly time poor and didn't have time to play the hot potato game.\n\nSince 2019 I've created, run and sold a business whilst holding down a day job. A year and a few days ago I was almost killed in a freak event, it's changed my perspective on things as these things often do. It would have being and incredibly dumb and laughably sad way of going.\n\nIt's taken me most of the last year to wind up a bunch of stuff in my life to get a better balance. I've been trying to fix the time poor thing as a result for the last month I have basically disconnected from everything proper. Just enjoying traveling and time with friends and family without other distractions. I haven't done this for the past few years.\n\nA final note make sure to spend time with the people you care about, life is short. I will still be around, you know the old rule never sell all of your crypto. Already setting up my positions for the next run, whenever that might be.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Really enjoyed reading <a href=\"/u/Tricky_Troll\">u/Tricky_Troll</a> reflection post <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/109rzd5/comment/j40rrwq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So here&#39;s my reflection on my performance for the last bull market.</p>\n\n<p>Overall score: 7/10</p>\n\n<p>First a bit of context on my crypto journey.</p>\n\n<p>My first bullmarket was in 2017 after I started buying mostly ETH in late 2016.
