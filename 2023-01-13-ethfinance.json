It's also at the core of many zero-knowledge proof systems.\n\nThe gist of is you can it to prove that two polynomial functions are equal extremely efficiently: Instead of comparing the coefficients one by one, you simply evaluate them at a random point `s` and if `P(s) = Q(s)`, we say that `P` and `Q` are equal. Now it's definitely possible that they're not actually equal, and only happen to output the same value when taking `s` as an input. But we're taking about polynomials with so many coefficients over such a large domain, that the odds that this happens are is so incredibly slim you might as well be worried about your neighbor generating a new seed phrase that happens to be yours.\n\nNow there is one problem: Nobody can know `s`. If you know `s`, then you can work backwards from it and come up with a function `Q` such that even though it's different from `P`, `Q(s)` still equals `P(s)`, and it won't be by chance. If you can do that, you can break the whole thing and you can make fake zk proofs that look legit and do all sorts of nasty stuff.\n\nTo remedy this problem, KZG uses elliptic curve cryptography as a way to \"encrypt\" numbers while preserving the ability to add, multiply, and compare them. Now we can do math on a number that nobody knows, because we only know its encrypted version. e.g. encrypting `s` first and then multiplying the encrypted value by 2 will give you the same encrypted value as if you first multipled `s` by 2 and then encrypted `2s`. So we use that as a building block to do the thing we want: check that `P(s) = Q(s)` without knowing `s`\n\nNow we have a different problem: *Someone* had to compute the encrypted version of `s`! (Specifically, they had to compute the encrypted version of `s`, `s^2`, `s^3`, and so on for as many coefficients as the polynomial functions have). So you're basically left trusting that whoever generated `s` threw it away after revealing the encrypted version, because if they kept it, they have the power to mess with proofs and stuff as mentioned above.\n\nThankfully, there is a way to mitigate this trust problem: If you give me your encrypted `s`, I can simply add my own secret `q` and \"merge\" it with yours. Without ever knowing your `s`, I can now reveal to the world the encrypted value of `s+q`. Now you can't make fake proofs, because you'd need my `q` to figure out the new secret `s+q`, and likewise I can't make fake proofs, because I don't know your `s`.\n\nBut of course, we *could* collude together if we both kept our respective numbers, so this isn't enough. We need to scale this to thousands of participants, each one generating a random number, encrypting it, and merging it with the previous secret number to come up with a new secret number that the next participant will use. That's what the KZG ceremony is! Everyone has a chance to contribute a random secret and all it takes is one honest person following the honest steps of generating a secret, merging it, and throwing it away afterwards (which is what the default browser app does, it collects entropy from as many sources as it can - you'd really have to go out of your way to keep the secret you're committing) and Ethereum will have one random number `s` that absolutely no one knows, so all the 4844 blobs and zkproof stuff will work like they're supposed to.\n\nThe ceremony will go on for 2 months to leave enough time for everyone to participate. After a certain number of participants it mostly becomes symbolic, but the more participants we have the better it is from a narrative standpoint in terms of credible neutrality (compared to say, if the only participants had been EF insiders). So you should definitely check it out and participate, if anything just for the fun of having participated in Ethereum's security and knowing for a fact that you did it honestly, therefore there is 0% trust involved from you when it will be used in the protocol. For people who don't participate, the level of trust needed will be 0.000000...00001% because cmon it's just not realistic that like 8k participants all came together and colluded lol\n\nI hope this makes sense.
