I've noticed an increasing number of OG users here grow disenfranchised with Bankless for whatever reason. Back when you first launched many of us here were big fans, but lately I feel like there is a rift in this community over their opinions on Bankless. I can see where they are coming from but things change as you scale out to a larger audience. You're right that something like The Daily Gwei simply can't scale out to onboard 1 billion people and that's where bringing on guests like BitBoy, despite the inevitable criticism you'll get for it, will help pull folks into communities like Bankless or EthFinance where the signal to noise ratio is much much better.\n\nAt the end of the day you can't make a difference without having haters or receiving criticism. Personally I think you and Ryan are doing a stellar job all things considered. Sure, there are a lot of ads, some of which haven't aged well these last couple of years but you've owned up to that and are making a concerted effort to accept crypto values aligned sponsors. It's a real shame about RocketPool sponsorship too. I think the RP community made a mistake there. How can they expect to grow without advertising in more mainstream circles and I feel like Bankless is the perfect meeting of mainstream appeals without compromising on crypto values.\n\nFinally, shilling is a necessary part of spreading the word of crypto. I've never understood why people seem to get upset when someone shares something they own or are invested in, just as long as you're not being paid to shill it then it's fine in my books. On the other hand, if you are being paid, it's pretty easy to be transparent about the fact that you are being paid. However a surprising number of influencers don't do that.

This community has already forked over that kind of thing and we don't plan on doing it again.)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you for sharing your perspective, David. I&#39;ve noticed an increasing number of OG users here grow disenfranchised with Bankless for whatever reason. Back when you first launched many of us here were big fans, but lately I feel like there is a rift in this community over their opinions on Bankless. I can see where they are coming from but things change as you scale out to a larger audience. You&#39;re right that something like The Daily Gwei simply can&#39;t scale out to onboard 1 billion people and that&#39;s where bringing on guests like BitBoy, despite the inevitable criticism you&#39;ll get for it, will help pull folks into communities like Bankless or EthFinance where the signal to noise ratio is much much better.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day you can&#39;t make a difference without having haters or receiving criticism. Personally I think you and Ryan are doing a stellar job all things considered. Sure, there are a lot of ads, some of which haven&#39;t aged well these last couple of years but you&#39;ve owned up to that and are making a concerted effort to accept crypto values aligned sponsors. It&#39;s a real shame about RocketPool sponsorship too. I think the RP community made a mistake there. How can they expect to grow without advertising in more mainstream circles and I feel like Bankless is the perfect meeting of mainstream appeals without compromising on crypto values.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, shilling is a necessary part of spreading the word of crypto. I&#39;ve never understood why people seem to get upset when someone shares something they own or are invested in, just as long as you&#39;re not being paid to shill it then it&#39;s fine in my books. On the other hand, if you are being paid, it&#39;s pretty easy to be transparent about the fact that you are being paid. However a surprising number of influencers don&#39;t do that. Speaking of which, we now expect you to shill $DOOT when daily doots get airdropped to doot recipients like you. Haha just kidding. <sup>No, seriously, there are no plans for a doot token.

Don't know if I am \"too late\" to give my feedback, but I want to share it in any case, especially since you asked for it. \n\nLet me start with the following. Bankless was my first podcast as in it was the first I enjoy listening regularly. It was great content back in 2020 and it still is great content. I don't like all the episodes, but that's okay, I dont have to, it's a lot of content anyways. \n\nLet me start with a suggestion: Ask Cobie for an hour of his time to get some detailed thoughts and explanations after the FTX drama and how that changed his perspective on sponsors. \n\nDisclaimer: I know (!) bankless isn't up only and I know the concepts, teams etc. are very different job vs hobby, 2 men vs 20 etc. But still I think his opinion would be **very** interesting. \n\nNow my feedback: \n\n\\- I see that they way sponsors are presented has changed already. In the beginning everything was \"bankless favorite X\", but the problem of course was that sometimes similar products would be sponsor and they can't be \"favorite\" in the same category. So the problem is that the sponsors want you to endorse it with your personal flavour, words and backing, but imo that's bullshit. I know that's how \"influencers\" work, but that doesn't change my opinion. Ask them to write down what they want you to read. Then read it out loud, end of story. \n\n\\- stop doing ads for centralized entities. And just for the sake of your own credibility and the longterm business that you've built. You have NO idea how kraken is run internally. Worst case scenario is that kraken needs you for new deposits to stay solvent (and yes! I understand proof of reserves/ liabilities, but that still doesn't really help, still too young as an idea/ too many ways to bypass) \n\n\\- stop ads on twitter. This is in the end \"bankless favorite\" all over again and these ads won't age well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have a great product. That means you can say / control / demand how ads implemented, because if one sponsor doesn't accept your terms there will be another one happily accepting to get the chance to present the product to your audience. \n\nYou can run a viable business with 20 people and still say \"no\" to certain partners/ terms/ etc. \n\nI understand that it's always hard when things change, that it's hard for people that \"grew up\" with bankless to see things they don't 100% understand/ endorse/ etc. But if a rather big group of people voice concerns you should listen and try to understand if there is some truth to what they are saying. And of course you can also just make the decision to change your audience and basically leave the hardcore niche behind to focus on a broader market that just expects different stuff because you feel your mission needs this change.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Just found this post via the daily doots.

Is Curve subject to a death or decay spiral like Luna or Harvest have been? Trading fees are the only source of revenue for Curve at the moment. These have to offset some pretty high inflation. Curve actually takes **50%** of the trading fees from LPs. It compensates them for this loss with CRV issuance. In *one* sense the fair market value of CRV is the issuance divided by value of the trading fees forfeited by LPs. This is basically the price LPs bought the issuance for as though it was some kind of bond. I know it's actually a different value for each pool if you break it down but I find it interesting how different the average value forfeited by LPs to get CRV is from the value of the CRV they received (exercise left to the reader). Generally speaking, some pools like 3crv without a particular DAO sponsor get a lot less than their trading fees back and pools with a DAO sponsor get more so long as that DAO is voting with veCRV. To get any of this issuance at all as an LP you have to either pair your position with veCRV or deposit it to something like Convex which does that for you but I digress.\n\nThe way this is built today entire ecosystems are dependent on the value of CRV being issued to be high enough to provide an APR to generate demand for their tokens. So, as our first thought exercise, what would happen if the CRV price crashed to basically 0? Are there corrective forces that would help the price recover or would the system crash to 0 and stay there like Luna or Bancor? This is the death spiral scenario.\n\nTo be sure a CRV=$0 event would be catastrophic for DAOs like Frax and Alchemix. Anyone holding alUSD trying to get APR to match inflation would fold when the APR drops to like 0.1% or whatever the native trading APR is. However, there is a large pile of capital on Curve that is *already* getting the short end of the stick when it comes to fees taken by the DAO vs CRV received such as 3crv, stETH, FraxBP, tricrypto, etc. This capital is either there because of rewards in some other token like LDO or just because the trading rewards are still competitive after accounting for IL compared to Uniswap v3. So I take at least a large fraction of this capital as the base layer Curve revenue source.\n\nDo these fees help to self-correct a CRV=$0 event? Yes. The fees taken by the DAO are turned into 3crv and paid out. At face value that doesn't affect the CRV price. However, there are a lot of auto-compounders that turn this 3crv back into more CRV and max lock it (aCRV, sdCRV, bcvxCRV, uCRV, etc). This is non-discretionary buyback pressure on the CRV asset. In response to this style event this system is closer to a self-correcting one than an unstable equilibrium that just hasn't crashed *yet*. This is promising.\n\nHowever there's a similar question with a different answer. What will the fate of this ecosystem be as CRV issuance decays towards 0. Right now the inflation percent is over 25%. Within 3 years it will decay down to 4%. If the main reason to hold CRV is to direct the issuance of future CRV, what happens when the amount issued drops by 6x? From the perspective of DAOs in the CRV wars, unless the CRV price goes up 6x or they acquire 6x the market share they won't be able to maintain the same APR they do today for their LPs. So they will either have to shrink their operations or incentivize a different ecosystem that can get them a higher APR.\n\nWe've seen processes like this play out with Harvest. When the issuance was high the 30% fee the DAO took from LPs was offset by FARM issuance. Every week the FARM issuance decayed and so did the LP APR. As the deal became less fair every week the protocol TVL has decayed. It's now down to 13M TVL. Is this Curve's destiny as well? There are similarities in their design. As the monetary power of veCRV falls with issuance, the CRV price should fall as well. A falling CRV price will compound the issuance reduction to bring the LP APR down aggressively. Rates falling will result in capital flight, similar to what happened to Harvest.\n\nSome quick napkin math. Let's pessimistically assume 65% of the 400M CRV issued in the next year is sold. At current prices that's $208M in sell pressure. That's ~10x the exchange revenue I see reported on DefiLlama. To sustain CRV prices at this issuance Curve needs to find more buyers and get that 35% lock rate up.\n\nThere are a few differences in this ecosystem from decay spirals we have seen though. These should stop it from decaying to 0 even if current valuations are unsustainable.\n\n1) There is a steady demand from various DAOs and liquid lockers who have committed to buy CRV continuously. At the high about 55% of CRV was locked in veCRV with an average lock time of about 3.84/4 years. Now that has fallen to about 47% of veCRV with about 35% of new CRV issued being locked. Again, some of this is non-discretionary. BNT never had this type of systemic buy pressure to safe it from collapse.\n\n2) Even if the inflation is at 28% of circulating supply this year you can make 40.93% on yCRV right now. That's a hell of a lot of APR. The more the CRV price falls, the higher this APR is. Also the fewer people that lock, the higher this APR is. It's already enough to recoup any initial buy you make today in a few years *if* the CRV price holds up.\n\n3) All of the above death spiral arguments would have been even more true 2 years ago before CRV went from $0.35 to $6.50. Inflation was higher then. The main thing that has changed in my mind is that veCRV was monotonically increasing at that time and it isn't any more.\n\nSo I do think there is a market floor on the CRV price but I'd need to think about it more to derive it numerically. In the meantime the best thing Curve can do is increase it's revenue (which gets that veCRV APR even higher).\n\nThe first has to do with an expansion of the trading volume in Curve. That's a tough market with Balancer taking more of the LSD volume share lately and Uniswap just generally dominating. There is a feature of Curve v2 pools I think is underappreciated which help reduces IL but I'm not sure if it compensates for 50% of your trading volume compared to Uniswap's 0%. Other cool Dex features they could add in some Curve v3 development include parameterized volatility-based capital withdrawals, asymmetric liquidity positions like Carbon is building, single-sided liquidity like Bancor failed at, IL insurance which could be built as a layer on top of a Dex, deploying 'idle' capital in the Dex to money markets for extra yield, and doing something like Synthetix does for 0 slippage trades. I'm not placing my hopes on this direction but it isn't *hopeless*. Another alternative is just that Defi gets 6x bigger and Curve at least maintains market share. That seems more likely, especially if Forex markets take off in the next run.\n\nThe second has to do with crvUSD. Basically they have a CDP style system that has a gradual rather than discrete liquidation system that dramatically lowers risk. I'm not sure what the collateral types will be but tri-crypto is likely. I don't know if it uses the same pools as Curve v1 and Curve v2 for the liquidations but honestly the whitepaper wasn't fully clear on that point and it's under development. An ideal scenario would not only use existing Curve pools for the liquidation system but would enable LPs to use their LP token as collateral for crvUSD loans. I've seen optimistic estimates the revenue from these loans this can double Curve's revenue stream. If 28% of the 41% yCRV is just par inflation for veCRV holders, then 13% is still profit somewhere. Doubling that would bring us to 54% APR. I don't think yCRV can sustain a 54% APR without forcing the price up, even in the face of 28% inflation.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Little thought exercise on CRV.

I'll extend on them.\n\nCRV has intrinsic value, because it has two major utility cases:\n\n* facilitating swaps (and collecting fees for this)\n* directing liquidity through gauges\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Fees**\n\nThe first one is quite easy to grasp, but it does not put current CRV price in good light. Curve's spending is 28% (borrowing that number from OP) of its market cap. This is distributed as CRV incentives to keep the wheel turning (i.e. paying liquidity provider for their... liquidity). This is a huge amount of $**145m** this year! \n\nThis allows the platform to collect roughly $100k a day from its customers who use its swap service. This sums up to $36.5m yearly (\\~7% APR). Therefore, the platofrm is loosing value. If cost of attracting customer would not fall, then it actually would mean slow death of the protocol. But...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Liquidity**\n\nFacilitating swaps is a simple B2C model. People want to swap tokens, they pay for the service. But there is another cash generating model behind this facade. Providing liquidity for other projects. This is a standard B2B relation. Many (most of?) DeFi project require liquidity to function, hence they will share their revenue with whomever can reliably provide it. They could start their own liquidity incentives via staking model, but it is very costly and short lasting. The better option is to rent it from an industry leader. Bigger projects (like yearn) buy CRV directly, which makes this very costly but at the same a long term solution, and also increases their treasury value. Others, if not most, use bribes model, where they pay big CRV holders (like Convex) so that they can direct this sweet liquidity toward their tokens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow much this liquidity is worth? I don't want to start digging right now, but I bet on a yearly $100m. Why? Because this is the missing income part that could explain current price equilibrium. This also makes sense, if you look at bribe services APR and their tokens APR, e.g. Convex cvxCRV gives 3.54% base APR + 26.4% from bribes. This value makes a lot of sense, as it is close to inflation value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you add expected growth, I think CRV is undervalued. I have some doubts if this all will hold year after year with withering inflation rewards, but my educated guess is: **yes, it will**. Curve is providing a very good service that is needed in this space. Has great team and top-notch math behind its models (this why they have high vol/tvl ratio!). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer: I hold around 1% of my portfolio in CRV.*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Good thoughts.

This is a huge amount of $<strong>145m</strong> this year! </p>\n\n<p>This allows the platform to collect roughly $100k a day from its customers who use its swap service. This sums up to $36.5m yearly (~7% APR). Therefore, the platofrm is loosing value. If cost of attracting customer would not fall, then it actually would mean slow death of the protocol. But...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Liquidity</strong></p>\n\n<p>Facilitating swaps is a simple B2C model. People want to swap tokens, they pay for the service. But there is another cash generating model behind this facade. Providing liquidity for other projects. This is a standard B2B relation. Many (most of?) DeFi project require liquidity to function, hence they will share their revenue with whomever can reliably provide it. They could start their own liquidity incentives via staking model, but it is very costly and short lasting. The better option is to rent it from an industry leader. Bigger projects (like yearn) buy CRV directly, which makes this very costly but at the same a long term solution, and also increases their treasury value. Others, if not most, use bribes model, where they pay big CRV holders (like Convex) so that they can direct this sweet liquidity toward their tokens.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>How much this liquidity is worth? I don&#39;t want to start digging right now, but I bet on a yearly $100m. Why? Because this is the missing income part that could explain current price equilibrium. This also makes sense, if you look at bribe services APR and their tokens APR, e.g. Convex cvxCRV gives 3.54% base APR + 26.4% from bribes. This value makes a lot of sense, as it is close to inflation value.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you add expected growth, I think CRV is undervalued. I have some doubts if this all will hold year after year with withering inflation rewards, but my educated guess is: <strong>yes, it will</strong>. Curve is providing a very good service that is needed in this space. Has great team and top-notch math behind its models (this why they have high vol/tvl ratio!). </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I hold around 1% of my portfolio in CRV.</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-15 00:13:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j4faquv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10cc78w","parent_id":"t1_j4f2abn","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Great addition to what I wrote.

For that dank math sauce to be secure, there needs to be at least 1 honest person participating in this ceremony, that can be you! You&#39;ll even get a POAP! All you need is a PC (not a phone sadly), a github account or Ethereum address and a lot of patience. Patience because a lot of people are trying to participate right now but only 1 gets to every 3 minutes or so.
