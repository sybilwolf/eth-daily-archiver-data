I think when I wrote this in 2021 I thought by just understanding the narrative and being early you will print. True is: narratives are important, but most likely (at least for me) only really relevant in a bull market. Or the other way around: Narratives are nice in bear market, but that doesn't mean they will safe you. E.g. There was a \"real yield\" season and GMX did hold pretty nicely, but it's probably an exception. Other narratives didn't help me at all. This leads to:\n3. **NEW: In a bear you gotta be patient (and buy ETH)**  \nNow this sounds crazy, but I really think this might be the biggest learning from the last 12 months. Fade narratives in bear market. Sell last cycles coins. All of them. Don't think they will recover, because even if they do, they will lose vs ETH and you can increase your holdings if you *really* want to double down. I kept two tokens and let me tell you I am not happy :)   \nBuy ETH whenever you feel like it (longterm it's most likely a good buy). But also with ETH, be patient, history maybe doesn't repeat but it rhymes. E.g. I bought the bottom at 800$, but I also made some more buys in the other crashes at e.g. 1750. Why? Because of \"FOMO\", being scared it could immediately pump - which it usually doesn't in a real bear market. There is capitulation in a crash and a time based capitulation. And YES! I know that I / we don't know. And maybe next cycle is different. Still I think understanding what patience means is important. \n4. **NEW: Make a bear an opportunity**  \nThis is kind of connected to the the old 6. \"Take profits\". I think that's still very important: having cash on the sidelines means a crash/ dip might even have a positive side, both for your portfolio but also (and maybe more important) emotionally.   \nBut I think I would go even further: I sold most of my alts in Feb 22. I felt I was late, didn't sell the top, bla bla. In hindsight I think that move wasn't bad at all. But I could have even shorted last cycles trash. Not in a day trading way, but as in shorting and forgetting the short. I was so impressed by some people (especially the Luna short from 100$ to 0 from that one guy that covered his short for 42cents in the end). I know I can't do that, I know he's probably one in a 1000, but I also think there is a valid way that includes shorting when you feel the bear has really arrived. \n5. **You can't predict crypto short term, NEW: you can predict crypto long term**  \nI am more convinced than ever that this is the case and I also think that doesn't really contradict anything I have said before :) But the more important part of this is: I am sure we can predict crypto long term. I'll probably write about this soon, but e.g. \"execution layers\" aka \"L2s\" are alpha. Modular blockchains are alpha. ETH as the one global settlement layer is alpha.

I was too bullish. I was hoping for 10k ETH, 100k BTC etc. etc. So I am planning profit taking now. I am trying to estimate valid prices to exit certain positions, e.g. by understanding what certain prices say about my tokens, I compare them to evaluations of last cycle (example: If OP reached 20$ that would mean 80B FDV which is close to SOLs mcap last cycle - and I think that's already bullish, even if it's just 10x, compared to SOLs 100x) and try to be more realistic and less emotional when it comes to taking profits. I think I was driven by greed and euphoria last cycle and will try to change this going into 2023 and 2024.\n\nI have some goals for the next 24-36 months and hope that reflecting on my learnings will help me to make stuff happen.
