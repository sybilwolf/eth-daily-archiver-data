We continue at our own risk.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Dvm1MMx\n\nEven with 'Warn on suspected scams' enabled, Revoke.cash does not take any action.\n\nThe button to connect a wallet does not work on this fraud site. Lets move on\n\n**SCAM #2**\n\nI used codefi.network's [phishing list](https://static.metafi.codefi.network/api/v1/lists/eth_phishing_detect_config.json) which is used by MetaMask, to search for more scams.\n\nOf course, MetaMask stops us from visiting the below domain, but we continue past.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/1eyCtJo\n\nThe domain is active, but sent what looks to be an empty response.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/jKfEVtq\n\n**SCAM #3**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/nrWU4Ud\n\nMetaMask warns against the above domain.\n\nI was sloppy by forgetting to screenshot every step. This website had me input my new address generated with MetaMask. After doing this, we were sent to the below page.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/tdbhlkl\n\nHahaha\n\n**SCAM #4**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gZhOk3a\n\nHere is a site imitating OpenSea.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/kHmmk3f\n\nThe sign in 'buttons' dont work. Inspecting the code, we see that they are simply small images inserted to imitate OpenSea. The only functioning thing on the website is the 'Download' button.\n\n'OpenSea.apk' - SHA256 hash - 41a63e5777360e5c61374da36ffb2aaf0a260c51dec03cc4295d8b0ec0897bc2\n\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/41a63e5777360e5c61374da36ffb2aaf0a260c51dec03cc4295d8b0ec0897bc2\n\nBeing an android package, it clearly targets android devices. Quite disturbing that this went undetected by Malwarebytes, as I use their app on my android device...\n\nTo extract files from the archive, we use the tool 'apktool'.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/6QkYILI\n\nThe command 'apktool d opensea.apk' tells opensea to decode opensea.apk\n\nThe files and directories extracted are listed further down in the image.\n\nThe file AndroidManifest.xml lists the permissions requested by android apps. The command 'strings AndroidManifest.xml | grep permssion' was used to view the permissions requested by this malicious OpenSea app.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/nbS16fG\n\nTo see more about the behavior of this app check out its reports from [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/41a63e5777360e5c61374da36ffb2aaf0a260c51dec03cc4295d8b0ec0897bc2), and [Joe Sandbox](https://www.joesandbox.com/search?q=41a63e5777360e5c61374da36ffb2aaf0a260c51dec03cc4295d8b0ec0897bc2)\n\n**SCAM #5**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/RowKhVk\n\nThis site attempting to impersonate Rocket Pool prompted MetaMask to connect.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BMRnbJe\n\nMetaMask connected to the site.\n\n\n\n**SCAM #6**\n\nHere we have a fake Aave website.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/iXLl4OJ\n\nAgain, MetaMask connects. I know, no transactions have been attempted. But I would *really* like revoke.cash to step in at some point.\n\n**SCAM #7**\n\nWatch out for this one! \n\nhttps://imgur.com/58vD6Tj\n\nWhen we click the sign in button, it doesnt just prompt MetaMask. It opens a new browser window shaped and styled to look like MetaMask! I had to move the fake window to the left to reveal the actual MetaMask extension on the right.\n\nI put my MetaMask password into the malicious window, and get redirected to a page masquerading as MetaMask's extension settings.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/d4t5POj\n\nI input my seed phrase, and a new password. I am then redirected to the genuine domain app.paraswap.io, seemingly as an attempt to appear legitimate.\n\n**SCAM #8**\n\nBelow is a website that masquerades as the blur.io NFT marketplace.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/0zPQbGd\n\nFinally! Revoke.cash warns us that this is a scam!\n\nI understand that revoke.cash's primary function is having to do with protecting against loose permissions and malicious contracts. I just dont understand the logic of 'let the user's wallet deal with phishing sites', when the extension claims to 'Warn on suspected scams'.\n\nDo they mean 'Warn on suspected scam *contracts only*'? Im really just trying to get a feel for what the extension does relative to the wording. \n\nIs the revoke.cash team just gigachading by realizing that any web2 domain can host any smart contract, and choosing to not use that as a metric?\n\nAnyway, I hope yall have a good one!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Come with me as we take a walk through cryptoscamland.

The modular blockchain thesis is something only \"we\" talk about. I was caught in my social bubble and made the mistake to assume what I know is public knowledge. L2s are not a hidden secret, don't get me wrong and with every cycle it will be harder to find \"good\" narratives, but that doesn't mean that a new narrative / meme will not surprise a huge part of the market, especially since (hopefully) more and more new people will be onboarded (and buy our bags). In other words: I don't think we will have a \"sell me all your OP/STARK/ZKS for 3$ and then FUCK OFF\" moment, at least not in the sense that someone will miss 100x after this happens, but if this narrative takes off I think valuations close to those of SOL/ AVAX last cycle will be possible... \n\nSo some numbers as a reference:\n\n* SOL mcap peak: 80B \n* LUNA mcap peak: 40B\n* AVAX mcap peak: 30B\n* ETH mcap peak in 2018: 120B\n\nSome more thoughts and questions: \n\n* What mcap do you expect ETH will reach the next cycle? \n* What percentage will successful L2s have?\n\nNow obviously L2 tokens will have a different supply so we can't just compare OP to SOL, and OP will not reach 250 USD (because max supply is more or less 10x). Obviously we also don't know if \"the new narrative\" is always just one cycle behind and will reach a similar market cap, but I guess making some assumptions here are fair and a good experiment. \n\nIf we take SOL as a reference (and obviously! you are free to take any other alt L1) execution layer tokens (if they start trading close to VC valuation of their parent companies, which probably depends on *when* in the cycle they are launched, the earlier the lower/ closer to valuation imo) could have make something between 10x and 20x next cycle.

I'm a big proponent of it.\n\nAnd I'm sorry to hear about all the negative consequences it's had for you. Realizing that and taking therapy, that's a commendable step!\n\nAs to your question, I think my answer is twofold, when I think about it.\n\nOn the one hand, \"money\" could simply solve some of the issues in my life currently. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a more complicated aspect that I've experience for the first time now that I'm around 30. In short, I feel privileged with my life: love my job as a teacher, have a partner that I enjoy daily, and since 5 weeks even a baby daughter. We've even found a place to live in our \"expensive\" city.\n\nMoney-wise, I've noticed that I seem very prone to upwards comparisons. That is, even though I know many, many people are worse off than me, I only seem to compare myself with those who live in fancier apartments, have newer sports equipment, etc.\n\nThe funny thing: I qualified for a few airdrops last bull run, which was nice and allowed me to increase my own conservative stack to 2-3 ETH which I'm holding now. And, ironically, receiving this \"free money\" only made the upwards comparison worse!\n\nSo, on the one hand I love \"adult life\", with a monthly salary and stability. And I love this daily and the Ethereum ecosystem, with interesting developments and, behold, free money sometimes.\n\nBut I've also noticed a change in myself, from a student who had little money and donated lots, to a 30-year-old who somehow feels like he's \"at the bottom of a ladder\" while, objectively, he already has a very privileged life.\n\nFor fun, check out the simpleliving subreddit.
