It's not especially difficult to answer with the chain and MEV data (but no one seems to have made this available AFAIK), although future projection will be difficult. As others have pointed out, time frame is an important consideration but there is more to it because (MEV) reward distribution is highly skewed. You may receive a fairly stable mean or median under some number of validators, over some time frame, but for higher percentiles (higher value MEV rewards), will be much more erratic (due to the small, but not irrelevant, probability of receiving a disproportionately large reward). It gets more complicated because the distribution is not stationary in time due to various factors. With consistently low network activity, you might get a fairly stable return with 10 validators since MEV accounts for only a small proportion of total returns. However, this would become unstable with much increased and erratic network activity.\n\nAt a guess, right now, for decently averaged annual returns (such that you've got a decent chance of a few big blocks), my guess is you'd need 50+ validators (e.g. ~200 blocks per year).
