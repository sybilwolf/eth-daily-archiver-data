For example there could be exclusive ticket sale rounds to whitelisted addresses based on previous event attendance.\n\nAdditionally there are trust and corruption issues with current ticketing approaches such as corrupt release mechanisms and opaque service charge fees. At the very least having the sale logic on the blockchain can add transparency and equal access to the process.

Alternatively more market-like initial auction systems have been demonstrated by newer tokens like Gearbox which used [0xCider](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-31-1-gear-strategy-cider-ed-liquidity/2050/87).

It's how they were able to grow to their current size: they stopped treating the attendee as the customer. There is a market opportunity here to reduce Ticketmaster's cut of the fees though.

This is where things like Rarible's multi-chain protocol would really shine as it is fully indexed and is made to allow numerous frontends, dial their own parameters, and for people to pick whatever chain they want.\n\nFinally, unlike a normal ticket stub or plain digital record an NFT ticket can be associated with extra metadata (even after the event). A system like Ticketmaster could add some type of history system so you can view a collection of your previous events and event highlight reels for each but they haven't in 20 years. By contrast, this is much more normal for NFTs already. Integrate this into a digital picture frame and you can have a place on superfan's wall that cycles through highlights of the favorite games they've attended or that lets them build a digital gallery in something like Decentraland and compete with other fans.\n\nSo, there's an opportunity here to improve the status quo for venues, performers, and attendees and the only one who stands to lose is a generally reviled middleman.

Then again, my kid complains that RDR2 has video issues on his windows machine, so idk. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d rather not play a bunch of games than have to worry about windows update or having to constantly re-install the printer that one time a month when I need to print something.</p>\n\n<p>YMMV</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-22 11:22:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5g0z55","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10icjgc","parent_id":"t1_j5fz08u","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/REALJohnBMacLemore","body":"A lot but not all\n\nhttps://www.protondb.com","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A lot but not all</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.protondb.com\">https://www.protondb.com</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-22 12:30:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5gbm3i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10icjgc","parent_id":"t1_j5fz08u","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"Probably a highly Unpopular opinion: If being the second highest market cap coin is a thing that keeps Ethereum grinding hard to be the best then I'm all for remaining the second coin.

Basically dApps will  receive a portion of the gas spent when users interact with the contract. It is an interesting idea that I&#39;m surprised other alternative smart contract chains never did before. Below is a portion of the proposal that passed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This proposal seeks to reduce the current burn rate 46 from 20% to 5%, and redirect 15% of transaction fees to the creation of Affiliate Rewards.</p>\n\n<p>How do we reward the high-quality creators on Fantom in a sustainable way using Affiliate Rewards?</p>\n\n<p>We take what works in web2 and restructure it to fit the network\u2019s priorities, which means taking the ad monetisation model and extending it to gas monetisation for performing dApps that manage to attract a steady stream of users.</p>\n\n<p>This would be accomplished by splitting the gas fees paid to the network with the builder, at the proposed rate of 15%. Please note that this is subject to change and could increase/decrease in the future through a separate governance vote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.fantom.network/t/dapp-affiliate-rewards-discussion/132\">https://forum.fantom.network/t/dapp-affiliate-rewards-discussion/132</a></p>\n\n<p>I have a dust amount of FTM but nonetheless I&#39;m excited to see what happens with this.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-22 09:36:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5fkdce","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10icjgc","parent_id":"t3_10icjgc","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CosmicCollusion","body":"Wasn't it also one of EVMOS' shelling points too?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wasn&#39;t it also one of EVMOS&#39; shelling points too?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-22 10:18:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5fquqc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10icjgc","parent_id":"t1_j5fkdce","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Revanchist1","body":"Oh wow, I kind of ignored EVMOS.

They will never understand what they have become.</p>\n\n<p>These people would rather snuff out your light than discover their own. Because they lack light, they can not see clearly, and so they find false happiness in destroying you. These people are only trying to be freed from their own insecurities, but you know happiness, and that is not it. </p>\n\n<p>Do not mistake their success for liberation. It is only a facade, a lie told for their own exculpation, and the only ones listening are their own kind. Beware, these people will often refer to themselves as a fighter or survivor. They will often believe that their deity condones their actions, and because of that they are entitled to win. They can not see that their deity is trying to free them, to release their soul from their prison.</p>\n\n<p>John, you are not like them. You were not meant to live in hell and follow them. No, you are bound for something greater. You were born to show them the way. You have been given a gift, the ability to see the truth. You were put here to lead them to their light so they may see the way for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Despite their seemingly endless numbers, you are not alone. I and countless others of both the living and spirit, in this time and all times before and after, stand with you. We are your courage, we are your strength.</p>\n\n<p>Love,<br/>\nJBM</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-22 07:03:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5ey9v8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10icjgc","parent_id":"t3_10icjgc","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/imagranny","body":"Be true to yourself.
