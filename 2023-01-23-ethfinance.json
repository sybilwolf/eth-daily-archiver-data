It does exactly what it needs to do: Calculate carbon emission and retire the calculated amount of carbon credits on chain in one transaction. I still think it is pretty amazing that this can be done on a blockchain. The tool is in a rough state as we built it within a few weeks last summer to familiarize ourselves with the money legos in the carbon space which we then used to build the much more polished offsetting tool for Devcon in Bogota. I should backport quite a few things to make the flight offsetter more user friendly. \n\nOne big disadvantage at the moment is the default offset project is now a forest preservation project in China. I am not expecting this forest preservation project to be an outright scam, but I would feel more at ease if a project with a more widely accepted set of requirements would be used. That means we will have to change the smart contract which allows a different forest preservation project to retire credits from. This will take some time, but work on it started.  \n\nShameless plug: If you like these kind of projects, please consider donating for the gitcoin alpha climate solution round were our project (discarbon) is in the carbon markets bundle: https://grant-explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/1/0x1b165fe4da6bc58ab8370ddc763d367d29f50ef0/0xd716c3a7c353f0458ff8387fb435606934e25b631a83db017e5eb9a0022358f0-0x1b165fe4da6bc58ab8370ddc763d367d29f50ef0","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Congratulations on the scholarship, I was a bit worried when I saw you got laid off.

While there's certainly some economics at play here I think the real driver of adoption for this model was the undeniable convenience of digital storage and delivery. The ability to watch whatever you want, when you want, without commercials is a powerful selling point in a culture dominated by convenience.\n\nHowever, there are a few sticking points with that model for consumers:\n\n1) Content you like can disappear at any time.\n\n2) They can revoke your account at any time and you lose access to everything you've purchased. You own nothing.\n\n3) They are cracking down on password sharing and you can't share the content itself through other means.\n\nMost people are perfectly happy with this tradeoff. If content is removed, they'll be annoyed but just find something else, bans are infrequent so far, and sharing crackdowns have only just started. That said, I do think there is some latent demand for content ownership in the digital age that hasn't been served due to a combination of legal and technical issues.\n\nOn the legal side I have heard that there are concerns that if a distributor does just about anything to assist with the resale of content the SEC wants to make it a security. While I would find it amusing to watch the SEC argue that a My Little Pony DVD is a security the distributors just don't want the fight. I can't otherwise speak to the point. It's secondhand knowledge and I'm not a lawyer.\n\nOn the technical side though, blockchains do offer some assistance. Content can be stored on a decentralized data availability layer cheaply enough to be viable. Filecoin and IPFS aren't even the best examples. I think we'll see the rise of an EigenLayer DA protocol that the caller can specify the data redundancy requirements for to dial in the cost to their needs. On this decentralized network storage medium the content can be stored in an encrypted form. The decryption key can be the output of a view function on chain that only works if the address making the call is whitelisted and a signature from that address is provided as a parameter. This forms the backbone of a data license. If the whitelist mechanism is hooked up to an NFT, then you have a transferrable data license. This would facilitate the resale of content without the likes of Gamestop taking like a 90% cut and would provide a new revenue stream to content creators. If the data license has time constraints, then you have an expiring data license. This facilitates rental content. These are capabilities I think consumers want that the industry has struggled to provide.\n\nCombine the above with a sign in with Ethereum layer, and your Ethereum address can be the host of your entire media library. A swipe from your phone can unlock content on any device you pair with just by sending it a signed message it can use to fetch the decryption key. The addressable market just for video game sales is larger than the entire NFT market to date. Steam made [$6.4B](https://vginsights.com/steam-market-data) in gross revenue just from game sales in 2021. Given their 30% cut, that implies $21B in sales. Digital books are another [~$1B](https://wordsrated.com/ebooks-sales-statistics/). I can't get isolated data for how much Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Hulu, etc  make on movie sales/rentals but physical DVD/Blue-Ray sales are another $2B so I imagine it's more than that.
