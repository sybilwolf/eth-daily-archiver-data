It's really cool if you picked up on this without knowing about it. There IS a mechanism that dissuades centralized staking, specifically through the slashing mechanism. It's called a correlated slashing penalty and it says that multiple validators who are slashed in a similar period will incur a higher slashing penalty, up to 32 Ether.

So dsETH enables diversification by avoiding concentration.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-25 09:05:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5ucpy9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10jyo68","parent_id":"t1_j5qvu39","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/nitter_not_twitter","body":"[https://nitter.snopyta.org/indexcoop/status/1617932168428421121?t=9z1IxDxxzqwG-AAnuKMiAw&s=19](https://nitter.snopyta.org/indexcoop/status/1617932168428421121?t=9z1IxDxxzqwG-AAnuKMiAw&s=19)  \n\n ^(I'm a bot | )[^(Why & About)](https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&subject=Opt+Out&message=optout)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/indexcoop/status/1617932168428421121?t=9z1IxDxxzqwG-AAnuKMiAw&amp;s=19\">https://nitter.snopyta.org/indexcoop/status/1617932168428421121?t=9z1IxDxxzqwG-AAnuKMiAw&amp;s=19</a>  </p>\n\n<p><sup>I&#39;m a bot | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/\"><sup>Why &amp; About</sup></a><sup> | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&amp;subject=Opt+Out&amp;message=optout\"><sup>Opt Out</sup></a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-24 14:27:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5qs87g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10jyo68","parent_id":"t1_j5qs75f","score":0,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/BakedEnt","body":"Rocket Pool","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Rocket Pool</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-23 23:44:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5nnxer","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10jyo68","parent_id":"t3_10jyo68","score":31,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Seems to be working out for me.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Seems to be working out for me.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-24 00:04:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5nphi7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10jyo68","parent_id":"t1_j5nnxer","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/aaj094","body":"Lets look at what game theory would suggest about the fate of Bitcoin.

These things create a flywheel that will easily trump minor differences in supply issuance. It is possible that proof of work forces miners to sell more issuance and creates a wider distribution of tokens than proof of stake, feeding into that flywheel more effectively over time.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I don&#39;t think that is a given by any means. POS also has big advantages with lower barriers to entry and more numerous viable use cases that will attract more users.</p>\n\n<p>Something I saw quite some time ago that I think is still very relevant today. Bitcoin (POW) is the wartime blockchain. Ethereum (POS) is the peacetime blockchain. If nation states declare war on blockchains, Bitcoin will have an easier time surviving/thriving.

There's a growing market of games that are free-to-play or subscription based where ownership of the game is a legacy concept. Instead these games monetize lootboxes, trading cards, tournaments, and subscription items.\n\nI think there's a misconception that games need to jump into blockchains with both feet or be designed from the ground up to be blockchain native. The absolute minimum a game needs to do add blockchain support is take a single in-game item, usually something like gold or a subscription item, and create a bridge to and from their database to a blockchain. You add a rest api that mints the item on the blockchain and deletes it from their database after some confirmations and which subscribes to the chain for a certain event and burns the NFT and adds it to their database. This is about a 5 day project for an intern. I've built one personally.\n\nWhat you get as a game studio for this tiny integration is a monetary pathway from your company to your customer. That opens *massive* possibilities. Your usual Visa integration is a one-way valve. The alternative of having the customer link a bank account somehow is relatively terrifying from a GDPR perspective and rife with jurisdictional issues. A simple bridge to a blockchain outsources all the complexity and legal issues of any subsequent uses of bridged items such as secondary exchanges and any integration with the banking system. It also kills the typical black market that appears for any game for anything that is tradable. I used to trade gold on Ebay back in the days of Ultima Online. There was a huge friction point in the exchange not being atomic and in using Ebays dispute resolution system. People would get burned on both sides and a lot of value leaked to Ebay from buyers that could have stayed in the ecosystem and helped support the game somehow.\n\nRight now MagicEden seems to have the lead here. Their Eden Games page showcases not just the NFTs, but the surrounding game they accompany. The experience resembles a Steam storefront with videos, a link to the game, and context about who created it and a description of the game. I could easily see them adding game reviews and community pages like Steam has as well. The NFT sale experience takes a backseat to a discovery experience here.\n\nIn terms of addressable market cap, loot boxes alone account for [$15B in sales](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-boxes-to-generate-usd20bn-by-2025) in 2020. Subscription fees for XBoxLive, PlayStation, and Nintendo are about $5B. Various other MMOs have another 10M subscribers with WoW being the largest player still in an increasingly fragmented space. Magic the Gathering Online makes over a $1B selling cards. Hearthstone is another $500M. There's plenty of money here for any of the big names to take that first plunge and make waves.\n\nWhat I don't think will succeed is this Metaverse concept I've seen discussed where some game item from one game is going to be importable to some other game. From a game designer perspective there's just no reason to do this other than maybe for some cosmetic items as some kind of marketing play. NFT collections like [Loot](https://lootnft.io/) always struck me as a hype bubble but maybe I'm just missing something.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m going to define Gamefi as ownership and financialization of in-game items and separate from owning a copy of the game itself which I wrote about <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10j5dkj/daily_general_discussion_january_23_2023/j5iqxqz/\">yesterday</a>.

A simple bridge to a blockchain outsources all the complexity and legal issues of any subsequent uses of bridged items such as secondary exchanges and any integration with the banking system. It also kills the typical black market that appears for any game for anything that is tradable. I used to trade gold on Ebay back in the days of Ultima Online. There was a huge friction point in the exchange not being atomic and in using Ebays dispute resolution system. People would get burned on both sides and a lot of value leaked to Ebay from buyers that could have stayed in the ecosystem and helped support the game somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Right now MagicEden seems to have the lead here. Their Eden Games page showcases not just the NFTs, but the surrounding game they accompany. The experience resembles a Steam storefront with videos, a link to the game, and context about who created it and a description of the game. I could easily see them adding game reviews and community pages like Steam has as well. The NFT sale experience takes a backseat to a discovery experience here.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of addressable market cap, loot boxes alone account for <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-boxes-to-generate-usd20bn-by-2025\">$15B in sales</a> in 2020. Subscription fees for XBoxLive, PlayStation, and Nintendo are about $5B. Various other MMOs have another 10M subscribers with WoW being the largest player still in an increasingly fragmented space. Magic the Gathering Online makes over a $1B selling cards. Hearthstone is another $500M. There&#39;s plenty of money here for any of the big names to take that first plunge and make waves.</p>\n\n<p>What I don&#39;t think will succeed is this Metaverse concept I&#39;ve seen discussed where some game item from one game is going to be importable to some other game. From a game designer perspective there&#39;s just no reason to do this other than maybe for some cosmetic items as some kind of marketing play. NFT collections like <a href=\"https://lootnft.io/\">Loot</a> always struck me as a hype bubble but maybe I&#39;m just missing something.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-24 00:03:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5npe42","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10jyo68","parent_id":"t3_10jyo68","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Naelex","body":"Doesn't that ability to delete the NFT and recentralise it mean it loses immutability.
