My inital intent was to remove this campaign from the internet.\n\nThough, as my investigation progressed, I became more and more conscious of the CFAA. I would not discourage anyone who understands the implications from picking up where I left off.\n\n**The Scam**\n\nLoading the domain in your browser will instantly prompt MetaMask to connect. Doing so leads to a fake DEX. You are given a 6 digit \u2018ID\u2019 that is displayed on the front page. Below is an example of one of their scam pages.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Wy5NPSb\n\nThis is all over the place. USDT-ERC20, output in ETC. They provide various addresses to deposit your funds. At least one of the addresses provided does not even have an ETH balance \u2013 without any gas money, these fraudsters were never planning to return any deposits.\n\nI clicked on the button that was a head with headphones, presumably the support button.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/s2V6PAW\n\nYou can \u2018Emall\u2019 them at the displayed email address. Visiting the above domain in chrome showed the exact same front end as the scam we\u2019re dealing with.\n\nFrighteningly, they want you to \u2018authenticate\u2019.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/B9nXvHN\n\nThey ask for your name and email address. Infinitely worse, they want pictures of any forms of your identification, as can be seen below.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/iJpMGIj\n\nAnyone who has completed this form should consider their identity stolen, and contact the appropriate authorities.\n\n**Offense**\n\nTo begin to gain some understanding of a website, using \u2018view page source\u2019 in your browser is an extremely effective tool.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/8q39ows\n\nThe highlighted text is Simplified Chinese for \u2018page loaded\u2019. *Quite* interesting.\n\nAs an attacker, this file upload form offers a massive attack surface. Of course, an experienced intruder knows what to do here.\n\nBut for any ethfinanciers who would like to learn more about this, here are some resources [1](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload)[2](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)[3](https://www.aptive.co.uk/blog/unrestricted-file-upload-testing/) or just ask ya boi.\n\nWhen running a [black box](https://brightsec.com/blog/black-box-penetration-testing/) web application security test, /robots.txt is a critical file to access. This file is used by servers to request that web crawlers such as google not access/archive the list of URLs within the file.\n\nAs you might imagine, these often times contain URLs of relative importance. Whether crawlers choose to obey is completely up to them both technically, and legally(not legal advice).\n\nThe requested /robots.txt did not directly return any confidential files or directories. Though, it resulted in a fairly signficant information leak.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/eJwEEWq\n\nI unfortunately did not think to translate that Chinese text to English. Do we have any Chinese speaking ethfinanciers who can help out?\n\nNotice that this error leaks a number of file paths on this server.\n\nAt the bottom we see that the server uses ThinkPHP 3.2.0, which happens to be vulnerable to a high severity issue.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/3l8C9Tf\n\nI will not fix the URL provided in the description to fit this target simply for the safety of those who do not know exactly what they\u2019re doing. Be very careful before landing yourself in federal prison.\n\nWhen learning to attack a system, one thing that has to be reinforced is the idea of enumeration. I cannot find a link to an article that accurately articulates what I wish to convey. I would describe it is as the art of testing ideas, taking notes of oddities, and learning everything you can about your target system.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. Screenshots were not taken, but I found that files requested that lack the the extension \u2018.php\u2019 resulted in the same error shown in /robots.txt. Is it a vulnerability? No. Is it worth noting if you wish to gain a thorough understanding of your target? Yes.\n\nI've seen *lots* of examples of security researchers bringing down scam websites without facing prosecution, but a number of things made me hesitant in this case.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/0j1UzE0\n\nThe true ip address of the scammers is protected by Cloudflare. Finding the ip address of servers behind Cloudflare is an eternal challenge for attackers.\n\nhttps://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/how-to-bypass-cloudflare/ seems to be extremely comprehensive and up to date. I tried every technqiue short of signing up for a service that requires an API key. No results, the following provides a fair explanation for that.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/iK54QDk\n\nAs /u/REALJohnBMacLemore previously noted, the website was only created a few months ago. Thats always suspicious. What about the domain listed as the support email address?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/4xC20qD\n\nThis domain is hosted by Alibaba US. That they dont even provide an abuse contact speaks volumes.\n\nIn my brief enumeration efforts, I visisted /index.php, which redirected me to /Pc/Index/index.html.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/DDUUiAQ\n\nThe HTML does not render properly, but this is completely different than what we were dealing with before.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/wk227MG\n\nAt the bottom of the page we see another support email address. The highlighted text seems to show that the listed website(NOTE: not the scam domain in question) might have been a real company at some point? The registration number certainly does not comply with the new Chinese business registration numbering system, which was in full effect by 2018.\n\nLets use whois.domaintools.com again to find some information about this newly discovered forex exchange domain.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/2o6PP1v\n\nThe domain name has been used for at least 16 years.\n\nThis scam seems to be masquerading as a possibly real, but defunct Chinese forex exchange. Also doubling as a crypto exchange, depending on their target.\n\n[Attribution](https://www.exabeam.com/incident-response/cyber-attribution-essential-component-of-incident-response-or-optional-extra/) has always been a touchy subject in the realm of cyber security, with that type of debate usually reserved for large-scale nation state attacks.\n\nWhen we consider the prevalent usage of the Simplified Chinese language, a Chinese PHP framework, and Alibaba hosting, Im confident in declaring this a campaign of Chinese origin. Of course, given the lack of sophistication on the part of the scammers, and the lack of geopolitical implications, this is virtually meaningless.\n\nStay safe, RTPP","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Today we will be investigating the scam that took advantage of our friend who came here looking for help yesterday.

Why not try to widen the range, which in turn would add to the 'educational' aspect (as we would discover new projects that way); our curiosity and interest level would be higher during ad breaks and we may be less tempted to skip them.\n* Don't start every episode with a block of ads within the first 5 mins. It really kills the momentum and reduces engagement with the topic\n* Don't rely solely on David reading out the ads; and ideally, don't involve the hosts in the ad content at all. It *greatly* diminishes any impression of plausible non-bias for the hosts. We'd all be better served by having hosts which are curious, intelligent and impartial, with at least one layer of distance from the many advertised projects. The current approach also leaves the hosts very open to having personally endorsed products which, in future, may not all be ones you want that for (but we'll only know which ones with hindsight).\n* Dial down the \"everything is amazing\" vibe in the ads. It really grates. The worst current example is the Uniswap ad that David reads... the \"*but-DID-YOU-KNOW-that??\"* part is kind of lowest-denominator advertising. It treats the listener like they're dumb; and it's likely that bankless listeners generally do already know this about Uniswap. Treat your audience like they're smart, please! This is compounded further when we have to hear the same ads every single episode.\n\n**Sort out the volume balancing**\n\n* David's mic is often painfully loud compared to Ryan's (and also compared to the guests). It often peaks/distorts. At the level the podcast has reached, we should have all speakers really nicely balanced in terms of volume.\n\nHopefully you'll take this feedback as it's intended, which is that it's only given to help make the show better.

I&#39;ve been working on onboarding my podcast team to take livestreaming duties from me, so I can focus on content (did you know I&#39;m the one who manages the livestreaming while also doing the interview), and then both ryan and my microphones will have the same treatment.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-26 06:22:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5ypx06","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10lkzyb","parent_id":"t1_j5y25qe","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/proof-of-lake","body":"Hey David, cheers for the reply. A few quick thoughts/comments based on what you've said:\n\n* You responded to my suggestion about not having a large chunk of ads at the very start of the pod by simply explaining that ads are important in terms of allowing Bankless to exist and do its thing. I hadn't ever disputed that - my point was solely about the choices that you and the team make about *when* ad breaks appear (and how long they run for). I know in my case that more frequent, much shorter ad breaks - once the episode was really rolling (and possibly with more variety) - would guarantee that I'd listen to them rather than wanting to skip them.\n* You suggested that if I don't like the ads, I can go premium. This is true, and I have been a premium member in the past. However, it seems like the \\*ideal\\* world for Bankless would be one in which *no one* is deeply annoyed by the ads, and where people choose the premium version not to avoid being annoyed, but because it's irresistibly filled with great additional content and perks. Wouldn't this be a better approach? I'm just trying to think about how the show can be a better product for everyone (as I suspect that a majority of people do still listen to the free version).\n* Kudos for owning the ads like that. This really does mean that they are endorsements, which I didn't realise was the case. It sounds like we just have different takes on how ads interact with the show's overall presentation of itself and how they should 'feel'.\n* Your comment re: \"in the time it took you to write this post, you could have skipped the ads on 10 podcasts\" struck me as strange, given that my goal in writing the post was not to save time, but to hopefully help you guys get some feedback for possible changes! My post has gotten a decent number of upvotes, so I'm not the only listener with some of these views. I know that the ethfinance crowd is possibly not your primary audience these days, but we are still a pretty valuable sub-set of your listener base. So hopefully our views can be considered.\n* Re the mic volume; I see that a couple of community members here have suggested what sound like simple(ish?) fixes that could be tried in the post-production phase, which may help for the podcast versions.\n\nCheers and keep up the good work!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey David, cheers for the reply.
