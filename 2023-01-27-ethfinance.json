The ports are all closed off by default. Now imagine that you have a battery in the house that you want to discharge. You connect it to one of the ports and open it up on the outside of the house. Now someone who walks by can put a plug in the socket and charge something.\n\nThe ip address is the address of the house. The battery is a service, like SSH, a webserver, or an ethereum node. The electrical sockets are your ports.\n\nEvery ip address has roughly 65000 ports that it can \u2018listen\u2019 on. Once a service starts on a computer, it can bind to one of those ports and open it so that other people can connect to it.\n\nSome services have default ports, published by IANA. For example: http is port 80, https is port 443 and ssh is port 22. Other services have no default and just use a random free port.\n\nNow, this doesn\u2019t mean those ports *have* to be used. You can just as well run a webserver on port 1337. However, you would have to explicitly tell the browser to connect to that port, instead of the default port.\n\nA firewall is an extra layer before those ports. Imagine the house with sockets has an extra wall build in front of it, with again, 65k ports. The other side of this wall though, would have 65k plugs.\n\nNow, your house can not be trusted and batteries (services) just start and open various ports on the outside of the house. However, because the firewall is there, people can not just plug stuff in. You use the firewall to actually manage what ports you want open. \n\nFor example: Say you connect a battery to port 80 in the house. Now you want to open it in the firewall. You can just connect plug 80 from the firewall to port 80 on the house. That would open port 80 on your address. However, if you\u2019d so choose, you could also connect firewall plug 1337 to socket 80 on your house. That would open port 1337 on the firewall and redirect the traffic to port 80 on your house.\n\nWith regards to udp/tcp. These are both protocols which define what traffic should look like, hoe to route it and how to respond to it. Traffic is send in packets that are just a bunch of 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s. The internet protocols will specify what each bit in the package means. It also specifies what the other side should do once it receives a certain package. \n\nBasically:\n\nTCP is very error resistance. The connection starts with a handshake. Every packet gets verified and acknowledged before the next package gets sent. If a package gets damaged, the package will be sent again. This ensures that you always get correct data and is necessary for sending images, videos etc. over the internet.\n\nUDP is lossy. It\u2019s just a stream of packages where the sender doesn\u2019t really care if the receiver gets the package. Lost packages are just gone. The advantage of this is that it\u2019s much faster than TCP. Because it does not have to verify and resend all the time. This is more of use for data that has a short lifespan. It is often used in gaming to transmit player positions. It doesn\u2019t matter if some packages gets lost, because the next package with the new player position is being sent anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s not the best analogy, but it\u2019s late and im on mobile. It also greatly simplified. But I hope it helps anyway..","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I don\u2019t know why Prysm had a different port than the others, but I suspect there isn\u2019t really a reason.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to ports:</p>\n\n<p>Imagine that every house would have numbered ports (or electrical sockets) next to do their front door.
