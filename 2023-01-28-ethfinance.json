A HARDY BOYS MYSTERY IN 2023 ------  EXTREMELY ANOMALOUS CHAIN OF EVENTS REGARDING COINBASE AND ONLINE BANKING SECURITY\n\nCalling rooftop and other friends would appreciate getting a few different brains on this very strange chain of events that has taken place that I don't have the technical or security expertise to understand what is going on. Note: I use(d) the same Yubikey for three logins - email, one online bank, and Coinbase.\n\n1. Yesterday I try to log in to my online banking through Brave browser for which I have Yubikey 2FA. The prompt to touch the Yubikey \"looks\" different. Instead of just a pop up box prompting me to touch the Yubikey (after which it logs me in and loads the online dashboard), there is a pop up box that says PIN where I can type into, but also populates with hidden characters once I touch the Yubikey. Regardless, the login attempt does not work, and after three attempts I have the following in the pop up box: *Your security key is locked because the wrong PIN was entered too many times.*\n2. 9:00 AM This morning I receive an email from Coinbase saying ...*Thanks for letting Coinbase Support know about your device authorization issue. We'll be in contact with you as soon as possible...*\n3. 9:04 AM I receive a call with an American English accent from a Los Angeles phone number claiming to be from Coinbase and saying they have detected unusual activity on my account and that there is an attempt to change the email address on file from [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) to [x@protonmail.com](mailto:x@protonmail.com) as well as an attempt to send .25 BTC from the account. He says, \"ok they will put a hold on my Coinbase account and not authorize this send for .25 BTC\". I ask, \"how do I know you are calling from Coinbase?\" and they say you can check your email at which point I jump out of bed and indeed find the email at 9:00 AM described above. In the midst of a discussion with this person in which I am inquiring and cannot wrap my head around how my 2FA Yubikey with Coinbase was compromised, the call disconnects. I can't connect when I call the number back.\n4. I frantically search for and call the Coinbase support number and long story short, I am told Coinbase will never call anyone (which I \"knew\") and they told me my account is now locked pending the security team to reach out to reinstate it. Ironically enough this call also disconnects but the same agent calls me back. Upon my inquiry, she tells me that Coinbase does not have a call center in Los Angeles, that there have been no attempts to log in to my account since yesterday (which was by me), that no attempt has been made to change the email address on file, and that no attempt was made to send BTC. My Coinbase account is now locked, though I need to call back and check what minute it was locked to see if it was my security call to Coinbase that locked it or weird activity detected by Coinbase in the minutes prior.\n5. After that call, I now rush to my online banking. I'm still getting the weird new pop up box in Brave browser, the one with the \"PIN\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in it that populates with hidden characters when I touch the Yubikey. It still doesn't work and again says inccorect PIN.\n6. I frantically call my online banking customer support and at the same time try to log into my online bank through Firefox. The Firefox login works with Yubikey works while I am waiting to connect to a banking agent. Additionally the agent tells me that no unusual activity or log ins have been detected on my account.\n7. Finally, I decide to check the last account I use my Yubikey on - my Gmail. No unusual logins or sessions, just one on my laptop and one on my cellphone.\n\nThere are sooooo many questions here but I need you guys' help.\n\nHere's what I think I know, *someone* tried to do *something* which triggered the *Thanks for letting Coinbase Support know about your device authorization issue.* But what did they do? Remember I have 2FA on my Coinbase account. Four minutes later, someone calls? Who called? Was it Coinbase? If not, it was the hacker, but what did they want to accomplish by posing as a Coinbase agent trying to secure my account? The conversation got cut off but they did not capitalize on my frantic mood to immediately ask for sensitive information. Also, what sensitive information could they possible have wanted?\n\nWhy had the Yubikey 2FA prompt on my Brave browser visually changed? Why is it no longer working but it works fine on Firefox. Even now it's not working on Brave but works fine on Firefox.\n\nAre the events above regarding Coinbase and the weird Brave/Yubikey/OnlineBanking glitch related???\n\nLastly, I need to call Coinbase back and see what exact minute my account was locked because I'm curious if it was before I called in or *while I was calling in* and pressed the button to lock my account (which I did) as I was on the telephone steps waiting to connect to an agent. If the account was locked by my doing, then it seems nothing was actually compromised here.\n\nI am so confused, bemused, puzzled, curious and distressed since I thought all my security practices were as beefy as possible.\n\nEdit: I'm asking for help here to figure out what happened.\n\nEdit: I also want to add, the Firefox prompt for Yubikey 2FA on my online banking which worked resembles (but I cannot be sure if it's identical to) the prompt pop up box that Brave *used to* look like prior to yesterday.\n\nEdit: The email from Coinbase at 9AM is legit, [help@coinbase.com](mailto:help@coinbase.com).\n\nEdit: Reinstalled Brave and the Yubikey is still not working when I attempt to use online banking. It still says it's \"locked\".","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>HACKED ????

My Coinbase account is now locked, though I need to call back and check what minute it was locked to see if it was my security call to Coinbase that locked it or weird activity detected by Coinbase in the minutes prior.</li>\n<li>After that call, I now rush to my online banking. I&#39;m still getting the weird new pop up box in Brave browser, the one with the &quot;PIN_____________________&quot; in it that populates with hidden characters when I touch the Yubikey. It still doesn&#39;t work and again says inccorect PIN.</li>\n<li>I frantically call my online banking customer support and at the same time try to log into my online bank through Firefox. The Firefox login works with Yubikey works while I am waiting to connect to a banking agent. Additionally the agent tells me that no unusual activity or log ins have been detected on my account.</li>\n<li>Finally, I decide to check the last account I use my Yubikey on - my Gmail. No unusual logins or sessions, just one on my laptop and one on my cellphone.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are sooooo many questions here but I need you guys&#39; help.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s what I think I know, <em>someone</em> tried to do <em>something</em> which triggered the <em>Thanks for letting Coinbase Support know about your device authorization issue.</em> But what did they do? Remember I have 2FA on my Coinbase account. Four minutes later, someone calls? Who called? Was it Coinbase? If not, it was the hacker, but what did they want to accomplish by posing as a Coinbase agent trying to secure my account? The conversation got cut off but they did not capitalize on my frantic mood to immediately ask for sensitive information. Also, what sensitive information could they possible have wanted?</p>\n\n<p>Why had the Yubikey 2FA prompt on my Brave browser visually changed? Why is it no longer working but it works fine on Firefox. Even now it&#39;s not working on Brave but works fine on Firefox.</p>\n\n<p>Are the events above regarding Coinbase and the weird Brave/Yubikey/OnlineBanking glitch related???</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I need to call Coinbase back and see what exact minute my account was locked because I&#39;m curious if it was before I called in or <em>while I was calling in</em> and pressed the button to lock my account (which I did) as I was on the telephone steps waiting to connect to an agent. If the account was locked by my doing, then it seems nothing was actually compromised here.</p>\n\n<p>I am so confused, bemused, puzzled, curious and distressed since I thought all my security practices were as beefy as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I&#39;m asking for help here to figure out what happened.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I also want to add, the Firefox prompt for Yubikey 2FA on my online banking which worked resembles (but I cannot be sure if it&#39;s identical to) the prompt pop up box that Brave <em>used to</em> look like prior to yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The email from Coinbase at 9AM is legit, [<a href=\"mailto:help@coinbase.com\">help@coinbase.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:help@coinbase.com\">help@coinbase.com</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Reinstalled Brave and the Yubikey is still not working when I attempt to use online banking.
