This is my unofficial staking hardware guide for 2023.\n\nI am a long-time Ethereum person that planned to stake with Coinbase initially and later move to my own hardware either partially or fully. I am now preparing to migrate to my own gear. I find that I don't totally agree with the general solo staker community on some things. I'm going to generalize a bit, so please don't crucify me.\n\nIf you disagree with anything, let's discuss it!\n\nAlso, I don't really mention rocket pool, but this is all pretty much applicable whether or not you use rocket pool.\n\n**Chapter 1, Internet:**\n\nThe Ethereum solo staking community just loves running validators on their normal residential home internet connection. I've also seen people using (or interested in using) Starlink, or cellular home internet 4G/5G options. It's a bit insane to me.\n\nMost people seem to be blissfully unaware (or just don't care) that running servers from home is against their residential internet TOS.\n\nThis is one of my major gripes. Depending on your configuration and number of peers etc, staking gobbles up 1-5 terabytes per month of bandwidth (some configs have been running closer to 10/month!). God help us all when the ISP's decide they are over it and block/throttle this particular traffic on their residential customers.\n\nPersonally, I would just go ahead and pay for a small business internet connection that on the plus side typically comes with better support and a little more urgency in getting you back up and running in the event of an outage. Alternatively, there is colocation which seems to be entirely unpopular and doesn't seem to be considered. I'll talk about this at the end.\n\n**Chapter 2, Hardware:**\n\n*The NUC*: The general consensus for solo stakers is to buy a NUC. Honestly, I think this is pretty reasonable for most. If you consider 1 solo validator (non rocket pool) requires about 50kUSD in ETH at the moment, then spending 1-2% of that on hardware isn't too bad. If you consider ROI, a single validator is making something like 2 eth/year. At current prices you are spending about 15-30% of that first years rewards on hardware up front. Did I mention that NUC's are very power efficient too!? The only thing that seems to beat them for wattage are the wacky raspberry pi stakers!\n\nA minority of users have been going after the AMD equivalent of the NUC (like the PN50/PN51). AMD does seem to beating Intel right now in bang for buck. This is also a solid choice.\n\n*Alternative NUC cases*: NUCs are basically laptop processors soldered to a tiny motherboard in a tiny box. When they try to stay cool they can get loud. Akasa passive cooling cases have become very popular among some eth stakers. For $100 and change you can rip out the guts of your NUC and stuff them in a big aluminum heatsink that will quietly keep your unit cool. Wives tend to like them.\n\n*Processor*: As long as you have an i5 or better with 4-6 cores (or the AMD equivalent of this) you are sitting pretty. An i3 is questionable and I wouldn't consider it. Your base clock speeds are generally higher if you have less cores, so if I'm building something specifically to validate, I'd rather have an i5 than an i9. Give me 4-6 fast cores instead of 20 relatively slower cores for the same wattage.\n\n*RAM*: 16gb is adequate, but considering how relatively inexpensive memory is compared to the rest of the hardware, I would go with 32gb. 64 is insane unless you are running other services on the same server.\n\n*Hard drive*: a 2-4tb nvme ssd kicks ass and will keep your machine happy. Make sure you buy hardware that supports a nice pcie ssd and you aren't trying to use sata. A 2tb drive with auto pruning validator clients should be happy for years, but you might be inclined to be more future proof with 3-4tb. Also consider in a few years a 4tb drive will likely cost less, so maybe see how long 2tb will last and maybe upgrade if needed later.\n\n*Multiple validators*: they don't radically increase hardware requirements as long as you aren't running a bunch of different clients. You could theoretically run hundreds of validators on the same NUC without issue.\n\n**Alternative hardware options that are less popular**:\n\n*Random computer hardware that was laying around*: if you have some random spare hardware you can turn into a validator, why wouldn't you? Run it as long as you can until it becomes inadequate or starts failing!\n\n*Raspberry Pi users*: These guys drive me bonkers. If you run the right combination of clients with the right storage attached it is indeed possible to validate on a Raspberry Pi. I have absolutely zero interest in this and don't condone this form of masochism.\n\n*Old or refurbished enterprise servers*: This seems to be very unusual in the solo staker community. Let's just say there is a large difference between the crowd at r/homelab and r/ethstaker. Since you might be spending in the range of $500-1000 getting a NUC kitted out, one might consider a refurbished HP or Dell rack server. The biggest issue I find with this route is supported enterprise storage solutions are expensive and while you can indeed buy enterprise NVME drives, they are wacky expensive. Some users instead have popped in a pcie card to add cheaper retail nvme storage to their old servers. I don't think this sort of homebrew solution buys any more reliability versus a NUC, and it is going to cost more. I think it is arguably less reliable. One plus side is that it is rackmount friendly, but you are paying for it. This solution doesn't make much sense to me unless you already have an old server you want to use or really want something easy to rack mount.\n\n*New enterprise servers*: This is the five dollar sign option. I hope you have a lot of validators to make this make financial sense. You do buy yourself arguably the best hardware reliability and support, but for the money you could buy/build multiple other complete systems just to have ready to go as backups.\n\n*Build your own from scratch*: this is the buy a chassis, motherboard, processor, ram, drive etc all ala carte. I think this is a solid competitor to the NUC. The fact that the processor isn't soldered to the board is a big win in my book. This is something you can repair with off the shelf parts with limited downtime. This is a great bang for buck option if you are comfortable building something. This option can also be a rack mount solution with the right chassis.\n\n*Plug and play home staking*: Avado is the one I am familiar with. It's more expensive, requires more trust than some people are comfortable with, and updates can be slow to roll out, but they are apparently very easy to setup and run.\n\nI think that about covers all the options for home stakers? Am I missing any?\n\n**Chapter 3: Colocation (you might want to skip this bit)**\n\nThis is not actually *home* staking, but it's not cloud or cefi staking either. Colocation is where you rent out rack space at a data center and *colocate* your server(s) with others. This is often a very flexible way of hosting your own hardware. You can typically rent 1u, 2u, 4u, 8u of rack space, or even a whole rack if you want to. If you live in or near a moderately sized city, there are probably colocation providers near you. Every provider is different but you can expect to rent climate controlled rack space, power and internet at competitive rates, sometimes cheaper than getting your own small business internet at home! Power is typically backed up, so you don't need your own UPS. Internet can often be provided with failover from multiple providers. Some contracts might have flat rates for power or data and some will charge you per kwh and per gigabyte.\n\nThere are a lot of perks to colocation and I think it isn't considered enough as an option. I can't find even one mention of it on r/ethstaker.\n\nI think the main reason it isn't considered is because NUC's aren't ideal for rack mounts. While there are rack mounts you can buy for them the units themselves are DC powered (colocation providers typically bring you 208-230VAC power, and aren't going to allow you to plug your laptop style power brick in). It might be possible if you mounted the NUC in a clean rack chassis that accepted *normal* power (with the transformer mounted inside).\n\nI am personally considering going the route of built from scratch hardware in a rackmount chassis that I can colocate for a while. I think this is a great bang for buck option that rivals the NUC.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This might be a bit controversial but I thought it might be useful to some of us, so here we go.

It might be possible if you mounted the NUC in a clean rack chassis that accepted <em>normal</em> power (with the transformer mounted inside).</p>\n\n<p>I am personally considering going the route of built from scratch hardware in a rackmount chassis that I can colocate for a while. I think this is a great bang for buck option that rivals the NUC.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-29 13:44:55","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-01-29 14:37:54","id":"j6ezf73","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10o0h5d","parent_id":"t3_10o0h5d","score":34,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sm3gh34d","body":">The only thing that seems to beat them for wattage are the wacky raspberry pi stakers\n\n\nTangent, but the Rock5 is where it is at for ultra low power validators setup these days:\nhttps://ameridroid.com/products/rock5-model-b","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The only thing that seems to beat them for wattage are the wacky raspberry pi stakers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tangent, but the Rock5 is where it is at for ultra low power validators setup these days:\n<a href=\"https://ameridroid.com/products/rock5-model-b\">https://ameridroid.com/products/rock5-model-b</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-29 13:50:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j6f0fgu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10o0h5d","parent_id":"t1_j6ezf73","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/somedaysitsdark","body":"I would lump that under the category of wacky raspberry pi masochists.

If these weren't mere \"sentiment checks\", if the vote results were binding, the Parity gang would have put even more effort into manipulating the outcome, and likely would have gotten away with it; facing off against the loose larger group of individual Ethereum holders, all of which had less incentive to protect the network than Parity to attack it.

Let's watch dapps solve this and then rollups solve this before we ever gamble the base layer on this... *If* ever.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>At the time, Parity and friends, under disguises of pretend grassroots accounts and anonymous ones, ran several opinion votes then regularly stacked these polls at key moments to move the needle in their favor. </p>\n\n<p>If anything, this was precisely a demonstration of the dangers of onchain governance. If these weren&#39;t mere &quot;sentiment checks&quot;, if the vote results were binding, the Parity gang would have put even more effort into manipulating the outcome, and likely would have gotten away with it; facing off against the loose larger group of individual Ethereum holders, all of which had less incentive to protect the network than Parity to attack it.
