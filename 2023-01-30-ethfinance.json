While the core of the innovation of the model is precisely these protocols, they also serve as the main obstacle for the organisation to be classified as an association and thereby also a legal person. With maybe the exception that an incredibly extensive interpretation of non-profit associations might allow for some DAOs to fit under its classification.\n\nSome of these DAOs also provide financial services that either already falls or otherwise will fall under at least some security laws regime, depending on the nature of the services. Partly due to the inability of attaining legal personhood for the DAOs, and partly due to the immutable nature of the smart contracts, these service providing DAOs and protocols present quite a unique obstacle for legislators, regulators and other legal applicators that want to limit their potentially detrimental aspects such as their enabling of money laundering and similar activities.\n\nAs has been explored there both exist currently and has been proposed a multitude of new legislation that is intended to manage these services, ranging from requirement or registration to due diligence rules. But as of yet is there any regime currently in effect nor any proposed that intend to or seemingly will be able to solve the question of how DAOs and DEXes fit in within these new rules. The one case in which this issue has been even tangentially approached being by the SEC in its enforcement against EtherDelta, but that case relying on a significant centralised control over the services provided.\n\nThe natural conclusion from this deficiency is that this hole in the legal frameworks will be retained under the current proposals.

While the core of the innovation of the model is precisely these protocols, they also serve as the main obstacle for the organisation to be classified as an association and thereby also a legal person. With maybe the exception that an incredibly extensive interpretation of non-profit associations might allow for some DAOs to fit under its classification.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these DAOs also provide financial services that either already falls or otherwise will fall under at least some security laws regime, depending on the nature of the services. Partly due to the inability of attaining legal personhood for the DAOs, and partly due to the immutable nature of the smart contracts, these service providing DAOs and protocols present quite a unique obstacle for legislators, regulators and other legal applicators that want to limit their potentially detrimental aspects such as their enabling of money laundering and similar activities.</p>\n\n<p>As has been explored there both exist currently and has been proposed a multitude of new legislation that is intended to manage these services, ranging from requirement or registration to due diligence rules. But as of yet is there any regime currently in effect nor any proposed that intend to or seemingly will be able to solve the question of how DAOs and DEXes fit in within these new rules.
