On that topic I observe there is a labor to impact mismatch between how web3 education functions today. I see too many tutorials on the basics. Each org like BlueDAO, Bankless Academy, CollectiveShift, BoysClub, etc has their own curriculum. Some of it is even pay gated. It's a lot of replicated effort and unless it's paired with a way of access people outside our ecosystem it's having no impact. On the other end there's highly technical documents on exactly how the Beacon Chain works or the scaling strategy for Ethereum or frontier takes like /u/liberosist writes. These are written for the *dozens* of us living at the edge of the frontier. In the middle is a desert of content. Once you get past that entry level content you get chucked into places like /r/cryptocurrency and good luck to you.

On that topic I observe there is a labor to impact mismatch between how web3 education functions today. I see too many tutorials on the basics. Each org like BlueDAO, Bankless Academy, CollectiveShift, BoysClub, etc has their own curriculum. Some of it is even pay gated. It&#39;s a lot of replicated effort and unless it&#39;s paired with a way of access people outside our ecosystem it&#39;s having no impact. On the other end there&#39;s highly technical documents on exactly how the Beacon Chain works or the scaling strategy for Ethereum or frontier takes like <a href=\"/u/liberosist\">/u/liberosist</a> writes.

I am smart enough that I didn&#39;t exactly fail, but the consulting firm lived on a reputation of being the best, and I knew that for this area of expertise, I was basically a new grad.   The company I worked for was amazing, they supported me 100% and were giving me every opportunity to learn, but I knew I wasn&#39;t helping their reputation, and when the stars aligned for me to retire, I took it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m still curious if I had stuck it out a year or two more if I would&#39;ve fit in better, if I would&#39;ve been just another star in their lineup of all-stars.  I had never failed before, but this felt like a whole new game.  And frankly, it wasn&#39;t as interesting as what I had been doing, lots of &quot;google it and copy and paste&quot;.  To me programming should be thinking, no &quot;google it&quot;.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-01 05:29:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j6ruede","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10pqbiw","parent_id":"t1_j6qtf25","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/wordlemcgee","body":"Thanks for sharing this.

Conservative: You're already behind, you should have paid capital gains taxes on all of that earned ETH the moment it hit your validator or your Coinbase account even if you were not able to access it.\n2. Moderate: You owe taxes once you are able to withdraw those earned ETH so the moment that Coinbase allows you to access it (for validators, it may be when Shanghai actually goes live).\n3. Aggressive: You owe taxes only when you actually withdraw the earned ETH from your account or from you node, until then you coast tax free or even compound those gains if the protocol allows you to.\n\nIs there right and wrong when it comes to taxes? Yes, of course. It's just that the 'right' bucket is never a singular answer but rather a range of options.
