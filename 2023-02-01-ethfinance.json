So, I wanted to take the opportunity to talk about a different topic.\n\nWhen the ponzis spin back up and the mania happens, the ultrasoundmoney cult will be unbearably loud and you'll see all sorts of absurd projections around the burn, deflation and such. Some of you may remember I was skeptical of the numbers being thrown around in 2021 (having myself fallen for them earlier in 2020) - and even had a little debate with Justin Drake here. It may seem absurd now, but numbers like 20%-70% staking APR, 5% deflation were widely accepted, based off clearly unsustainable usage.\n\nInstead, it would be prudent to form a base case now, and use those numbers instead in the future. The first observation you'll see that in ETH terms, total transaction fees outside of manias are [actually relatively constant](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) \\- which is a big narrative violation of the up-only rhetoric you saw in 2021 and will see again in the next bull. (Yes, the mechanisms have changed since EIP-1559, but it's in the same order of magnitude) \\[PS, edit: other data sources like Coin Metrics do account for EIP-1559; however, as I mentioned originally, it's in the same order of magnitude\\] The $ tx fees are still going up, of course, with a larger economy and higher ETH price. But remember - burn rates, staking rates, MEV are all denominated in ETH, so it doesn't matter.\n\nIt's very likely the type of fees in 2020 (when it peaked) and 2021 will never be seen again - for the simple fact that there's orders of magnitude more blockspace available across L2s and alt-L1s - and even more coming with EIP-4844. Nevertheless, the \"premium\" ponzis and \"luxury\" status symbol type NFTs will always be on L1 - so we'll definitely see huge increases in gas prices.\n\nAnyway, getting back to the base case, and what actual sustainable revenue looks like - as mentioned above, it has been relative constant over the years. This comes with the implication that, actually, staking rewards are going to be relatively constant - in the \\~1.5%-2.5% range for priority fees + \\~1% range for MEV. Meanwhile, issuance is going to reduce over time, so we can safely conclude the long-term staking rewards are going to be somewhere in the \\~5% range. Coincidentally, at current staking rate, we should expect very mild deflation, but as more is staked this will revert back to mild inflation.\n\nNow, some will argue \"but there are whole new usecases that will come online\". Sure, and fees will go up over time in $ times, but as 7 years of data suggests, not in ETH terms. Also, as mentioned above, there's orders of magnitude more space available on L2s going forward, who will pay relatively negligible fees to L1 post EIP-4844 as there'll be a dedicated data fee market. So why won't L1 fees collapse? Because L1 will remain the premiere execution layer - even the perfect L2 won't be quite as secure and Lindy, and the venue for high-value settlements for the foreseeable future.\n\nTl;dr: staking rewards are likely going to remain the \\~5% APR range long term and inflation will probably tend towards being mildly positive, so when you see absurd projections based on unsustainable mania burns during the bull - remain resolute and sell your ETH to those who are aping in thinking 10%-20% yields and 2% deflation is sustainable.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As <a href=\"/u/15kisFUD\">u/15kisFUD</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/comment/j6m5xo7/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">pointed out</a>, the sentiment currently is neutral-ish, so it&#39;s a good time to talk about things that everyone will laugh at in bull times or be depressed over in bear times.
