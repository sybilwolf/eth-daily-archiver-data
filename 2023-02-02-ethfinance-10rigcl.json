They claim to be the most decentralized and resilient L1.\n\nApparently they have over 100k validators (not node operators) with a very low entry point of 1 GNO (~$100) instead of 32 ETH. Unlike other self-proclaimed ultra scalable L1s, they don't have very high requirements for running validators (16 GB of RAM, a 4-threaded CPU, a NVMe SSD, and bandwith usages similar to mainnet).\n\nTaking a look at Gnosis Scan, there doesn't seem to be much demand for blockspace. The base fee is currently sitting around 7 wei (yes, wei, not gwei) and the median gas price around 1.5 gwei. The gas limit is 30M just like on mainnet, but the block times are 5s vs 12s on mainnet, so they have more than twice the blockspace availability.\n\nFor reference, Polygon has a gas limit of ~30M with a ~2s block time and BSC a 140M gas limit with a ~3s block time. If we were to rank these L1s for their ratio of gas limit/block time, we would have:\n\n\n\n| Rank | Chain | Gas limit per second |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| #1 | Binance Smart Chain  | ~46M |\n| #2 | Polygon | ~15M |\n| #3 | Gnosis chain | ~6M |\n| #4 | Ethereum | ~2.5M |\n\nNote: let's keep in mind that EIP-1559 targets to have half-full blocks, so the average gas consumption of a chain running at capacity should be half of that.\n\nSome points come to mind:\n\n* If Gnosis ran at capacity, unless I'm missing something, each validator would have ~2.4x as much stress as a Ethereum validator.\n* Gnosis doesn't seem to optimize for ultra cheap transactions unlike Polygon and BSC. As we all probably know, those L1s sacrifice decentralization by increasing blockspace, which means that the average person probably can't run a validator on average hardware when the chain runs at capacity.\n* I wonder what would happen if Gnosis ran at capacity. They claim to have 100% uptime - would that still be true? Would block times slow down? Would we see very high gas fees like on Ethereum on the last bull market?\n* Is it correct to say that they are as decentralized, or more so than Ethereum? What are the actual centralization points? For example, I think it's fair to say that their xDai bridge is centralized, because its trust model is a [4-of-6 multisig](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/tokenbridge/xdai-bridge/#key-information).\n\n  However, as far as I can tell, if the bridge was compromised that would only tank the xDai token, which would be pretty bad, but shouldn't put the decentralization and censorship resistance of the chain itself at risk. Assets bridged from other sources, or native assets like POAP should be safe. Under that scenario, the xDAI token may not remain pegged to DAI, but could still remain valuable if there's demand for blockspace.\n* If they truly are decentralized, censorship resistant and can withstand congestion (even if that results in high fees like on Ethereum), then I wonder why doesn't it gain more traction?\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong in anything!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How does <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">/r/ethfinance</a> feel about Gnosis Chain?

This is what I envision when people say \u201cThe Metaverse.\u201d I know the Metaverse expands much further but I\u2019m keeping this controlled for now. A singular entity that has multiple platforms on top of it that can be interoperable with one another. I think of this like having a rewards card when going to a certain store. You can still make your purchases without the rewards card, but signing up is free and every time you shop there you\u2019ll get points towards a future purchase. So the NFL will still exist as it is today for those who aren\u2019t interested in it\u2019s web3 ecosystem, but for those who are, they can completely immerse themselves in it.\r  \n\r  \nLets start with the easiest bubble on the list, the \u201cCollections\u201d bubble. You can think of this as the museum for all your digital collectables. The easiest NFT\u2019s to think of are the player cards. Identical to the physical card packs containing NFL player cards, the NFL could sell digital card packs/ individual cards of players. They could do this straight from their main site, or you could purchase/sell some on the secondary marketplace with other fans.\r  \n\r  \nLets say I wanted to purchase a real jersey of my favorite player. When I purchase it at the pro shop I would receive the real jersey, an exclusive NFT of that player, and an NFT of the digital jersey for my collection room. Or, maybe the sponsors of the NFL could collaborate, open a pack of beer and scan the code inside to see if you get a free NFT. Maybe you could get one under a soda\u2019s bottle top. There could be a number of ways fans could add to their collection for free without purchasing anything they normally wouldn\u2019t.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nNFL ESPN 2K5 The Crib Screen Shots\r  \nCheck out this overview of the \u201cThe Crib\u201d from NFL 2k5\r  \n\r  \nWhen I was younger I played NFL 2k5 and they had this awesome \u201cThe Crib\u201d section where you could customize your glorious mansion with in-game items and trophies like rugs, helmets, arcade games, sofas and so much more. The digital jersey got me thinking of incorporating \u201cThe Crib\u201d where you would have a digital trophy room to show off all your collectables. Other fans could view your wallet address and see how you have customized your \u201cCrib\u201d or \u201cTrophy Room.\u201d You could view other wallets and see what they have collected. The best part about this is the visual representation, having the 3D boundaries representing your collection. Being able to click on the memorabilia you have purchased, or the ticket stubs of the games you have been to. Imagine on every physical game ticket you buy there is an NFT of that ticket, and you could place it in whatever room of your collection you wanted. When you click on it, it would show the highlights of that game, stats, and best photographs. Showing off to your friends and family how you went to that one game where the season turned around for your team and they eventually went on to win the Super Bowl! For mega fans out there they could go and collect tickets from fans who went to other games, but their team lost so they don\u2019t really care about that ticket. I know when my team wins the Super Bowl I would want to have every ticket from that season so I could have all the highlights in one place whenever I wanted. Or maybe to show a complete collection. This would be the digital hub of the collections bubble.\r  \n\r  \nEarning free cards/ card packs/ memorabilia :\r  \n\r  \nFantasy Football: At the start of every new season you would earn X number of card packs. Winners at the end of the season could earn packs.\r  \n\r  \nStadium: Buying a ticket and physically going to the game would earn you X number of card packs. The ticket itself would be an NFT to place in your collection, maybe you earn some other digital memorabilia for being there on a special night. For instance, a player broke an NFL or team record that night, every ticket owner that day earns some memorabilia of the player.\r  \n\r  \nMadden 20XX: Buying the video game would earn you X number of card packs. Unlocking certain achievements can earn card packs/memorabilia.\r  \n\r  \nThe Draft: Watching the NFL draft would earn you X number of card packs/cards of certain players being drafted. Attendance NFT for physically going to the draft.\r  \n\r  \nGambling: Playing in certain games would earn you card packs. Winners earn card packs. High stakes games, everyone who participates earns a card pack.\r  \n\r  \nPurchases from the Pro Shop: Buying physical items could result in its digital twin NFT. Spending over $X number of dollars gets you the NFT of the month.\r  \n\r  \nFollowing up is the \u201cFantasy Football\u201d bubble. I felt like I had to preface this one with earning the free card packs to make sense. This could work in a number of different ways, but primarily coincides with the \u201cCollections\u201d bubble. As you collect NFT\u2019s of your favorite players, you can play them in your fantasy league. Regular Fantasy Football would still exist, this doesn\u2019t replace it, it enhances the experience for those who are more into the NFL\u2019s web3 ecosystem than those who aren\u2019t. Having the ability to earn free card packs is crucial to making this not pay-to-win. There are plenty of fantasy variations that could make it viable for casual or hardcore owners, without forcing the fans to purchase packs and own every single player in the league. This next idea may be a ways out, but I feel like having past experiences is very nice to have in your collection. At the end of every Fantasy Season, NFT\u2019s would be generated for each player in the league, captivating the standings of each league player and possible outcomes of each matchup. I\u2019m sure the losers of the league would discard this NFT, but the winners may like to look back on how they kicked everyone\u2019s butt three years ago.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The NFL Bubbles</p>\n\n<p>This is a quick layout I made illustrating that the NFL could create a plethora of ecosystems that each have their own unique area of expertise, but NFT\u2019s from one bubble can be used in another. This is what I envision when people say \u201cThe Metaverse.\u201d I know the Metaverse expands much further but I\u2019m keeping this controlled for now. A singular entity that has multiple platforms on top of it that can be interoperable with one another. I think of this like having a rewards card when going to a certain store. You can still make your purchases without the rewards card, but signing up is free and every time you shop there you\u2019ll get points towards a future purchase. So the NFL will still exist as it is today for those who aren\u2019t interested in it\u2019s web3 ecosystem, but for those who are, they can completely immerse themselves in it.</p>\n\n<p>Lets start with the easiest bubble on the list, the \u201cCollections\u201d bubble. You can think of this as the museum for all your digital collectables. The easiest NFT\u2019s to think of are the player cards. Identical to the physical card packs containing NFL player cards, the NFL could sell digital card packs/ individual cards of players. They could do this straight from their main site, or you could purchase/sell some on the secondary marketplace with other fans.</p>\n\n<p>Lets say I wanted to purchase a real jersey of my favorite player. When I purchase it at the pro shop I would receive the real jersey, an exclusive NFT of that player, and an NFT of the digital jersey for my collection room. Or, maybe the sponsors of the NFL could collaborate, open a pack of beer and scan the code inside to see if you get a free NFT. Maybe you could get one under a soda\u2019s bottle top. There could be a number of ways fans could add to their collection for free without purchasing anything they normally wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p>NFL ESPN 2K5 The Crib Screen Shots</p>\n\n<p>Check out this overview of the \u201cThe Crib\u201d from NFL 2k5</p>\n\n<p>When I was younger I played NFL 2k5 and they had this awesome \u201cThe Crib\u201d section where you could customize your glorious mansion with in-game items and trophies like rugs, helmets, arcade games, sofas and so much more. The digital jersey got me thinking of incorporating \u201cThe Crib\u201d where you would have a digital trophy room to show off all your collectables. Other fans could view your wallet address and see how you have customized your \u201cCrib\u201d or \u201cTrophy Room.\u201d You could view other wallets and see what they have collected. The best part about this is the visual representation, having the 3D boundaries representing your collection. Being able to click on the memorabilia you have purchased, or the ticket stubs of the games you have been to. Imagine on every physical game ticket you buy there is an NFT of that ticket, and you could place it in whatever room of your collection you wanted. When you click on it, it would show the highlights of that game, stats, and best photographs. Showing off to your friends and family how you went to that one game where the season turned around for your team and they eventually went on to win the Super Bowl! For mega fans out there they could go and collect tickets from fans who went to other games, but their team lost so they don\u2019t really care about that ticket. I know when my team wins the Super Bowl I would want to have every ticket from that season so I could have all the highlights in one place whenever I wanted. Or maybe to show a complete collection. This would be the digital hub of the collections bubble.</p>\n\n<p>Earning free cards/ card packs/ memorabilia :</p>\n\n<p>Fantasy Football: At the start of every new season you would earn X number of card packs. Winners at the end of the season could earn packs.</p>\n\n<p>Stadium: Buying a ticket and physically going to the game would earn you X number of card packs. The ticket itself would be an NFT to place in your collection, maybe you earn some other digital memorabilia for being there on a special night. For instance, a player broke an NFL or team record that night, every ticket owner that day earns some memorabilia of the player.</p>\n\n<p>Madden 20XX: Buying the video game would earn you X number of card packs. Unlocking certain achievements can earn card packs/memorabilia.</p>\n\n<p>The Draft: Watching the NFL draft would earn you X number of card packs/cards of certain players being drafted. Attendance NFT for physically going to the draft.</p>\n\n<p>Gambling: Playing in certain games would earn you card packs. Winners earn card packs. High stakes games, everyone who participates earns a card pack.</p>\n\n<p>Purchases from the Pro Shop: Buying physical items could result in its digital twin NFT. Spending over $X number of dollars gets you the NFT of the month.</p>\n\n<p>Following up is the \u201cFantasy Football\u201d bubble. I felt like I had to preface this one with earning the free card packs to make sense. This could work in a number of different ways, but primarily coincides with the \u201cCollections\u201d bubble. As you collect NFT\u2019s of your favorite players, you can play them in your fantasy league. Regular Fantasy Football would still exist, this doesn\u2019t replace it, it enhances the experience for those who are more into the NFL\u2019s web3 ecosystem than those who aren\u2019t. Having the ability to earn free card packs is crucial to making this not pay-to-win. There are plenty of fantasy variations that could make it viable for casual or hardcore owners, without forcing the fans to purchase packs and own every single player in the league. This next idea may be a ways out, but I feel like having past experiences is very nice to have in your collection. At the end of every Fantasy Season, NFT\u2019s would be generated for each player in the league, captivating the standings of each league player and possible outcomes of each matchup. I\u2019m sure the losers of the league would discard this NFT, but the winners may like to look back on how they kicked everyone\u2019s butt three years ago.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-02 08:27:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j6xiuav","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10rigcl","parent_id":"t1_j6xirrk","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CoCleric","body":"For the video game Madden NFL Bubble, you could earn NFT\u2019s of players for winning a season on All Madden Mode (less caliber players for lower difficulty). You could earn them by beating certain challenges or playing online. There could be tournaments online to give away players, or other digital memorabilia that would be at no extra cost other than obtaining the game. The NFT\u2019s could be used as skins for their certain player too, maybe a throwback jersey or color rush when displaying in your collections room. Then once the player has earned enough NFT cards to roster a whole team, they can try to beat a season with that team as a challenge earning a trophy/NFT as a reward. The point of this bubble is to add more to the game through obtaining tokens for free rather than being extractive and forcing fans to buy them. No microtransactions should be a part of this. Players that are really good at the game could earn rare NFT\u2019s and sell them if they so choose, or add them to their collection. I think for a game like this to happen the Madden franchise would have to change. It would just be called NFL Madden and they would only release a new game every 4 years with an updated physics engine and graphics. Personally I hate EA, so I don\u2019t purchase the Madden games but I do find it frustrating that year over year they resell the same game to people. It should be $60 for one game that lasts years and their revenue would be tied in from people purchasing packs of players from the main NFL bubble. Greed is pretty terrible though so I know EA would never do the right thing here\u2026\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\u201c The Draft\u201d Bubble may be a bit different, the point for the NFL is to draw viewers in so they can demand more money from sponsors advertisements. If they were to show QR codes periodically throughout the broadcast, giving away different tokens for free I feel like it would draw in more viewers for longer. One could be a proof of attendance token saying that I viewed or went to the NFL draft. Another could be the first overall pick\u2019s NFT, and other prospects. Finally, they could have one called the \u201cTeam Token.\u201d When you scan the code it brings you to a website that asks what your favorite team is. You are then sent a team specific token to your address once the draft has concluded. It would contain artwork of the team and all of the players drafted for that year and what school they came from. I don\u2019t know the limitations of how much information would be stored in these NFT\u2019s so I want to keep it realistic. If they are a static image then it would be the team logo in the background with the picks and what round they went in. These could then be placed in your digital trophy room / crib and could have more data there instead of on the NFT itself.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nOf course what makes the game of football so great is being there live in attendance. This is where the \u201cStadium\u201d bubble comes into play. First of all, fuck ticket master and all ticket services that scalp fans of their money. Let\u2019s be way too hopeful here and say only one address can purchase up to 4 tickets at once. Once you own the Ticket NFT you can place it in your collection and it would be scannable from your phone when entering the stadium itself. Depending on section you could earn discounts on drinks/food, just scan your NFT at checkout for the discount. The ticket NFT, as I said before, would hold the highlights, stats, and images from that game. If you are season ticket holder it would show a top down image of the stadium with your seats highlighted. You would automatically be entered into a raffle each year for Super Bowl tickets provided by your team. It really comes down to the imagination of the team owners and what they are willing to give their fans.\r  \n\r  \nI mentioned the Metaverse before and I want to clarify that non of these would really have utility outside of the NFL application other than maybe selling for profit on Opensea or Looksrare.

Also, this NFL app would have to be built on a Layer 2 for fast cheap/free transactions, enabling everyone to participate regardless of financial background.\r  \n\r  \nThere are infinite possibilities that I currently cannot see with my Ethmagination. The future could be bright with aligning company IP with NFT\u2019s and their ecosystem if implemented correctly. Aside from the money aspect, I want most of these NFT\u2019s to be for sentimental value, being able to quickly look back and see you went to a special event. A jersey/clothing article that got lost or worn out but the digital twin will always remain. All in one place, for everyone or certain people to view.
