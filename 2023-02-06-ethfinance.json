There's still some mystery on how it's gonna play out and what's gonna happen. Is black check even possible now? Some people are trying to form collaborations or DAOs to get one. Additionally, token IDs matter too because when you are burning you'd be able to carry on 1 of the token IDs, so for example you are burning 80 checks to get a new version and you'd choose the best token ID you have while getting rid of other 79. Black check with #1 token ID would be the grail of grails there.\n\nAnd in a way all these things interconnected and create a closed cycle loops, thus amplifying each other.\n\nI'm probably missing so much other stuff too but that should be enough.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I havent looked into Opepen so I&#39;ve held some checks and know a bit more about them so let&#39;s talk about it.</p>\n\n<p>To simplify and not make it an essay, let&#39;s just see: </p>\n\n<h3>why might they have value and worth 2.2E each right now while but were available to mint for $8 just a bit more than a month ago?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Jack knows how to visualize value in a <em>witty way</em> (I dont have a good word for it but it&#39;s that intricate type of art).

I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a thread somewhere out there with a proper math that explains why it&#39;s only possible for 3 black checks to exist but I think it would require like 4000 checks or something to burn to get it and that would be the ultimate flex. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Why some checks have more value than the tother?</h3>\n\n<p>Currently (pre-burn) they have the same PFP, the only difference is their token ID or # (e.g. checks 69, 420, 6666). Regular rarity rules would apply to them, thus making some numbers more valuable.</p>\n\n<h3>What are the other aspects that are helping the project?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Many people creating derivatives, this usually happens only to good projects.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lots of big names tweeting about it or even making deriv references. Here&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/budweiserusa/status/1620892046390366208\">budweiser&#39;s</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seedphrase/status/1622311038212521985\">seedphrase (aka the only punk w 7 attributes)</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Price rising, people talking, more attention and repeat. There&#39;s still some mystery on how it&#39;s gonna play out and what&#39;s gonna happen. Is black check even possible now? Some people are trying to form collaborations or DAOs to get one. Additionally, token IDs matter too because when you are burning you&#39;d be able to carry on 1 of the token IDs, so for example you are burning 80 checks to get a new version and you&#39;d choose the best token ID you have while getting rid of other 79. Black check with #1 token ID would be the grail of grails there.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And in a way all these things interconnected and create a closed cycle loops, thus amplifying each other.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m probably missing so much other stuff too but that should be enough.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-06 23:41:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j7jpm7g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10uz7x0","parent_id":"t1_j7i4b2w","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Luukiemans","body":"Damn you should repost this on the new Daily!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Damn you should repost this on the new Daily!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-07 02:37:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j7k1vkx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10uz7x0","parent_id":"t1_j7jpm7g","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/696_eth","body":"I did ;)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I did ;)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-07 10:15:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j7lmno9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10uz7x0","parent_id":"t1_j7k1vkx","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/nitter_not_twitter","body":"[2](https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1622434936580968452)  \n\n[3](https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1622252437250646016)  \n\n[4](https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1620069497179901952)  \n\n[5](https://nitter.snopyta.org/visualizevalue/status/1617158917972189186)  \n\n[6](https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1621549292010852355)  \n\n[Jack has been transparent, communicating clearly even if he's unclear about what he's doing](https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1611726527590187016)  \n\n[budweiser's](https://nitter.snopyta.org/budweiserusa/status/1620892046390366208)  \n\n[seedphrase (aka the only punk w 7 attributes)](https://nitter.snopyta.org/seedphrase/status/1622311038212521985)  \n\n ^(I'm a bot | )[^(Why & About)](https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&subject=Opt+Out&message=optout)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1622434936580968452\">2</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1622252437250646016\">3</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1620069497179901952\">4</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/visualizevalue/status/1617158917972189186\">5</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1621549292010852355\">6</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/jackbutcher/status/1611726527590187016\">Jack has been transparent, communicating clearly even if he&#39;s unclear about what he&#39;s doing</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/budweiserusa/status/1620892046390366208\">budweiser&#39;s</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/seedphrase/status/1622311038212521985\">seedphrase (aka the only punk w 7 attributes)</a>  </p>\n\n<p><sup>I&#39;m a bot | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/\"><sup>Why &amp; About</sup></a><sup> | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&amp;subject=Opt+Out&amp;message=optout\"><sup>Opt Out</sup></a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-06 23:41:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j7jpmu2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10uz7x0","parent_id":"t1_j7jpm7g","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/viners","body":"Seems like just another pump and dump.
