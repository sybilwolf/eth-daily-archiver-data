It is a worthwhile adventure but it is perilous. **Here be dragons** There are no road signs labeling all the tunnels that branch from here. Most of the proper safety warnings only come from other travelers. If you're attentive and lucky you'll hear about these hazards from other travelers before running into them yourself. In that case you may see other people respond with some common wisdom experienced explorer's know by heart:\n\n* Not your keys not your coins.\n\n* Your private key is everything in your wallet. You shouldn't even have digital access to it outside your hardware wallet.\n\n* No one reputable is ever giving away ETH.

If you're on Twitter, walk the social media chain of who someone reputable follows. If you're on Youtube, look for many different descriptions of the same topic so you can start to spot discrepancies. Once you find a welcoming community (they do exist), DYOR and use that community to verify your discoveries. This is how you build networks, knowledge, and wealth without getting swarmed by grifters. If you do choose to delve into the chaos of Base Camp One, lurk for awhile and never take an action someone there recommends until you verify it through your expanding network of curated spaces.\n\nAlongside this is a general theme to this wisdom. **Do not hurry.** Whatever the current hype cycle is that you read about yesterday, it is not the last opportunity for extraordinary gains in this space. You did not magically luck out and descend into the Rabbit Hole just as a once-in-a-lifetime rocket is just taking off and you need to act now or miss it forever. There are multiple rockets every year here. The trick is being informed enough to discern which ones aren't going to explode on you. In traditional equities an 8% yield in equity appreciation is considered a fine year. 8% isn't even a remarkable hour down here. There *will* be another opportunity this year. **Slow down**.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>When you reach the end of what we commonly call &quot;onboarding&quot; and the curriculum I&#39;ve seen for web3 you commonly have:</p>\n\n<p>1) Metamask installed with a hot wallet.</p>\n\n<p>2) You&#39;ve signed at least one message.</p>\n\n<p>3) You&#39;ve gotten a POAP or something from your onboarding organization.</p>\n\n<p>4) You&#39;ve withdrawn some ETH from a centralized exchange in order to pay for transactions.</p>\n\n<p>5) You may have followed a guide from a Youtube tutorial for a specific app like Uniswap to wrap and unwrap some ETH or something harmless.</p>\n\n<p>6) If you&#39;re lucky they walked you through setting up a cold wallet backed by a hardware wallet.
