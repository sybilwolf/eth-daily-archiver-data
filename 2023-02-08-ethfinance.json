It's me, back to interrupt your day with more off topic posts! In my pursuit to get people to migrate to open source software, I have another great Linux distribution for my potential Mac converts out there. Elementary OS. Elementary sports a completely custom Desktop Environment called Pantheon. This Desktop was built exclusively for ElementaryOS and it not only has a very retro-modern macOS aesthetic, it functions similarly as well. So my macOS bretheren and sistheren out there should be able to adapt quickly without too much change in their work flow. Pantheon was written in Vala (had to look this one up, cool!) built using GTK libraries so apps written for Gnome fit right in with Elementary's superior UI.\n\nmacOS users will also feel at home with ElementaryOS thanks to a small selection of included apps like calendar, notes, reminders, and even a highly integrated web browser like Safari. This browser sports DuckDuckGo search as the default and includes a built in ad and tracking blocker. No plugin support so power users will want something else but it's perfect for the basic surfers out there. If you need more apps there is a curated app store that features a small but sizeable collection of high quality apps for just about any need. Apps in the Elementary app store are often modified or extended for better integration with Pantheon, so no app feels out of place and functions perfectly without ever having to use the terminal to change something just to get an app to launch. That also means there's a limited selection of apps and usually only one option for each type of app. No worries though! Using the included ElementaryOS web browser you can go to [FlatHub](https://flathub.org) and install any Linux app directly from the web.\n\nOf course, ElementaryOS 7 is built on Ubuntu 22.04 so you still get all the features, options, security and app selection that provides, so power users can easily step outside of Elementary's app store and install any Linux package they need. Elementary also has excellent support for older Intel based Mac hardware that Apple stopped supporting, including bundling all the right proprietary drivers to support most Macs out of the box. The hotkeys are even setup just like a Mac with CMD+C to copy. CMD+V to paste, etc ... so you don't have to retrain your muscle memory. I hate doing that. Thanks Elementary.

This is a scaled down version.))\n\n**Current State**\n\nIt's the question of \u201cWhat training is already out there in the ecosystem\u201d? Lawrd where do I even begin! If you've been in this space a little while you already know how much training there is in web3. However, they fall within similar categories based on who the audience is.\n\n\\- Onboarding's for new users\n\n\\- Content specific to a protocol, tool, DAO or a technology\n\n\\- Alpha (ie: foreknowledge) on emerging tech or investment opportunities\n\n\\- Bootcamps for Devs\n\nThere is an unusual amount of multi-track exploration amongst web3 explorers. People enter the space from a solidity developer bootcamp and then they may backtrack and take an intro to crypto course. There isn\u2019t one path up the mountain, but rather many with their twists, turns and pitfalls along the way. Think about this metaphor: it's like climbing Mount Everest. Everyone starts at Base Camp One. But, there are [many different routes up the mountain](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/North-Face-Everest-Routes.webp).\n\nLearning about web3/blockchain/crypto is the same way. Most people in the industry will move in between these route as they learn. They might like a meandering path with its stunning vistas or seek out the direct path with zero stops along the way. Thinking about the opportunities for education in crypto space is vast and daunting, just like climbing a mountain.\n\n**What does success look like?**\n\nSuccess looks different to different people. One person's success might just be to see the mountain, another might want to make it past a certain elevation, while someone else might want to find a whole new route up the mountain. Setting your destination before you even step foot on the mountain is part of determining your success. Similarly in education, the success metrics change based on the needs of a training. When it comes to the web3 education space I\u2019d like to ask the same thing. It\u2019s an important question to ask \u201cWhat does success look like for a web3 educator?\n\nHow often will this training be utilized (one-time use, on-going, for a specified period)? If you're creating cutting edge training be prepared for it to go stale quickly. It happened to me a ton when I was working on something that was part of an ongoing training documentation. Say, I've created a video walk-through or a step-by-step guide and the team changes the UI, I either have to start over or scrap the training. But, if it was a one-time use and the training is complete. The change to the UI won't matter. I may already consider this training a success.\n\n**For me, one of the key metrics of success is that people use the materials I create.** If I\u2019m going to spend time and effort on something, it's with the intention of someone taking it. My level of effort will be commiserate with answers to the questions: \"How often will the training be utilized? Is there even an audience for the training I\u2019m creating?\".\n\nWhat is the scalability of this training? Did I create something that was boutique to a particular audience or hardware? Is it scalable to other audiences or tools? It's okay if the answer is no. Not everything needs to be scalable. It's like the type of gear you would need on the mountain; it'll never be a top seller for The North Face. It's too niche, but they make it anyway.\n\nDon't expect 1,000 people to take your eLearning module or attend your training session when the audience/people that are interested number in the 100s. This is the equivalent of yelling into a vacuum hoping someone will hear you. Is this an effective use of your time? It could be, if you're creating the material to demonstrate a new skill or signal knowledge on a particular topic. But, again knowing how you are planning to measure success will set you up for success.\n\n**Web3 Gap Analysis**\n\nLike I said before, you shouldn\u2019t create a training just to do it. If you were on the mountain and a crevasse opened up people would have to find a way around it or over it. People would problem solve until they found a solution. Web3 education needs an objective or a problem to solve. It needs to fill a need or a knowledge gap. The Gap Analysis can get to the core of a training need. People are feeling that there is still a need within the crypto education space. So, they are rushing in to answer the call. That\u2019s why there are so many trainings being created and recreated.\n\nIf you reflect on the sheer amount of new user onboardings, dev boot camps or different protocols \"learn\" offerings. The basics are covered.\n\nThis image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is mind-the-gap.webp The \u201cbasic\u201d trainings or onboarding are like reaching Base Camp One on Mount Everest. Everyone starts here. This may also be their final destination. But, if you yearn to learn more and dive deeper into the ecosystem you may start to explore a deeper knowledge or higher-level education. The next step would be to ascend to Base Camp Two or even Base Camp Three and onto the summit. Everything past Base Camp One is where things start to get difficult: crevasses, wind storms, avalanches, faulty equipment or losing your guide. *Next level education materials are what\u2019s missing in crypto education.*\n\nSomeone might argue with this point, but hear me out. Granted there is a ton of information out there in the \u201cAlpha\u201d spheres that could be included in this higher-level category. None of this material is curated in a digestible way. It\u2019s usually a podcast, a twitter thread, or a Coindesk article. For this type of educational material, I\u2019m thinking of a comparison of two protocols for staking, how to file your crypto taxes, explaining liquidity mining. From my perspective, this is where the true gap in crypto education lies. I know that things change often and quickly in the space.\n\n**This is the education gap. This is the need. The trail has been blazed up the mountain; we need a map or a guide to get us to the trail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**TLDR:** Based on my analysis of the space, we don't need to be creating more web3 education. There are a ton of training and education materials out there. But, we need to be mindful of who our audience are and what we deem as successful. We need to be curating from the current material and creating new materials on niche topics.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/scaling-web3-ed/\">SCALING WEB3 EDUCATION</a></p>\n\n<p><sup>(Self-serving link to full blog post.

Meaning that smoothing brings more validators during bullish times and the chain loses validators during bearish times. Polynya argues this is a [recipe for a disaster](https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1585634669801766913) when things inevitably deleverage, and it might be a good idea to decouple staking from that whole mess, and burning would help with that by having a more stable validator set regardless of the level of on-chain economic activity\n\n* Smoothing offers some level of \"censorship rebate\", even with inclusion lists. If it costs you N eth in bribes for builders to ignore specific transactions, and you control 10% of the validator set, then you'll get 0.1\u00d7N eth back of the cost of your censorship. If it's burned then you get none of it back. \n\n**On a technical level:**\n\n* Smoothing leads to more validators, and more validators = more load on the beacon chain\n\n* The chain can control how much issuance it gives to stakers, but not how much MEV the market generates (intrinsic vs extrinsic rewards). So burning leads to more control over the validator set, making Single Slot Finality easier if we need to cap the validator set for technical reasons\n\n**On an economic level**\n\n* Given the current issuance formula (proportional to square root of staked eth), more stakers also means more ETH issuance, arguably \"overpaying\" validators needlessly if they join in for the extra MEV rewards. Note that [Vitalik has proposed](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality) changing the formula so that issuance becomes negative if there are too many validators, in the context of SSF. MEV smoothing + negative issuance would ultimately lead to MEV burn but more indirectly than the burn auction mechanism I proposed a while back\n\n* Burning or smoothing doesn't change per-validator yield. e.g. if the risk adjusted yield stabilizes at say, 3%, then new validators are gonna come in when it's above that, and existing validators are gonna drop out when it's below that. Doesn't matter if the yield comes only from issuance or mostly from MEV\n\n* Burning is effectively the same as smoothing, except it smooths MEV over every ETH holder, whether or not they're staking - partially mitigating the whole \"PoS = rich get richer\" argument when value that would have flown into the pocket of the staker class instead flows in the pockets of everyone proportionally\n\n* Similar to one of the points above, staking yield would be more stable under MEV burn\n\n* Interesting side effect of MEV burn: Priority fees AKA tips are also one form of MEV, so that would get burned too \u2013 while still doing its job in giving transactions a higher priority when necessary\n\n**On a philosophical level** (subjective stuff)\n\n* When you think about it, validators aren't really entitled to MEV profits any more than they are entitled to 1559's burned fees. It's fairer to say it belongs to no one and everyone at the same time\n\n * In an ideal world the value generated from toxic MEV from stuff like sandwiching belongs to the people getting sandwiched, but \"good\" MEV like arbitrage and liquidation is inevitable. The smoothing vs burning question mostly puts aside the question of toxic MEV, leaving it to other solutions like encrypted mempools\n\n* Hasu argues that the point above is effectively moot due to up-only LSD dominance leading to MEV being effectively distributed to ETH holders even if it's smoothed\n\n* We're already in a paradigm where the people doing the actual work related to MEV (builders) don't reap the benefits, validators passively get it all as a natural result of the monopoly they have over each individual slot\n\n* Maybe it's all completely moot on the long term, as economic activity moves to L2, the MEV will be captured by L2 sequencers, leaving L1 builders to profit mostly from priority fees from blobs. \n\n * Rollups that wish to have the same liveness guarantee as Layer 1 will leave some MEV to Layer 1.
