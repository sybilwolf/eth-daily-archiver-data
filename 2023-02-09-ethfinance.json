Its not a coincidence that the one crypto person the SEC was actually willing to have dialogue with was the one making donations across the board to politicians. </p>\n\n<p>Its frustrating because we have people who literally became billionaires from a 10k-20k investment and it would probably only take 50 million in donations to buy out most meaningful politicians to have pro crypto stances. </p>\n\n<p>Its not even lost money because what is holding the space back is there is ZERO clarity on what you can and cant do in this space. With regulatory clarity more institutions and HNW individuals who have been waiting on the sideline would push the price up. </p>\n\n<p>Instead every tribe in this space attacks each other as the SEC slowly eats our lunch and pushes to make us irrelevant. Despite what people say, condemnation from the SEC and an attack on exchanges/on ramps/off ramps will make us a niche group of people who overall in the grand scheme , irrelevant.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-09 20:32:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j7xwwn1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10xn2mv","parent_id":"t3_10xn2mv","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hipaces","body":"Your last paragraph is the most important one IMO.
