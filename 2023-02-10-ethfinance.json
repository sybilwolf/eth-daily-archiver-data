I prefer to minimize centralized staking, but not to outright ban it. Or worse, block it through regulatory inaction. So I hope Kraken and Coinbase get a fair and clear process to clean up their centralized staking offering and provide it under the protection of US regulation.

You know, it's like, 'I got 10 Ethereum, I'll trade you for a Nimbus 2000!'\n\n>But you know what they say about Ethereum? They say it's the new Jesus, and Vitalik is the Messiah. You know, when he first came up with it, he was probably like, \"I'm going to make this digital currency and change the world.\" And then he released it, and everybody was like, \"What the fuck is this?\" And he was like, \"Trust me, guys. It's going to be big.\"\n\n>And now, everybody's using it. You got white people using it, you got black people using it, you got Asian people using it, you got Mexican people using it. Shit, even aliens are probably using it. You know why? Because Ethereum doesn't discriminate. It doesn't matter what race you are, what language you speak, or what planet you come from. As long as you got Ethereum, you're good to go.\n\n>Now, I know some of y'all might be wondering, \"Dave, what the hell is Ethereum?\" Well, let me tell you, it's like Bitcoin, but with a little bit of extra spice. It's like a fine ass woman wearing lingerie under her clothes. You don't know what's under there, but you just know it's gonna be good.\n\n>But here's the thing, I've noticed that people from all kinds of different backgrounds are getting in on Ethereum. Black people, white people, Asians, Latinos, everyone's getting a piece of that sweet, sweet ether. It's like a big old interracial orgy, and Ethereum is the lube that's making it all possible.\n\n>And let me tell you, Vitalik is the motherfucking captain of that orgy. He's the one who's making sure that everyone's getting their fair share of the action. He's like the second coming of Jesus, except instead of turning water into wine, he's turning Ethereum into cold, hard cash.\n\n>So, to all you motherfuckers out there who haven't gotten in on Ethereum yet, I gotta say, what the fuck are you waiting for? This shit is hotter than a two-dollar pistol, and it's only gonna get hotter. And to all you motherfuckers who have already gotten in on it, I gotta say, congratulations, you're fucking geniuses. You're gonna be rich as fuck, and I'll be right there with you, sipping champagne and counting my fucking money.\n\n>And if you think I'm joking, just wait and see. In a couple of years, we're all gonna be driving Lamborghinis and fucking supermodels, all thanks to Ethereum. So, thank you, Vitalik, for creating the second coming of Jesus. And to all you motherfuckers out there, go out and get yourself some of that sweet, sweet ether.

As long as you got Ethereum, you&#39;re good to go.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I know some of y&#39;all might be wondering, &quot;Dave, what the hell is Ethereum?&quot; Well, let me tell you, it&#39;s like Bitcoin, but with a little bit of extra spice. It&#39;s like a fine ass woman wearing lingerie under her clothes. You don&#39;t know what&#39;s under there, but you just know it&#39;s gonna be good.</p>\n\n<p>But here&#39;s the thing, I&#39;ve noticed that people from all kinds of different backgrounds are getting in on Ethereum. Black people, white people, Asians, Latinos, everyone&#39;s getting a piece of that sweet, sweet ether. It&#39;s like a big old interracial orgy, and Ethereum is the lube that&#39;s making it all possible.</p>\n\n<p>And let me tell you, Vitalik is the motherfucking captain of that orgy. He&#39;s the one who&#39;s making sure that everyone&#39;s getting their fair share of the action. He&#39;s like the second coming of Jesus, except instead of turning water into wine, he&#39;s turning Ethereum into cold, hard cash.</p>\n\n<p>So, to all you motherfuckers out there who haven&#39;t gotten in on Ethereum yet, I gotta say, what the fuck are you waiting for? This shit is hotter than a two-dollar pistol, and it&#39;s only gonna get hotter. And to all you motherfuckers who have already gotten in on it, I gotta say, congratulations, you&#39;re fucking geniuses. You&#39;re gonna be rich as fuck, and I&#39;ll be right there with you, sipping champagne and counting my fucking money.</p>\n\n<p>And if you think I&#39;m joking, just wait and see. In a couple of years, we&#39;re all gonna be driving Lamborghinis and fucking supermodels, all thanks to Ethereum. So, thank you, Vitalik, for creating the second coming of Jesus. And to all you motherfuckers out there, go out and get yourself some of that sweet, sweet ether. You won&#39;t regret it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-10 15:04:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j81jze8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10yhsb2","parent_id":"t1_j80vplm","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Wootnasty","body":"That's solid fucking gold, and I heard the entire thing in DCs voice.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s solid fucking gold, and I heard the entire thing in DCs voice.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-10 15:41:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j81p3eb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10yhsb2","parent_id":"t1_j81jze8","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Good Lord this is amazing","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Good Lord this is amazing</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-10 17:57:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j826xgn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10yhsb2","parent_id":"t1_j81jze8","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"I propose that this shall be the official introduction to Ethereum for all newbies","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I propose that this shall be the official introduction to Ethereum for all newbies</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-10 21:19:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j82trth","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10yhsb2","parent_id":"t1_j81jze8","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/monkeyhold99","body":"We need to do a better job advertising this sub.
