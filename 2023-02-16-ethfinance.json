Jeremiah has been a absolutely incredible servant of the <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">/r/ethfinance</a> community, he has put more time into cultivating the health of our Ethereum community than anyone I&#39;ve ever met, but he won&#39;t accept a penny. Not because he doesn&#39;t deserve it, but because he loves y&#39;all so much and he&#39;s afraid to be seen as a sellout. I, for one, trust Jeremiah&#39;s direction and would feel happy if he received some kind of compensation for his efforts, I&#39;m sad that thus far he has felt unable to do so. I think it&#39;s worth noting that being a servant of the community doesn&#39;t mean anyone should take a vow of poverty. I am happy to be a positive leader in many communities and I am comfortable accepting the generosity of Paul and EY who know that we&#39;re doing passion work and it&#39;s good to reward that.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-16 14:01:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j8trkjg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_113jhtv","parent_id":"t1_j8tp8oy","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/15kisFUD","body":"Absolutely!

And the protocol design has multiple ways to ensure we get there:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>By tuning the supply side, making ETH more scarce until the scarcity is such that the price raises until the deflationary regime ends.</li>\n<li>By tuning the demand side, making staked ETH yield juicier which attracts new users to acquire and lock-up ETH.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In general, you should expect deflationary periods to precede and continue during the bull-run, while inflationary periods should occur at the end of bull-runs and during bear markets. Over very long time-frames ETH net monetary inflation is most likely going to be 0 or positive.</p>\n\n<p>Given current (last 7 days) network revenues ETH is deflationary at any price below ~ 2700 USD. But the fee revenues are trending up as we have kicked-up some reflexivity.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-17 01:01:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j8vv7kd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_113jhtv","parent_id":"t1_j8ul1ki","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/etheraider","body":"At the risk of jinxing it I\u2019m gonna say my original thesis of the Luna,FTX, 3AC liquidations shortening the bear market is evidently playing out pretty well.
