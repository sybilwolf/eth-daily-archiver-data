Most trading volume has occurred right in the 1200-1500 range. I guess that kind of counts for something. \n\nAnyway, just want to say I've missed this community. Will probably be checking back in more often in the coming months. Haven't even been lurking or upvoting the daily this past year or so. Downright shameful behavior. \n\nThe bear market hibernation has felt long and mostly depressing for me, honestly. I hope everyone else has been faring a little better. So far during this bear market, I've lost the love of my life and sold an engagement ring (huge ouch), been to therapy more times than I can count, contemplated quitting my job about a thousand times, and even contemplated harming myself a few times. Not really *because* of the bear market -- it's just an odd parallel that my personal life seemed to really be on the upswing during 2019-21, and then everything seemed to fall apart all at once for me -- I sort of went down with the rocketship per se. \n\nOn the bright side, I've also lost about 20lbs, traveled and reconnected with old friends, and recently found new loves in terms of a new relationship, new hobbies, and even aspects of my own personality that I've learned to embrace in a healthier way.   \n\nBeen slowly rebuilding my stack as well -- I posted back in 2021 that I sold out completely on the way down, around the 3k range. Taxes were a huge bitch, but I still came away with a life changing amount of money (for me), which was great. Desk shitting money? No. But, I used my gains to pay down some law school debt and buy my first home. Just going to throw this out there - home ownership is highly overrated. I miss my fat stack of ETH. I'm sure that's no surprise to most of you. \n\nCheers y'all.

Phiz does a lot of great stuff for ETHFi and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. This stuff often costs Mr. Phiz money... his own money, out of his own pocket. Now, I know Phiz is a bad example because he's a fabulously, independently wealthy person living in his own private villa on the beaches of northern Italy. So... you know... money isn't that important to him, but you know what is? *TIME.* Despite being a super hero, Phiz can't get more time. He's forced to obey the same rules of physics as the rest of us mortals. Hey ... let's be honest, if you had a private villa in Italy you wouldn't be dickin' around here with us plebians would you? No you wouldn't. You'd have rich people things going on, like psychologically destroying your live-in personal chef for trying to slip real cheese into your grilled cheese sandwiches unnoticed. *WTF!? IS THIS CHEDDAR!? Goddamnit Francesco are you stupid or deaf you moron!? I said KRAFT cheese slices m'fer! It's no wonder your only vacation home is in Malibu you peasant!*\n\nOk ... where was I? Ohh... right. So let's recap. Here's what we've established so far. Phiz is influencial, he spends a lot of his own money to make things and do things that are fun for you that also grow and support the entire ethereum ecosystem. Despite clearly being genetically superior to all of us, he's still human and thus constrained by the same universal laws of the physical universe that we are. That means if you want him to focus his time on you, your product or your service he deserves to be paid for that time. He is after all giving up what he loves most ... you know ... belittling the help for honest mistakes made as the result of his poor, unclear instructions and their unnerving lack of mind reading abilities. So ... I want to be clear when I say there is nothing wrong with Phiz or anyone here taking money from a private company to learn about a free, open source product... as long as you disclose that relationship CLEARLY. IMO. \n\nSo ... with all that said, I want to thank Phiz himself because he: \n\n1. Immediately came forward and disclosed that he is being remunerated by EY.\n2. Offered details and explanations into the terms of remuneration well beyond what he should expected to.\n2. Addressed concerns about his potential conflicts of interest in public.\n3. CLEARLY stated his intentions regarding the products and company he is being paid for.\n\nHey ... I know it appears that Phiz \"sold out\" to a mega-corp, but here's something you should know about Phiz ... he's really afraid of ruining his image & name for the sake of profit. Like deathly afraid. I also want to point out that 99.95% of you here will never be in a position to be influenced by Phiz to purchase products or services from EY. These products are not for you. They're for corpos with high-rise corner offices and shoes that cost more than most houses. Basically, not us. Those folks aren't exactly in Phiz's sphere of influence yet are they? Well ... not yet anyway eh Phiz? So really ... there's nothing for Phiz to sell you. There's no token. No fancy ad campaigns. No hollywood star endorsement. No shipping and handling charges. Really there's no measurable financial incentive for EY to do this AT ALL.\n\nSo here's how I see it. Paul Brody, a long standing member of this community, and a good man with his heart in the right place, as well as one of the first vocal proponents for the adoption of not just blockchain technology in business sytems, but the public Ethereum chain. Since DAY ONE. He has graciously offered SuperPhiz some KRAFT cheese slices in exchange for his time. Hey ... I know how this looks when you break it down semantically... but I genuinely don't believe any of this was diobolically concieved to sell us Nightfall coffee mugs and *Brody's Roadies* T-Shirts. I believe it was offered so that Phiz can spend his very valuable time learning about these amazing technologies so he can teach all of us about them for FREE. Win/win/win.\n\nPersonally? I like this. A lot.
