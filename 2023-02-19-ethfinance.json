This has been the design since the fire eyes tokenomics of 2020 or whenever. The oracle DAO are about 16 nodes who monitor the creation of new minipools on Rocket Pool to determine if they are valid minipools, if they are valid pools, then they connect 16 Ether from the deposit pool with an operator, and the operator runs a minipool. By the tokenomics design and smart contract implementation, the odao gets something like 15% of RPL emissions, equally split between them. The platform needs this screening process and it's wise to choose aligned actors who want to decentralize the chain to oversee the process in a maximally-decentralized (albeit centralized) way. The odao is not limited in size, and I have advocated internally and externally for it to grow to a more representative size.\n\nHere's the magic - When the home operator spins up a minipool, it's an individual contract that they have complete ownership over. This is the decentralization feature of Rocket Pool - that minipools are independently operated validators controlled solely by the node operator with no ongoing intervention from Rocket Pool EXCEPT that they abide by the smart contract rules in the original agreement when the minipool was created. To give nuance, this means that after a minipool/validator is created, Rocket Pool could completely disappear and that operator could continue to run the validator  forever as an independent entity. THIS is why Rocket Pool is decentralized, it really has very little to do with the RPL token, except that the RPL token is built into the rewards tokenomics. \n\nThe RPL token has been around for years, I have them because I've been obsessed with any project who will bring greater decentralization to Ethereum (on a similar note, I'm also interested in stakewise right now).

It doesn't hurt that I've been good friends with Patricio Worthalter for plenty of years and we both share an interest in Ethereum becoming a highly robust platform - Patricio does it from an investing angle and I do it from a community development angle.\n\nSo anyway, the RPL token is something I participate in, but not something I lose sleep over or would even encourage anyone to buy (I do encourage people to hold rEth because it's a valuable Eth derivative). It is a pretty neat twist of events that it has become valuable, and I do sell my excess to cover living expenses, I don't have any shame in that - it's a market and I'm a participant. \n\nIn regard to the oDAO, the current design of the system is that a trusted party needs to do a few jobs, the only one I really care about is \"scrubbing\", this is the process of looking at new minipool contracts and saying, \"Are they legit, do they follow the rules of the protocol?\" Then it green lights them to receive 16 Ether (deposited in exchange for rEth) if they are.  When I committed to run the oracle node a few years ago Rocket Pool was something like $2, so I really had no expectation that it would work out like this. \n\nThe odao system is an effective gatekeeper for the network right now, and I do tend to agree that the payment is excessive, but my personal belief is that the correct way to align the payment is to include more odao members to further decentralize this vetting/scrubbing process.

I think the only change here is that an uninformed person has suggested that &quot;Rocket Pool is centralized&quot; because the odao gets a high emission payout and that&#39;s just an unrealistic leap. If we received 5 RPL for the job, Rocket Pool would be no more or less decentralized. I&#39;ll be very honest, no one cared about this stuff when RPL was $0.29, but now that it&#39;s successful everyone wants to point fingers, it smells a bit like greed or jealousy to me, and that&#39;s not something I need to worry myself with.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr: Rocket Pool minipools are fully decentralized, RPL not so much, but that&#39;s inconsequential.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-19 06:11:11","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-02-19 06:33:33","id":"j95v0jh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11632qy","parent_id":"t1_j95nf86","score":62,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/5dayoldburrito","body":"Hey superphiz, so the oDAO has a fixed budget for its members?
