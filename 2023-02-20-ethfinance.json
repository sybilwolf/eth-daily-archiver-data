I think everything connected to the merge (less issuance compared to PoW, tripple halving etc.) and 1559 will work as we expect it to work out, but right it is also basically still \"alpha\". It's both a nice meme and obviously also a strong change in fundamentals, but especially the ultrasound money meme is probably still only something a niche in the market knows/ understands. It's not bringing in any new or at least not enough new money to kickstart a bull run. At the same time it's also not burning enough ETH so that the change in supply *really* changes the picture. \n\nThe changes that came with the merge have had more or less 6 months (158 days according to [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money)) to manifest and as stated I am pretty sure that these play an important role for price, the ratio has held up pretty nicely the last months. \n\nRight now we have burned about 30k since the merge and about 42k from peak. This is obviously a nice add-on, but compared to the changes connected to the merge these numbers are irrelevant (triple halving = 87,5% reduction in newly issued ETH = more or less 10k/ day less. 2k/ day in the last 7 days, so the 1559 burn only adds 20% on top). \n\nNow I understand people that say \"Bearnido, please be more patient\", especially 1559 changes are only coming into play now, since on-chain activity is better than the first 5 months after the merge. But I think there's one thing that's missing: a \"real\" meme. As in: Not just a niche thing, but something that everyone understands, like for example the BTC halving.

This is obviously only one example = sample size of 1, I get that, but my gut tells me what DegenSpartan describes is still a likely reality)\n\nThe BTC meme has been growing for more than one cycle and has been pumped by \"add-ons\" like the stock 2 flow meme, that was very popular. ETH - and I think for many reasons - is not close to reaching a similar position. E.g. the community doesn't like memes as much (because ETH doesn't need memes, cause fundamentals). ETH is younger and has had less time. \n\nSo what do we need? Something needs to change and obviously there are a lot events that could drive interest back. \n\n* Macro --> risk on assets more attractive \n* BTC halving meme in 24\n* A first crypto super app (leading to more on chain activity --> higher burn)\n* 4844 + L2 season (leading to more on chain activity --> higher burn, not via L2 usage, but more general interest that then spills over to L1)\n* ... \n\nThe thing is, the first two will most likely result in BTC pumping first, ETH catching up later on --> when people understand what ETH is and how it works. And I think those are the most likely reasons, sadly.\n\nIs this bad? Of course it isn't! And of course there is a chance that on chain activity grows without any new events, defi summer 2.0 etc. and ETH just catches up. I just think that chance is rather low. It's IMO just more likely crypto as a market grows again, BTC leads the charge, people invest more time to find \"more than BTC\", understand ETH... and then tradfi people get a boner, buy our bags and we finally flip BTC because just then ultrasound money develops the real memetic value we all see today.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I made a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1158cdi/daily_general_discussion_february_18_2023/j90olqm/?context=3\">short post on the weekend</a> and I would like to follow up with some more detailed thoughts and explanations with regards to the post: </p>\n\n<p>Basically my hypothesis is &quot;the merge is nice (see ratio in bear) but no strong enough to move all markets and let ETH start a bull run&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Let me start with: I obviously believe in ETH! I think everything connected to the merge (less issuance compared to PoW, tripple halving etc.) and 1559 will work as we expect it to work out, but right it is also basically still &quot;alpha&quot;. It&#39;s both a nice meme and obviously also a strong change in fundamentals, but especially the ultrasound money meme is probably still only something a niche in the market knows/ understands. It&#39;s not bringing in any new or at least not enough new money to kickstart a bull run. At the same time it&#39;s also not burning enough ETH so that the change in supply <em>really</em> changes the picture. </p>\n\n<p>The changes that came with the merge have had more or less 6 months (158 days according to <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money\">ultrasound.money</a>) to manifest and as stated I am pretty sure that these play an important role for price, the ratio has held up pretty nicely the last months. </p>\n\n<p>Right now we have burned about 30k since the merge and about 42k from peak. This is obviously a nice add-on, but compared to the changes connected to the merge these numbers are irrelevant (triple halving = 87,5% reduction in newly issued ETH = more or less 10k/ day less. 2k/ day in the last 7 days, so the 1559 burn only adds 20% on top). </p>\n\n<p>Now I understand people that say &quot;Bearnido, please be more patient&quot;, especially 1559 changes are only coming into play now, since on-chain activity is better than the first 5 months after the merge. But I think there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s missing: a &quot;real&quot; meme. As in: Not just a niche thing, but something that everyone understands, like for example the BTC halving.

And you're right that, at the very least, there is a revolving door contagion problem between government, quasi-government (like rating agencies) and economists. \n\nBut I think just restricting it to a simply two way government -------- economists relationship makes the picture far too simple. \n\nFor instance the vast majority of research economists are employed in the public sector, generally by think tanks and institutes that are owned by massive firms or ultra rich people. \n\nNow the relationship between these three (gov/firms/economists) has the opposite causality of what you describe. Economists are employed by private firms (and hence a bias in their benefit) which take the results from those economists and then push it unto the government though lobbying (and also revolving doors). \n\nSo by just expanding the view to account for private actors we can easily deduct that while governments probably Influence economists, firms influence over governments are significantly larger, and economists are then beholden to said firms. \n\nIf we then start to look to the publically employed economists, then we something even further interesting. Namely that universities tend to prefer to higher unorthodox economists, precisely because they fear the government-private firms bias effect. (And this is why I brought up the universality about deflation among economists, because even those that are effectively blackballed from both private firms and government policy, like many chicagoans and all MMTers, agree on it).\n\n\n\nSo then the picture is even more muddied. \n\nThis is also while entirely discounting the internal drive of economists themselves. \n\nEven if we assume that 99% of them are profit driven machines, there would still be dissident economists that would shout from the rooftops that the consensus is wrong. \n\nWe already have this with still present and active socialist economists employed by universities that proclaim that essentially everything of economics beyond supply and demand is wrong.

And you&#39;re right that, at the very least, there is a revolving door contagion problem between government, quasi-government (like rating agencies) and economists. </p>\n\n<p>But I think just restricting it to a simply two way government -------- economists relationship makes the picture far too simple. </p>\n\n<p>For instance the vast majority of research economists are employed in the public sector, generally by think tanks and institutes that are owned by massive firms or ultra rich people. </p>\n\n<p>Now the relationship between these three (gov/firms/economists) has the opposite causality of what you describe. Economists are employed by private firms (and hence a bias in their benefit) which take the results from those economists and then push it unto the government though lobbying (and also revolving doors). </p>\n\n<p>So by just expanding the view to account for private actors we can easily deduct that while governments probably Influence economists, firms influence over governments are significantly larger, and economists are then beholden to said firms. </p>\n\n<p>If we then start to look to the publically employed economists, then we something even further interesting. Namely that universities tend to prefer to higher unorthodox economists, precisely because they fear the government-private firms bias effect. (And this is why I brought up the universality about deflation among economists, because even those that are effectively blackballed from both private firms and government policy, like many chicagoans and all MMTers, agree on it).</p>\n\n<p>So then the picture is even more muddied. </p>\n\n<p>This is also while entirely discounting the internal drive of economists themselves. </p>\n\n<p>Even if we assume that 99% of them are profit driven machines, there would still be dissident economists that would shout from the rooftops that the consensus is wrong. </p>\n\n<p>We already have this with still present and active socialist economists employed by universities that proclaim that essentially everything of economics beyond supply and demand is wrong.
