I think it&#39;s pretty cringe to squat on a shitload of names anyway so thankfully I didn&#39;t go overboard.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>After this experience I realized the only reason someone would pay a large chunk of ETH for an ENS name (other than flipping it) is if they actually happen to be the one of the few entities in the entire world who would actually pay a decent amount of money for it, which is extremely unlikely in the majority of cases.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m working on a brand and I wanted to get an ENS name for our crowdfunding project.

Then I checked the registration fee every day until it dropped to a price I could actually afford. Just hours before, some squatter sniped the ENS name.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Man almost immediately listed it on OpenSea for 2.69 ETH for a month. Of course no one bought it lol. The guy is an NFT whale and has over 100 ENS domains, of which he constantly lists and unlists at absurd prices (like for hundreds or thousands of ETH) and then cancelling them. I&#39;ve been stalking the guy a bit on social media, and on his twitter he was saying something like  &quot;I managed to get a few first name ENS names and I&#39;m listing them for only 4 ETH each, you won&#39;t see prices like this again!!
