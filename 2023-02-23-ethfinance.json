Hey! Where ya going? It's totally free! Ah fine! I'll just talk to myself as usual! So John, like I was saying I have a bunch of cool stuff going on with Caches rn. You don't say John ... ohhh but I *do say* John!\n\nSo like first, today someone submitted a post to the community blog over here. This time I don't know who it is! It's not RoofTop, it's not me, it's not a post stolen from Reddit ... it's someone named Automaton! What's really cool is they said that my online guides to subterfuge inspired them to write their post for Caches! It's like the stigmergy is working! The post is about creating a [personal online threat model](https://caches.xyz/the-rostrum/creating-an-online-threat-model-best-practices-for-personal-opsec/). It's short, but there's some great info in there! They also had amazing formatting, grammar, spelling and hyperlinks that I didn't have to fix up hardly at all. So to Mister, Misses or Themster Automaton ... thank you for your contribution and support whoever you are homie!\n\nNextily, I added a cool feature last week. The #degen-chat group was still using Google sheets *ewwww nasty!* to store their links and notes. My EVMs?! Using a Google product!? Awwwhhh hell no son! So I added a new feature to Caches for you and your groups. They're called collaborative docs and you can find them under the \"Collab\" tab on your personal profile, and in your groups. Collaborative docs allow you to create simple documents, including tabled content, that you can share and collaborate on with whoever you choose! It's like a collaborative Word document!\n\nThere's a full version history, with ability to see the differences between versions, who made what changes and one click to roll back to a previous version! They also have the ability to add attachments, sort them into folders and set permissions on who can read and edit them too! Sort of like a private Wiki. Well wouldn'cha just know it... those degens took to it like a Phiz to a POAP and created a spreadsheet style document in the hidden EVM Holders Only group ... yeah ... if you don't have an EVM in the wallet you sign into Caches with, you can't even see it! EVM or not, this feature is now available to every member and every group on Caches!\n\nFor the grande finale of this post, I added some new badges for people with certain NFT's in their wallet. Of course I've always had the crown badge for EVMs, and late last year I added an EIPanda badge, now I've added one for those of us playing the Layer 0 \"rug\" game on Discord too! You can check it out on [my profile page at caches](https://caches.xyz/members/d75c89ff27c9ba5a/collab-docs/) below my username. Nice right? Well I didn't stop there, I also added one just for that sexy ass mofo *The Ben Meadows* too. Yeah, Ben got his own special Ben Badge. Check out the TBM badge on [his profile page at caches](https://caches.xyz/members/a4f3aa3ba639ff93/). Hahaha! Inceptiben! You are the best Mr. Meadows!\n\nLook ... don't feel left out. If you have a community NFT, I will add a badge for your members too! All I need is an ERC20 or ERC721 contract address and I can make it happen. Then all you have to do is login to Caches with a wallet with that NFT and boom! You're official! I have a huge amount of badge icons available to choose from no matter what your group is about! Now you can easily tell who's the real *The Ben Meadows* and who's just a fake bot with the same profile pic and you don't have to pay me or expose your identity to me or anyone else! No EVM? No EIP? No L0? No TBM!? THAT'S NOT SEXY THE BEN MEADOWS! LET'S GET HIM! BURN THIS IMPOSTER AT THE STAKE!\n\nAhhhh... I love a good witch hunt, been a minute... *sigh* ... Welp, alright then John, good talk.

For gtcETH token holders, the annualized streaming fee of 2.00% (1.75% for the Gitcoin DAO and 0.25% for Index Coop) is collected in a passive fashion, so aside from buying and holding the token, gtcETH holders don\u2019t have to do anything to earn staking rewards for themselves and fund public goods. For Gitcoin, gtcETH provides a consistent, subscription-like revenue stream for funding grants and/or bounties as well as a low-friction access point for contributions. gtcETH also provides a positive-sum option for those considering donations because token holders retain price exposure to ETH and earn some staking rewards while simultaneously donating to public goods (versus an outright donation where the user must forfeit their ETH).&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>This has been in the works for a while - we&#39;re all really excited for it to go live. Assuming a constant ETH price of $1700, a TVL of $1m would contribute ~$17,500 annually to Gitcoin Grants earning gtcETH a top ten spot in Gitcoin&#39;s <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/leaderboard/payers?cadence=quarterly&amp;keyword=&amp;product=all\">Funders Leaderboard</a> (while also earning holders the net staking rate themselves)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-23 03:48:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j9o8vjv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_119q5kg","parent_id":"t3_119q5kg","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/MrVodnik","body":">0.25% for Index Coop\n\nYou've lost me there.
