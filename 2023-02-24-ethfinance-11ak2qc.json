In particular, a key goal is to help provide the push it takes to get a passive MKR holder to begin participating, by e.g. participating in sourcecred on the forum. By empowering the old guard and drawing newcomers into the core of the community, all other stakeholders will also see indirect benefits, including traders and end users, because the overall quality and value of the project depends on the core community members and good governance. Additionally, the Sagittarius Engine also has a powerful \u201cburn-like\u201d effect as it locks up and remove large amounts of MKR in a short amount of time.\n\nThis is achieved through a novel design that is inspired by the most successful tokenomics models in DeFi, including Curve, Sushiswap and Synthetix. **The basic concept is that the Sagittarius engine gathers the cash flows of the protocol into a capital pool called a Bucket, which is then used to offer long term MKR holders the ability to borrow Dai from the Bucket using their MKR as collateral at a 0% rate, fixed forever, and with preferential liquidation (a very long grace period).**\n\n**This approach to borrowing Dai from Maker based on MKR collateral does NOT create solvency or collateral risk issues for Dai, because the Dai is NOT \u201cfreshly generated\u201d, but rather it was previously generated and then accumulated into the Bucket (The protocol owned capital pool) and is thus guaranteed to be overcollateralized by hard assets just like any other Dai. The locked MKR that is used as collateral is not being used to back the Dai.**\n\nTo be able to access this benefit MKR holders need to lock up their MKR between 1-4 years, where a longer lockup gives access to a proportionally greater share of the benefit of being able to borrow Dai at beneficial rates - manifesting in a higher Debt Limit Growth rate which has some similarity to an APR by determining how much cash the user can borrow per day at the beneficial rate. Additionally, locking up MKR this way also increases the voting power of the locked MKR by up to 2x, helping to better align governance decisions with the will of voters that are verifiably exposed to their consequences for the long run.\"\n\nSource: [https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sagittarius-engine/10852](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sagittarius-engine/10852)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>&quot;The goal of the Sagittarius Engine is to better direct the value flows of the Maker Protocol towards long term governance participants - the core of MKR holders that participate based on genuine interest in the project and its potential. In particular, a key goal is to help provide the push it takes to get a passive MKR holder to begin participating, by e.g. participating in sourcecred on the forum. By empowering the old guard and drawing newcomers into the core of the community, all other stakeholders will also see indirect benefits, including traders and end users, because the overall quality and value of the project depends on the core community members and good governance. Additionally, the Sagittarius Engine also has a powerful \u201cburn-like\u201d effect as it locks up and remove large amounts of MKR in a short amount of time.</p>\n\n<p>This is achieved through a novel design that is inspired by the most successful tokenomics models in DeFi, including Curve, Sushiswap and Synthetix. <strong>The basic concept is that the Sagittarius engine gathers the cash flows of the protocol into a capital pool called a Bucket, which is then used to offer long term MKR holders the ability to borrow Dai from the Bucket using their MKR as collateral at a 0% rate, fixed forever, and with preferential liquidation (a very long grace period).</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This approach to borrowing Dai from Maker based on MKR collateral does NOT create solvency or collateral risk issues for Dai, because the Dai is NOT \u201cfreshly generated\u201d, but rather it was previously generated and then accumulated into the Bucket (The protocol owned capital pool) and is thus guaranteed to be overcollateralized by hard assets just like any other Dai. The locked MKR that is used as collateral is not being used to back the Dai.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To be able to access this benefit MKR holders need to lock up their MKR between 1-4 years, where a longer lockup gives access to a proportionally greater share of the benefit of being able to borrow Dai at beneficial rates - manifesting in a higher Debt Limit Growth rate which has some similarity to an APR by determining how much cash the user can borrow per day at the beneficial rate. Additionally, locking up MKR this way also increases the voting power of the locked MKR by up to 2x, helping to better align governance decisions with the will of voters that are verifiably exposed to their consequences for the long run.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sagittarius-engine/10852\">https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sagittarius-engine/10852</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-25 10:18:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j9zf2hf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11ak2qc","parent_id":"t1_j9xw5x3","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"Thank you for correcting my understanding of that.\n\nI would argue that the documentation at endgame.makerdao.com is misleadingly worded.
