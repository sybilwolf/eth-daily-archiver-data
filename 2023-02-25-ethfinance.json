I personally would have been interested in some more of the behind-the-scenes about what it takes to form a Wyoming DAO (and why to do so) and organize a group vacation while maintaining participant pseudonymity, but the conference organizers surprised them last minute with this day-1 timeslot so I know there were some serious time constraints.\n* [Brian Wilkes](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/fbd6c346-8883-4ed6-9220-68bc17f4770e/c32b46bc-57e5-4fe0-b3df-500718789823) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=5h2m43s)) gave a nice overview of zero knowledge proofs as applied to Ethereum scaling.

There are some good general insights into DAO structure and operation that I found myself able to relate to the EVMavericks DAO. Some of his main lessons: be clear about your governance process, don't try to figure out too much ahead of time, keep open and transparent communication, leadership and hierarchy can exist but should be delegated (and can be revoked) by the community.\n\nOn a personal note, it's kind of amazing how much I expect my experience at ETHDenver will be different this year.

I have [a project](https://www.aestus.live/) that I can explain to people who ask what I've been working on (and they seem to find it very interesting (!), but I need to stop assuming that everyone knows how staking and MEV work). I tentatively have a hackathon team (with folks from this community) for a project I think will be bite-sized but still quite valuable. And I need to juggle driving back home occasionally for some classes I'm taking, so I've accepted I'm going to have limited free time this next week. But it'll just be packed so full of fun things!\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, I also have the EVMavericks t-shirts for those who signed up on Discord.

They do their job to earn money. Our ideal validator who runs his own machine at home with a few validators but not to many and does so for the good of the ecosystem, is an exception.   \n\nWe see that (just like with mining) pools are dominating the staking world. It's definitely better than with PoW, but we can [clearly see](https://beaconcha.in/pools#distribution) that pools are dominating the space. And to be honest, I think it'll get worse.  \n\nIn the future I'll see staking getting more institutionalized. Just like coinbase, kraken & co are doing now, you don't want to have exposure to ETH when offering a staking service. You're simply doing the job that a staker is supposed to do (validating, ensuring high uptime, etc.), the ETH will provided by someone else.     \n\nYou could even do this more decentralized. Imaging something like rocketpool but instead of the validator having to post ETH as their bond, they use a stable coin. They have no exposure to the underlying asset but earn money by staking.

In that case 2023 will be a great year for ETH hodlers in the long run when we look back a couple of years down the road.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thing that might happen #2:</strong> All LSDs <em>which are not LIDO</em> moon. I can\u2019t imagine LIDO staking stake stays the same post-Shanghai. All they ever had was the first mover advantage, and post-unlock that should dissipate and we should have a more equal playground</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thing that might happen #3:</strong> LSDs do not moon, but gradually increase in value as their respective TVLs grow over the next 6-12 months. This means they might even dump post-Shanghai as TTMH #2 from above does not play out. Could be another great entry point for those on the sidelines of LSDs</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All-in-all it seems that the LSD potential will most likely outweigh whatever short term loss we endure from the ETH selling pressure. Could be a couple of red weeks (or months) but it seems quite optimistic on the long run.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think? Which one of the above seems more likely, or are there obvious things I missed?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-25 06:17:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j9yghlj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11bdlrh","parent_id":"t3_11bdlrh","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Imelia29","body":"Do you think the removal of the risk of your funds getting stuck in the staking contract will get more funds to move into staking once withdrawals are active?
