More importantly, the Department of Justice described [ETH as a commodity in a recent SBF related filing](https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1628776537385320448). \n\nProbably the first time the DoJ has claimed ETH as a commodity, which is a big deal. Why? Because its well known that Gary has political ambitions, and wants to run for Treasury secretary (or other high ranking White House position) under the next Dem president. If Gary were to declare ETH a security, he would directly contradict the Biden Administration's DoJ, and Gary is enough of a weasel to know that's not a great way to curry political favour. In addition, while an agency making a declaration isn't legal law per se, the US government still can be viewed as a singular body by an American investor or builder, and each time some body of government declares ETH a commodity, it just makes it harder for the SEC to just make a completely different statment and ask a judge to ignore all those years of prior declarations by sister branches of the US government (not impossible, just harder).\n\nDo I think the SEC would come out and declare ETH as *not* a security? Not anytime soon, like probably not for the next 5 years even. Because as soon as you do that, you would have a deluge of projects which would release new tokens and raising funds using the ETH ruling as guidance, to stay just within the rules of being a commodity. I don't think the administration wants that. ETH would be formally declared a commodity and out of their purview by the SEC only after there is new legislation passed by congress which specifies how digital tokens are regulated, and I don't see that happening for half a decade or longer. So we would have to live with the regulatory uncertainty, and regular fud by Big Government Bitcoiners, for now.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Quite a few different comments on securites and eth (again).

Why? Because its well known that Gary has political ambitions, and wants to run for Treasury secretary (or other high ranking White House position) under the next Dem president. If Gary were to declare ETH a security, he would directly contradict the Biden Administration&#39;s DoJ, and Gary is enough of a weasel to know that&#39;s not a great way to curry political favour. In addition, while an agency making a declaration isn&#39;t legal law per se, the US government still can be viewed as a singular body by an American investor or builder, and each time some body of government declares ETH a commodity, it just makes it harder for the SEC to just make a completely different statment and ask a judge to ignore all those years of prior declarations by sister branches of the US government (not impossible, just harder).</p>\n\n<p>Do I think the SEC would come out and declare ETH as <em>not</em> a security? Not anytime soon, like probably not for the next 5 years even. Because as soon as you do that, you would have a deluge of projects which would release new tokens and raising funds using the ETH ruling as guidance, to stay just within the rules of being a commodity. I don&#39;t think the administration wants that. ETH would be formally declared a commodity and out of their purview by the SEC only after there is new legislation passed by congress which specifies how digital tokens are regulated, and I don&#39;t see that happening for half a decade or longer. So we would have to live with the regulatory uncertainty, and regular fud by Big Government Bitcoiners, for now.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-26 04:53:12","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-02-26 04:56:35","id":"ja2uogz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11c6vcs","parent_id":"t3_11c6vcs","score":40,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Ber10","body":"CFTC Chairmen called trice that Ether is a commodity now the DOJ and the SEC hinman speech that was personal opinion but officially informed by Hinmans division and somehow semi official according to the SEC. \n\nAnd ofcourse Eth is simply not a security.

So there are two ways of  calculating profit from holders or stakers point of view:\n\nFrom the holders point of view profit is fees from burned basefee minus issuance.\n\nFrom the stakers point of view it's staking rewards (from issuance and tips/MEV), plus fees from burned basefee, minus issuance, minus staking operating costs.\n\nThe stakers don't need deflation to be profitable because since there is always some ETH not staked the issuance they receive is higher than what they lose from dilution from the global issuance. And also the expenses to stake are pretty low.\n\nIn a situation where most of ETH is staked then staking rewards from issuance and global issuance would cancel each other out. Then the profit would be fees (burned basefee and tips/MEV) minus staking costs.\n\nBut we're still far from this (only around 15% staked for now) so when talking about the \"Ethereum Network\" profit it's mostly from the holders point of view.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAs an investor it means that there are two ways to calculate PE with the stakers way always giving a better number as long as not all ETH is staked.\n\nThe situation is similar to when there are several funds investing in the same index but they have different expenses/fees and some funds can also earn more by lending shares, etc. Then the returns end up being different for each fund.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>While holders can relatively easily become stakers they are still separate categories.
