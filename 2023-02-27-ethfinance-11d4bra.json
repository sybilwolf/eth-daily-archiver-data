More people in the venue, some talks fill all the seating, and just a general sense of activity. The wifi in the main venue has become nearly useless though. My day was mostly focused on attending talks, which seemed to have a slight theme of ZK tech and infrastructure stuff like L2's and staking protocols. Also, seems like the Twitch stream for the main stage only caught one talk? I've checked their 8 (yes, 8) Twitch channels but can't find the rest of today's talks, so won't be linking them. Too bad, I wanted to rewatch a couple talks I only caught part of.\n\n* [0xFornax, a Rocket Pool community member](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/8a2d0669-434d-43b3-8c5d-4a16d701c131/50b45a7c-4e34-4be0-9cad-fc2a36ed6cd3) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1749843335?t=0h14m45s)), hosted the Rocket Buidlers Workshop, really just a talk about Rocket Pool in general. This may be one of the protocols for which the members of ethfinance have the least need for a broad, introductory video, but it does cover quite a bit. Of interest to RP enthusiasts is discussion about the Atlas upgrade, a demonstration of the Proteus hardware, and some nice diagrams showing some important RP processes step-by-step in detail.\n* [Orest Tarasiuk of Scroll](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/da3cd6fe-d85b-4f62-87c2-321d134c8037/ba05e8a5-60ac-490b-a882-5d46a62f32cb) gave a talk about scaling Ethereum with zero-knowledge proofs. Coming out of the RP talk, I only caught the end of it, but it generally seemed like they were giving an introduction to zkEVMs (potentially covering [Vitalik's classification scheme (maybe?)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html)) and talking about Scroll's roadmap.\n* [Jon Roethke of ChainSafe](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/4596e17f-79c3-462f-a86a-fbe875fc5a48/e549567a-4247-4e98-8dcd-2fb6515ccc9e) talked about their whole ecosystem of tools for web3/blockchain integration into video games. Mainly a Unity SDK that makes it easy to handle in-game ERC-{20,721,1155} tokens and set up marketplaces for players to trade said tokens. They kind of talked big about wanting people to build games from the ground-up with web3 in mind, but then for the one game they demoed they clarified that it had web3 components tacked on after the game was otherwise complete, so while the tooling may be nice I'm still a little skeptical of the use case.\n* [Evan Shapiro, CEO and Co-Founder at the Mina Foundation](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/432d4088-d23c-4842-a4a5-a8f0a1ebd008/416bcbeb-dcf3-4c3d-8673-88d988cfb8cf), explained why ZKPs will be key to the web3 user experience. Or at least that's what the website says. When he was giving a boring basic explanation of what a ZK proof is (like every other ZK talk feels like they have to do), my body decided it was nap time and I missed most of it. Ugh, this could have been interesting. So instead let me briefly describe Mina: I don't follow the team/community/development so it may actually be crap, but according to what I've heard it's [a really interesting alt-L1](https://masked.medium.com/the-coda-protocol-bbcb4b212b13) in that the current state of the chain at any given point in time consists of a single ZK-SNARK that proves that all historical transactions are valid and consensus rules have been followed. Add on a Merkle path to your account info and you have everything you need to fully validate and transact on the chain, in 22 kB. It's a project to at least be aware of.\n* [Chris Battenfield, Head of Product at Obol Labs](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/53e5845f-97df-4021-a4d5-8219b59dedbd/2bbff17d-f802-4046-af13-6764283d9737), gave a general overview of DVT and Obol. If you're not already familiar with distributed validator technology, you may want to catch up; Obol and other DVT platforms are moving towards mainnet and will be increasingly important to the Ethereum staking landscape soon enough. For those with some background, Chris talked about Obol's current progress through their roadmap, the results of some of their recent tests (e.g. higher performance compared to solo stakers, and a [pilot with Lido](https://blog.lido.fi/dvt-pilot-with-obol-network/)), and their plans as they prepare for mainnet.\n* In part of [a workshop on pioneering use cases of ZK tech](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/40876489-be28-45a6-939a-595b7bf5c3ef/9bece490-1f71-4346-9d73-0e0e050be013), a few teams gave lightning talks on their projects, followed by a general Q&A panel on their thoughts on ZK stuff.\n  - Shady El Damaty, Co-Founder of Holonym ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1749843335?t=4h14m26s)), talked about private identity verification on public blockchains. Holonym seems to me like a step towards the overall vision of soulbound tokens, obscured behind zero-knowledge proofs, being used to prove certain credentials or provide Sybil resistance without revealing any other information. Will be curious to see if it works as advertised and sees much adoption.\n  - Vince (?), Co-Founder of zkLink ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1749843335?t=4h25m22s)), described their L2 platform. zkLink is a multi-chain, app-specific ZK-rollup designed for trading. I hadn't heard of a multi-chain rollup before, but for me it's one of those things that seems obvious once you realize it. There's no reason why a ZK-rollup can't accept deposits from multiple chains, combine the state in the L2, and allow trading to occur between assets on the disparate chains. If I'm understanding it right, as long as users are able to exit their funds at will, it sidesteps some of the serious issues with bridges, allowing cross-chain trading to occur without assets really \"leaving\" their native chain.\n  - Balal (?), Co-Founder of ZKEX ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1749843335?t=4h37m5s)), further explained the ZKEX exchange, built on top of zkLink. Advertised as a DEX with a CEX-like experience, like an order book design, leverage, and derivatives. Somehow they're also working with zkSync and StarkNet, not quite sure how but depending on what it is ZKEX may be a kind of an L3, which would explain why they can get such a user-friendly UX.\n* [Marcin Ka\u017amierczak, COO at RedStone](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/b4fbf382-4eef-4e0f-952f-54824628e572/8d9e1b44-38dd-4e2c-a41f-505a4727e11d), gave a talk on their on-demand oracles. I don't know a ton about oracle operation, but it seems RedStone has an interesting system in which a user who wants to perform a TX that depends on an up-to-date oracle value first goes to RedStone off chain in order to request the most recent data, get it pre-processed and signed, and then passed along with their TX as calldata, updating the on-chain oracle in the process. In doing so, the oracle is only updated on-demand when needed for a TX.\n\nSo as you can see from the above wall of text, there are a lot more talks now.

I wanted to brain dump some musings that hopefully can spark some good thoughts/discussion. After starting to write, I realized there\u2019s a lot I wanted to touch on, so I broke my post into multiple parts and here I\u2019ll just touch on just the broader crypto trends bear over bear. Feel free to push back/share thoughts.\r\n\r\nOverall, the perception of crypto and Ethereum has changed and progressed immensely for the better over the last few years. All of the 2018-2020 BUIDLing, both at the base and app layers, yielded us the 2021 hypefest in NFTs, staking (mostly shitcoins and ponzicoins), DeFi, and DAOs. Comparatively, I see much less significant \u201cinnovative\u201d changes/releases in 2021-3 than I did during 2018-20 (but still enough to get me continually excited, in all major sectors: L1, DeFi, NFTs, L2s, DAOs, gaming, social media). Though, in general, the foundation has been laid and now it\u2019s about incrementally increases to the prior major leaps, which include things like user accessibility/feature sets. I think the changes now are more focused on UI/UX and thinking creatively with how to use tokens and mechanics that were created and implemented in 2018-20 (many of which were outlined in the Ethereum whitepaper, which is amazing to me). Also, as a side note and subset of UX/UI gains, I was very glad to see massive Devcon Bogota hype around things like account abstraction, which is still significantly slept on in terms of something that will drive exponential user adoption in the coming years. This hype has died down now, but you better believe that AA is just as important to onboarding the next wave of users than NFTs were in 2021. There was always minor talk about it from Ethereum\u2019s inception to 2020, but it\u2019s never been a central hypefest and focus like I\u2019ve seen at ETH Bogota (I was also glad to see Coinbase mention it as a feature in their blog post). I\u2019m excited about danksharding too, but in my opinion, AA should be getting similar consistent hype.\r\n\r\nReflecting on the prior bull, even though I think the non-ethfinance world woke up a bit, they merely realized a sliver of Ethereum\u2019s potential in 2021. Yes we saw traditional banks putting out DeFi slide decks and previous-ETH-bears-turned-Twitter-ETH grifters getting bullish on Ethereum, DeFi and NFTs in 2021, but on the whole they still don\u2019t fully grasp the scope of what Ethereum enables nor do they realize the tokenomics of ETH in relation to traditional assets (and thus nor do their more mainstream crypto followers and obviously still the majority nocoiner crowd). It\u2019s ok though. Baby steps, and I believe they still will more and more in time.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important shifts in general Ethereum knowledge and understanding from the prior bull throughout the broader population is simply this: that Ethereum and crypto isn\u2019t purely a scam. Yes, mainstream still thinks this in the general sense, but overall they somewhat realize that \u201ccrypto\u201d and \u201cblockchains\u2019 can do things like enable apps. They also now vaguely realize that Ethereum is a platform that provides things like artist, music, and gaming applications with NFTs, financial apps with DeFi and organizational tools with DAOs through magic pixie dust magic called tokens. This shift is so significant yet subtle that even the new bulls from the 2020 COVID DeFi summer season and 2021 bull don\u2019t realize how exponential things have become in relation to those \u201cold days\u201d on the general education and understanding front. The users that\u2019s formed and stuck in the ecosystem in 2022-now is going to provide the base for a 96-00 internet style gains to user adoption, knowledge, and belief in Ethereum over the coming years. Despite macro worries and general fuckery going on in the non-Ethereum world (which I think still will take more time to work itself out), Ethereum will continue growing. Corporations have all been forced to  consider/discuss a crypto strategy, simply because it makes financial sense for them (the incentives align). We\u2019ve gone from a time where /r/cryptocurrency was calling ETH a shitcoin and CT being a group of a few hundred hardcore believer nerds yelling into the internet void to thousands upon tens of thousands of people all seeing a sliver of Ethereum and ETH\u2019s utility. Another massive shift and upgrade has been the fact that we now have actual Etheruem-focused content creators on Youtube, Twitter, and other social medias (remember when next to no one was doing it and more or less the only way to get Ethereum information was if you really tried, by reading whitepapers, GitHub and ethmagicians, and watching Ethereum conference videos, etc? I still think these are some of the best ways to learn, but for the more passive Ethereum crowds who want information funneled to them, this is huge and I\u2019m happy to see it flourish and continue growing). The information streams and access has generally increased, and the next wave will be even more significant than 2021, as all of Ethereum\u2019s current and future offerings become greater and more feature rich, and more easy to access along with more mainstream accepted corporations and such plugging into our beloved protocols, offering their customers Ethereum access whether they resize it or not. Overall, we\u2019re long away from the days where only 3 or 4 important things happened a year and we were invisible to mainstream media (another point that I\u2019ll touch on later).\r\n\r\nTo my 2020+ friends, yes things were gloomy in 2022 and now in relation to 2021, but if you zoom out further (go back and read the 2016 or 2018-2020 ethtrader and ethfinance dailys), there\u2019s been a significant net gain in general mainstream acceptance and knowledge of Ethereum\u2019s existence and utility, and ETH\u2019s purpose within the ecosystem. I cannot stress this enough. Over time, with the seemingly simple mental shift that Ethereum and all crypto isn\u2019t in fact a scam or useless network, these same people will continue discovering more of what\u2019s possible during future mainstream hype cycles (the simple fact that every govt wants to now regulate rather than ignore crypto is an admission that it\u2019s here for the long haul and something significant), and so will we (thanks to this ecosystem\u2019s brilliant researchers, and Ethereum\u2019s programmability that forever unlocks an unknown sea of infinite creation). RIP Bitcoin = crypto narratives and the days when Ethereum couldn\u2019t crack a mainstream news article\u2019s headline.\r\n\r\nI bring all of this up because it\u2019s important to realize what the increased and growing knowledge of all of these things means for Ethereum. It means that new and excited researchers and developers got attracted to this ecosystem and are now here to stay (dev numbers are way up bear over bear, and the diversity of their focus is amazing to see. This will enable multi-dimensional progress on all of Ethereum\u2019s current and future use cases). The same goes for new users (active addresses are up exponentially from last bear) and even the simple investor pool has expanded and increased immensely (RIP 1-5 gwei transaction days).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll end with recirculating Danny Ryan\u2019s recent \u201cReflections 2023\u201d post (/r/djrtwo): https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2023-02-23_2023-Reflections.md\r\n\r\nI think he nails pretty much all that he touches on. As Danny mentioned, he doesn\u2019t touch on every aspect of the ecosystem, but from his perspective, and from the things he\u2019s focused on, he provides some really valuable thoughts to reflect on for the entire space and therefore for this entire sub. For starters, I was surprised at the lack of critique in Ethereum land on the Prysmatic Labs purchase by Arbitrum/Offchain labs, for exactly the reasons Danny discusses, and I\u2019m glad he brought at least some increased awareness to it (I saw a massive lack of discussion, and instead celebration mostly on CT over this purchase\u2014mostly from biased people riding the Arbitrum hype wave hoping for an airdrop and because many don\u2019t realize Prysmatic Labs relationship and importance to the entire Ethereum ecosystem). In general, he presents an incredible thought discussion on issues and concerns relating to coordination (hello Moloch), L1 upgrades, L2\u2019s role, and incentives. I\u2019ve long talked about and been a proponent of ossification of L1, and Danny\u2019s thoughts align with my thinking. One thought I do still have regarding Danny\u2019s L2 rug risk is how wallets and blockchain service providers will play a role in his concerns\u2014specifically, I\u2019ve advocated since Vitalik\u2019s 2019 post on rollups that the L2 centric rollup would be the future of Ethereum (and it\u2019s why I\u2019ve been bearish on the whole Polkadot and alt L1 theories throughout the years, and I\u2019m glad 2021-2 further cemented the L2 ZK hype). ZK tech in theory and now in practice is going to solve all scalability issues and it provides amazing interoperability benefits between L2s in the mid/long term, and so I wonder, as bridges and interoperability play a large role in the future of L2 tech, how wallets and L2 service providers like Coinbase (and eventually all exchanges and traditional banks/brokerages) make their impact on this discussion in terms of providing easy access between L2s, because they will be the gateway control into Ethereum for mainstream users. In particular, how they abstract away the fact that users are interacting on a L2 in the first place via easy bridges in the backend. Last, I\u2019ll end with something Danny summarizes perfectly, and sadly continues to exist: the mockery that Bitcoin maximalism has become in this simple quote: \u201cBitcoin has tarnished the idea of ossification. The ossified Bitcoin is seen by the Ethereum community as a useless protocol upheld in a religious fervor by an intellectual cesspit, unable to follow any line of reason that does not either glorify the perfection of Bitcoin or admonish all other designs.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd I hope everyone\u2019s having a blast at ETH Denver!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hello friends (new and old).

Tax concerns will vary wildly from implementation to implementation, as well anonymity, depending on size of the project and your own opSec practices. </p>\n\n<p>FWIW re: the last point, anon users like banteg and 0xngmi have seemingly done very very well at protecting their identities while simultaneously being highly active in visible DAOs, but I&#39;m sure you can find some users who have drawn more attention to themselves as well, so ymmv.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If they enjoyed it more than they expected... regretted it... found it to make them look more favorably towards (or soured their opinion of) decentralized governance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve never been a delegate on any top 100 DAO but I think most who have been or have otherwise tried to be serious participant can tell you decentralized governance always sucks, and imo there&#39;s really not many ways to make it good, you can only make it less shitty.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still very necessary in many instances and I&#39;m not trying to discourage you from participating--esp since it can also be financially beneficial--but suffice to say if you&#39;ve not already been involved with the sausage making process in a serious way before I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to walk way being happier about it after digging in deeper. When you get down to the brass tacks, 85% of time spent in decentralized governance is people yelling at each other on forums and chats (mainly Discord).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-27 13:14:12","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-02-27 13:30:51","id":"ja9lf44","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11d4bra","parent_id":"t1_ja97bo0","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"I really appreciate the honest thoughts.

it will be best to focus on constraining institutional flows and gating large amounts that move into trusted partitions.  \n\nFinally, I'd like to address recent market events and regulatory developments. \u00a0None of the bad things that happened last year were caused by Ethereum. \u00a0The network has limitations, but these typically result from conscious trade-offs, with emphasis placed on decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. \u00a0As researchers identify solutions, and project teams open-source their software, the Ethereum community contributes to public infrastructure every day. \u00a0Unfortunately, not all actors in the crypto space have good intentions. \u00a0Little needs to be said about those who misbehave, except to note that most serious crypto folks have no love for people whose greed fuels negative perceptions of the industry. \u00a0I'm all for enhanced regulation, especially if it brings clarity and consistency. \u00a0In the interest of full disclosure, I believe the Ethereum ICO would be a security offering if carried out today. \u00a0Nonetheless, the network is clearly decentralized now, with no single entity exercising meaningful control. \u00a0Ethereum isn't perfect, but it's the best the world has to offer.  \n\nTo reiterate my main point, the envisioned public-private partnership doesn't require starting from scratch. \u00a0Much as the internet of knowledge has organically grown to serve the world's communication needs, an internet of value is growing to serve economic needs. \u00a0As a coordination mechanism to enable direct economic participation and a unified programmable ledger, Ethereum stands alone;
