It's an LSD protocol in which anyone can be a node operator and run a vault. When people deposit ETH into that vault, they get a staked ETH token specifically for that vault, and for each set of 32 ETH deposited the NO's StakeWise software will automatically spin up a new validator. This sounds like it would lead to insanely fragmented liquidity, but vault token holders can lock up those vault tokens as collateral to mint osETH: no matter which vault you're coming from, you get completely fungible osETH, which averages out the growth rate accross vaults. NO's can set their own commission rate and aren't forced to deposit collateral or connect to MEV-Boost relays, but those, along with other factors, are combined to produce an overall \"score\" to help guide depositors to the best vaults. They have a private testnet launching this week and a public testnet as soon as they're content with the stability of the private one.\n  - Dappnode generally showed off their nice UI for setting up a staking node, and also showed off their StakeWise integration to easily run a vault.\n* [Travis Cannell, Head of Product at Orchid Labs](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/4bf8cfee-3bca-4fa7-baa5-29c123b9c134/616e2e3c-2337-488a-a656-86330aabe654), talked about their system for \"nanopayments\". From what I was able to figure out, Orchid is primarily an onion routing network with nodes incentivized by crypto payments. So they want the routing node operators to be able to charge users for bandwidth consumed, which they want to formulate as a pay-as-you-go stream of very small payments. Their solution to preventing a flood of transactions that cost way more in fees than the transaction is actually worth is to use probabilistic payments. Instead of charging $0.01 for some data, instead have a 1% of sending $1.00. So you cut down the number of transactions by a factor of 100, but by the law of large numbers, with enough use you converge on the correct total charge on average.\n* [Patrick Collins, CEO of uh \"Chain Accel / Cyfrin / Alpha Chain\"](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/8a728406-73ad-4830-8265-4eeb19a2eea6/df15229e-c6dc-488d-9292-48419c5aa05e) ([video, kinda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbc74oU94FM)) gave a different kind of talk than most, focusing on the differences between Solidity and Vyper in terms of their compilation strategies and optimizations. Maybe it's just nice to see a talk that's just a collection of technical fun facts rather than trying to shill me on their product.

Their solution to preventing a flood of transactions that cost way more in fees than the transaction is actually worth is to use probabilistic payments. Instead of charging $0.01 for some data, instead have a 1% of sending $1.00. So you cut down the number of transactions by a factor of 100, but by the law of large numbers, with enough use you converge on the correct total charge on average.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/8a728406-73ad-4830-8265-4eeb19a2eea6/df15229e-c6dc-488d-9292-48419c5aa05e\">Patrick Collins, CEO of uh &quot;Chain Accel / Cyfrin / Alpha Chain&quot;</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbc74oU94FM\">video, kinda</a>) gave a different kind of talk than most, focusing on the differences between Solidity and Vyper in terms of their compilation strategies and optimizations. Maybe it&#39;s just nice to see a talk that&#39;s just a collection of technical fun facts rather than trying to shill me on their product. I&#39;ll admit I didn&#39;t realize people still used Vyper, but I&#39;m not a smart contract dev and <a href=\"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper\">their github is still active</a> at least. An interesting look into compiled EVM bytecode/opcode.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And I guess that&#39;s it.
