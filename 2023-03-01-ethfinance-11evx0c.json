Now that's finally out, bit of a weight off my shoulders. Still want to get this post out though, so let's do some half-asleep 3 AM Etheerium writing. Pretty normal buidlweek day, with a wide range of broader ecosystem topics, feeling fairly routine now but not at all dull. Twitch still ded, no videos for you.\n\n* [Andrew Beal, Head of Ecosystem at the Forta Foundation](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/271b065c-33f3-40f5-972e-3d187fd38109/1069c953-5dab-43cf-9e6e-c19e037513ef), talked about their efforts to detect on-chain attacks and stop them prior to funds being stolen. They monitor tornado cash withdrawals and have bots to scan all new contract deployments so that they can maybe tell when someone's preparing a funded attack contract. Protocols with \"pause buttons\" are generally a little too slow to react to these imminent attacks. Protocols may want to implement a hot/cold wallet split or use strong protocol-level withdrawal limits. Getting white hats to frontrun an attacker is becoming less viable with the prevalence of private order flow. There was a mention that if the community were willing to accept some censorship, MEV-Boost builders and relays could potentially censor an attacker while countermeasures are prepared (a dilemma I hope not to have to face as a relay operator). Also automated circuit breakers and insurance, but those aren't perfect either.\n* [Someone from Apian who I don't think was on the speaker list](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/13ca5079-09d8-4261-b7be-b3c6f2b3e075/ba2b0079-0afc-4ae3-8185-844fb3dde5c8) presented their strategy for \"first class\" multiplayer gaming on blockchain. Their goal is to get the kind of low-latency real-time games executed P2P and confirmed by consensus algorithm on-chain rather than running on a centralized server, which is certainly ambitious. They demoed a tron lightcycle-style game that was apparently running P2P on some local laptops, other machines around the country, and one in the middle of nowhere on a Starlink connection. They don't have much of a website but [it's something if you're curious](http://apian-framework.com/).\n* [Dave Rodman, Managing Partner at The Rodman Law Group](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/6a0880d3-c716-4e43-8e3d-28e7af217b2e/f848be6e-fb03-4103-9473-5a641744dd72) was interviewed on stage about how to navigate web3 safely. To put it simply, he was not afraid to scare the audience. He's taking Gensler's recent threat (\"if you have a token and a team working on a project, I'm gonna get you\") very seriously. Very clearly said you **should not** issue a token or a token warrant (I think that's what I heard?) from a US company. Quickly outlined a setup of three separate Caymanian companies that give you the most protection from the SEC at the moment. Used a lot of big lawyery words that went right over my head. Don't issue tokens in the US.\n* [Nate, who appears to be various things at various places](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/06a2a91e-09db-4e56-9264-913c11bca9ac/162a39cc-a616-4450-8a1a-b7c70d622cc6) explored demand-side tokenomics. Explained that the demand side is much more important than the supply side, and that the three aspects of DST that you need to be successful are utility, value capture, and economic security. Likes the original Maker design for these three aspects. But when you look at some projects that have problems with their tokenomics it becomes clear that they're missing one of these. Terra/Luna collapsed because it had no economic security. Uniswap is in an awkward spot because it's failing at value capture. He mentioned some token nobody had heard of, and explained that the reason nobody had heard of it was because it has no utility so just immediately falls apart.\n* [Joshua Tobkin, Co-founder & CEO at Supra](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/fbef3055-8d79-4dbb-ad6c-6e30ad86bcb0/7ef45579-db13-44cc-8679-39fcafd33491) gave kind of a bland talk about oracles, barely covering the basics, but when he finished his talk with 10 minutes left, he found his stride in the Q&A and it actually got interesting. Supra's oracles actually run on their own chain in order to perform a consensus algorithm and avoid byzantine behavior amongst untrusted data sources. But they're not running another boring L1. They're actually close with EigenLayer and plan to secure their chain with PoS restaking from Ethereum validators! I bet we're going to start hearing that a lot more in the near future.\n\nLast year I went to multiple days of DeSci talks. Found it interesting, but I'm not actively a researcher and not quite interested enough to try to get a DeSci job, so I haven't tracked the space. But the DeSci folks are back at ETHDenver and they've been busy! Last year the main impression I got was that it was a lot of ideas, little actual direction, and zero adoption. So far the impression I have this year is a lot of (very slightly more refined) ideas, a slightly focused direction, and the barest minimum of adoption. Most of the DeSci stuff will be part of the DAODenver side-event that I didn't sign up for, but this was in the BUIDLhub so I could get a taste. Quite fitting that I was working on my paper review at the time. Fun to see what they've got, going to [link their schedule for this particular event just once here](https://better-waste-5eb.notion.site/Utilizing-Building-and-Evaluating-Digital-Tools-for-Decentralized-Science-30d74e5743994396baa1ea639ddc24e8).\n\n* Why DeSci: Shady El Damaty interviewed Lindsay Cameron, a postdoc in neuroscience who is new to the idea of DeSci to get her thoughts. Sounds like she's experienced plenty of the dark side of academia. Her PI stole all the credit for a patent she wrote, and she couldn't really do anything about it because he basically controlled her entire future academic career. She wanted to research psychedelics but found a lot of resistance and stigma around it. Her small lab struggles for funding and access to data that the larger labs have much less trouble with. Didn't get too much into her thoughts on DeSci but she found the idea generally appealing, and I wouldn't blame her if she wanted to just tear the whole traditional system down.\n* To De or not to De Science: A panel discussion intended to pit some DeSci skeptics against the believers in a healthy debate, but the panelists all agreed too much. Most interesting was the nuanced take on web3 tooling. Last year it was a little \"beat the academic research system over the head with tokens and NFTs until science is solved\", but now there's a little more skepticism about needing a blockchain and tokens for everything. Still plenty of interest in trying to find ways in which web3 can help align incentives for funding, but more nuanced I guess.\n* Onboarding Scientists: Dimitri De Jonghe and Alfred Kim took a hard stance that DeSci needs to focus on actually filling some unmet need that scientists have. Like some of these proposed paper publishing platforms and open data access systems are cool, but scientists' main need to is to, you know, keep their jobs. And these days, in order to keep their jobs, scientists have to write a lot of grants so that their employer gets a nice large cut and the scientist is worth keeping around. They can't just give that all up. Suggestion that the path forward is to find people with good ideas but who can't find funding through the traditional system. Maybe DeSci starts with a bunch of web3 people who kind of want to pivot into science, which leads to bringing in young (but more traditional) scientists, which eventually builds up to a thriving parallel system for research.\n* Macro Tooling Short Talks: Weavechain does confidential computing in which researchers can run code on private data without ever seeing that data. DeSci Nodes is a publishing platform which closely ties all artefacts to the paper and makes it easy to link to and directly run code. Verse is a platform for online identity, linking to ORCiD and working with holonym to provide ZK attestations about credentials. DBDAO turns a database into a DAO, where every row is an NFT representing one member's (possibly encrypted) data that they get paid for when researchers access it. Bacalhau is a system to move the compute code to data rather than moving the data to the code, so the data stays in the possession of its original owner and it's easy to follow GDPR.\n\ncya","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver Day 5</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11dyi3r/daily_general_discussion_february_28_2023/jaboex1/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Have a paper review deadline later today (the 1st) and just can&#39;t let myself half-ass it at all, so stayed up late to get it down to a level of polish that I&#39;m comfortable with. Now that&#39;s finally out, bit of a weight off my shoulders. Still want to get this post out though, so let&#39;s do some half-asleep 3 AM Etheerium writing. Pretty normal buidlweek day, with a wide range of broader ecosystem topics, feeling fairly routine now but not at all dull. Twitch still ded, no videos for you.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/271b065c-33f3-40f5-972e-3d187fd38109/1069c953-5dab-43cf-9e6e-c19e037513ef\">Andrew Beal, Head of Ecosystem at the Forta Foundation</a>, talked about their efforts to detect on-chain attacks and stop them prior to funds being stolen. They monitor tornado cash withdrawals and have bots to scan all new contract deployments so that they can maybe tell when someone&#39;s preparing a funded attack contract. Protocols with &quot;pause buttons&quot; are generally a little too slow to react to these imminent attacks. Protocols may want to implement a hot/cold wallet split or use strong protocol-level withdrawal limits. Getting white hats to frontrun an attacker is becoming less viable with the prevalence of private order flow. There was a mention that if the community were willing to accept some censorship, MEV-Boost builders and relays could potentially censor an attacker while countermeasures are prepared (a dilemma I hope not to have to face as a relay operator). Also automated circuit breakers and insurance, but those aren&#39;t perfect either.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/13ca5079-09d8-4261-b7be-b3c6f2b3e075/ba2b0079-0afc-4ae3-8185-844fb3dde5c8\">Someone from Apian who I don&#39;t think was on the speaker list</a> presented their strategy for &quot;first class&quot; multiplayer gaming on blockchain. Their goal is to get the kind of low-latency real-time games executed P2P and confirmed by consensus algorithm on-chain rather than running on a centralized server, which is certainly ambitious. They demoed a tron lightcycle-style game that was apparently running P2P on some local laptops, other machines around the country, and one in the middle of nowhere on a Starlink connection. They don&#39;t have much of a website but <a href=\"http://apian-framework.com/\">it&#39;s something if you&#39;re curious</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/6a0880d3-c716-4e43-8e3d-28e7af217b2e/f848be6e-fb03-4103-9473-5a641744dd72\">Dave Rodman, Managing Partner at The Rodman Law Group</a> was interviewed on stage about how to navigate web3 safely. To put it simply, he was not afraid to scare the audience. He&#39;s taking Gensler&#39;s recent threat (&quot;if you have a token and a team working on a project, I&#39;m gonna get you&quot;) very seriously. Very clearly said you <strong>should not</strong> issue a token or a token warrant (I think that&#39;s what I heard?) from a US company. Quickly outlined a setup of three separate Caymanian companies that give you the most protection from the SEC at the moment. Used a lot of big lawyery words that went right over my head. Don&#39;t issue tokens in the US.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/06a2a91e-09db-4e56-9264-913c11bca9ac/162a39cc-a616-4450-8a1a-b7c70d622cc6\">Nate, who appears to be various things at various places</a> explored demand-side tokenomics. Explained that the demand side is much more important than the supply side, and that the three aspects of DST that you need to be successful are utility, value capture, and economic security. Likes the original Maker design for these three aspects. But when you look at some projects that have problems with their tokenomics it becomes clear that they&#39;re missing one of these.

This gives me a 5-A - // - 5-A model to start working on the 7-body. I am usually balancing between finding a rhyme and an opposite sound for the 7-body, sometimes a rhyme gives more coherence, sometimes an opposite sound gives better structure.

Allow me to explain.\n\n**Paragons**\n\nParagons is a gaming guild building infrastructure and finding ways to support *multiple* different gaming projects. It was created originally targeting Parallel, and they will be most heavily involved in that specific ecosystem, but I believe they have some other partnering games too, although I haven\u2019t been paying much attention there.\n\nOn the Parallel side a lot of their initial funding went towards strategic asset acquisition of Parallel assets. They also held a public funding round selling their tokens at launch for rarer cards to build a collection to for parasets. (The public and private price tags on tokens were actually the same at a price of 34 cents) As a result they have a massive amount of assets that can be lent to players in the future, or that will generate them revenue based on the success of the game. As mentioned in a previous post, there are a number of ways that Parallel allows you to gain exposure to their success. (See my previous post on Parallel Assets) Paragons has generalized exposure through all possible avenues as a DAO due to the contents of their Parallel holdings. \n\nThis has also led to a massive amount of PRIME holdings that they will likely leverage for a number of reasons, such as hosting tournaments, LPing for revenue, and staking. Stakers of the PDT token will receive dividends in PRIME, and their staking system rewards those that stake for longer. Since they have assets like PRIME keys, masterpieces, and other assets that earn PRIME and ETH based on how successful Parallel is, you could definitely say this is a way to gain exposure to Parallel. It remains to be seen if any alternative sources of revenue they may make in the future (imagining maybe ad revenue from Tournaments, but who knows) will also go to PDT holders, but I would expect to see the community ask for that if it were to come to be the case.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning I personally have exposure to PDT, but not as much direct exposure to Parallel as I have, which I\u2019ll cover below.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Parallel**\n\n\nTo invest in Parallel directly, I would say you can either:\n\n* **(1)** Buy Parallel assets \u2014 again see my previous post for how that gives revenue exposure to different parts of their game.\n\n* **(2)** Buy PRIME \u2014 this price will be driven by the various \u201cPRIME\u201d sinks, which are basically sources of demand on the token. There are **a ton** of these planned; at least 8, but some that are yet to be released. The first two (only live ones now) \u201cArtigraph\u201d and \u201cPayload\u201d have eaten > 5% of the circulating supply so far, prior to game release. You\u2019ll have to DYOR if you want to learn more on these cause there\u2019s just too much to type.\n\n* **(3)** You can actually try to play the game with NFTs in your deck. The higher % of your deck is NFTs, the more you earn; but you\u2019ll be able to try the game out with extremely cheap non-NFT cards if you want. This will hopefully attract non crypto people. I\u2019ve heard nothing but great things about the alpha, and they\u2019ve been building it diligently for 2 years, with an amazing vision, so I\u2019m extremely optimistic it\u2019ll actually be a fun game.\n\n* **(4)** This one is more conducive to 3, or to those that like to watch twitch streamers, is you aim to collect assets or cards based on the meta game that develops. Cards that are widely used will likely do better than those that aren\u2019t. One future PRIME sink will allow holders of cards to spend PRIME to spawn \u201cechoes\u201d or the non-NFT versions of cards that can be sold to other players. This will hopefully maintain collectibility for the NFT versions while allowing the game to scale to more players. But again if you\u2019re watching the meta-game, investing in specific cards and selling echoes could be another way.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s exactly the same, but it is one way to bet on Parallel.

I\u2019ve heard nothing but great things about the alpha, and they\u2019ve been building it diligently for 2 years, with an amazing vision, so I\u2019m extremely optimistic it\u2019ll actually be a fun game.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>(4)</strong> This one is more conducive to 3, or to those that like to watch twitch streamers, is you aim to collect assets or cards based on the meta game that develops. Cards that are widely used will likely do better than those that aren\u2019t. One future PRIME sink will allow holders of cards to spend PRIME to spawn \u201cechoes\u201d or the non-NFT versions of cards that can be sold to other players. This will hopefully maintain collectibility for the NFT versions while allowing the game to scale to more players. But again if you\u2019re watching the meta-game, investing in specific cards and selling echoes could be another way.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-01 19:49:59","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-03-01 20:44:15","id":"jakwnqu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11evx0c","parent_id":"t1_jakmqta","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Naelex","body":"Awesome reply thanks!
