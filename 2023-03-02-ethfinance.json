Like most LSDs, it separates the node operators (who actually run the validators and usually have to put up some collateral) from the stakers who provide most of the ETH. But when 32 ETH is available to make a new validator, the protocol randomly selects a number of NOs to be grouped together in one DVT set, and they all have to work together run this new validator. Since DVT participants are selected for groups randomly, it's less likely that they'll all agree to collude to carry out an attack.

What's interesting is that many of them have a goal to support governmental and enterprise privacy requirements.

Just some high-level overview about why this is important.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/f4e36a61-1ed8-4a60-808f-ee6a0fa06208/db9fd961-caff-4bf1-8d85-e9aed2611227\">Paul Brody from Nightfall, Asta Li from Privy, Matt Solomon from Umbra, Jill Gunter from Espresso, and Elena Nadolinski from Iron Fish</a> took over for another panel, this one on encryption and privacy projects. What&#39;s interesting is that many of them have a goal to support governmental and enterprise privacy requirements. It&#39;s not just about making a permissionless tornado cash, it&#39;s about allowing corporations to execute complex private transactions for their own purposes or to comply with regulations like GDPR, while hopefully remaining attractive for the privacy of end-users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Not the biggest fan of panes from what I&#39;ve seen today.

I will be the first to admit I may not always be right nor the most knowledgeable, but I do my best to be honest with my interactions, open to other (reasonable!) opinions even if I disagree and if I'm wrong admit it. Throughout that time, I've tried to contribute to projects where I can in an effort to be more involved / give back to the space, and I feel becoming a delegate is a logical next step of that. I know that's all a fairly generic platitude, but I do mean it. My goal is to use the delegate process to make decisions that put HOP governance and it's protocol in the best place to succeed, which hopefully in turn helps grow the L2 ecosystem on Ethereum broadly. \n\nIf I became a HOP delegate, this would be my first time doing any type of delegated governance work. So I can understand some hesitation in delegating to a new coming. However, between the general knowledge throughout my history in the space and my involvement in other projects I think I can do a good job at it. Some examples where I've been part of projects to better the Ethereum ecosystem include content creation for [Support1559.org](https://Support1559.org) (no longer functional, so here is the [GitHub referencing that](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/1559-outreach/blob/main/README.md) as part of a bigger EIP1559 signaling project), [ethsunshine.com](https://ethsunshine.com) ([commits](https://github.com/etheralpha/project-sunshine)), and ethmerge.com ([joint commit](https://ethmerge.com/?q=what-is-the-triple-halvening)). I also took a stab an aggregating commitments to 22% staking caps ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/BobRossiETH/ETH-Staking-Service-22Cap-Signaling)), as well as am one of the multisig members of the EVMavericks project. Those have all had varying degrees of success, but they have been steps in my goal of being more than a passive investor. As noted above, I think trying out the delegate space is sort of a new mountain to conquer, hence my hemming and hawing about it broadly. \n\nWhy I want to delegate for HOP specifically? I've always been one who preferred to invest and learn about the underlying infrastructure. ETH has for a long time been my fundamental holding, and still is. I've basically lived and breathed ETH in this space since the BTC / BCH split, and if I dabbled into alts it was almost exclusively ETH tokens. I can acknowledge how important L2 is going to be to scaling Ethereum's throughput in the future, so choosing HOP seems to be like something that aligns with all that. I did get the HOP airdrop, and I had been a liquidity provider in the past. Admittedly, airdrop hunting at first, but I grew familiar with it in general as a user. It seems like a growing project that has potential for being a huge asset to the ecosystem (think how Uniswap is to DEXs). The recent integration with Coinbase had me revisiting the coin, and as I looked around it sort of made sense for something to take a stab at for delegation. \n\nIf I become a delegate, I plan on being active within the HOP governance forums. I also plan on trying to include updates to this community. I think there is a great chance for a symbiotic relationship here. I can become a better delegate through input and learnings from this community, while this community can get updates about the HOP protocol. I don't want to promise I would speaking for the community to the extent of acting strictly on community request (though without a system to check who actually is delegated to me), but it's something that again I think creates a mutual benefit. \n\nFinally, a note on money. There is a delegate incentive running right now. If I meet the threshold, I would be actively participating in that. I try to be honest... it's a reason - by far NOT the only reason - but it's out there and I felt I should address it. I don't want to be perceived as greed or anything, and in fairness to HOP if the goal is to find additional delegates I think in doing this it is a mutual benefit and a natural reaction to a market force. I'm not sure the best way to address all that, but those are my thoughts. \n\nThanks!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey Phiz, I&#39;m down for the challenge!

Some examples where I&#39;ve been part of projects to better the Ethereum ecosystem include content creation for <a href=\"https://Support1559.org\">Support1559.org</a> (no longer functional, so here is the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/1559-outreach/blob/main/README.md\">GitHub referencing that</a> as part of a bigger EIP1559 signaling project), <a href=\"https://ethsunshine.com\">ethsunshine.com</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/etheralpha/project-sunshine\">commits</a>), and ethmerge.com (<a href=\"https://ethmerge.com/?q=what-is-the-triple-halvening\">joint commit</a>). I also took a stab an aggregating commitments to 22% staking caps (<a href=\"https://github.com/BobRossiETH/ETH-Staking-Service-22Cap-Signaling\">GitHub Page</a>), as well as am one of the multisig members of the EVMavericks project. Those have all had varying degrees of success, but they have been steps in my goal of being more than a passive investor. As noted above, I think trying out the delegate space is sort of a new mountain to conquer, hence my hemming and hawing about it broadly. </p>\n\n<p>Why I want to delegate for HOP specifically? I&#39;ve always been one who preferred to invest and learn about the underlying infrastructure. ETH has for a long time been my fundamental holding, and still is. I&#39;ve basically lived and breathed ETH in this space since the BTC / BCH split, and if I dabbled into alts it was almost exclusively ETH tokens. I can acknowledge how important L2 is going to be to scaling Ethereum&#39;s throughput in the future, so choosing HOP seems to be like something that aligns with all that. I did get the HOP airdrop, and I had been a liquidity provider in the past. Admittedly, airdrop hunting at first, but I grew familiar with it in general as a user. It seems like a growing project that has potential for being a huge asset to the ecosystem (think how Uniswap is to DEXs). The recent integration with Coinbase had me revisiting the coin, and as I looked around it sort of made sense for something to take a stab at for delegation. </p>\n\n<p>If I become a delegate, I plan on being active within the HOP governance forums. I also plan on trying to include updates to this community. I think there is a great chance for a symbiotic relationship here. I can become a better delegate through input and learnings from this community, while this community can get updates about the HOP protocol. I don&#39;t want to promise I would speaking for the community to the extent of acting strictly on community request (though without a system to check who actually is delegated to me), but it&#39;s something that again I think creates a mutual benefit. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, a note on money. There is a delegate incentive running right now. If I meet the threshold, I would be actively participating in that. I try to be honest... it&#39;s a reason - by far NOT the only reason - but it&#39;s out there and I felt I should address it. I don&#39;t want to be perceived as greed or anything, and in fairness to HOP if the goal is to find additional delegates I think in doing this it is a mutual benefit and a natural reaction to a market force. I&#39;m not sure the best way to address all that, but those are my thoughts. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-02 09:02:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jan5onz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11fuqpf","parent_id":"t1_jamjela","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/cwhi","body":"Crossposting this here :)  \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11fuqpf/comment/jamvh80/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Crossposting this here :)  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11fuqpf/comment/jamvh80/?utm%5C_source=share&amp;utm%5C_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11fuqpf/comment/jamvh80/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-02 07:59:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jamvy5u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11fuqpf","parent_id":"t1_jamjela","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/wolfparking","body":"I've committed my HOP to Bob-Rossi, not because I'm a hardcore fan of the artist, not because I think a diverse delegation committee will strengthen a project, not because as a long time lurker I've admired Bob-Rossi`s contributions and commitment to Ethfinance and the values that make this community so great, but rather because...
