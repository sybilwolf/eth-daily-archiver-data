I think the idea is that in both of their MEV pipeline products (mev-boost and mev-share), they work because of a combination of commitments and privacy. In the mev-boost relay example, proposers make a *commitment* to a block whose contents are *private* (not known to the proposer). One final slide suggested a possible future in which every part of the MEV pipeline has some commitment+privacy+auction setup.\n* [Kelvin Fichter, Benevolent Chaos Monkey at The Optimism Collective](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/5006bf0b-25c4-4279-84c3-abb05f6b19bc/19494603-1897-462d-bfc3-7eed598507c5), talked about the identity problem. Token voting is just plutocracy which isn't great, and at its core depends on government-mandated private properly laws. Other Sybil resistant protocols aren't bit enough or easy enough to use. Optimism believes that identity should use attestations like \"I met you\" or \"you earned a B.S. in computer science\" at its core. Algorithms can run on top of the resulting attestation network in order to derive properties about people or identify Sybils.\n* [Pablo Villalba, Co-founder of Diva](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/29bc7b94-b7cb-48ff-94d4-f01204bf7915/4fd37c70-fc59-497a-8a8b-0351bd239765) gave another talk on Diva, this one with some good high-level details about their LSD/DVT hybrid. NO's sign up and have a collateral requirement of 1 ETH per validator they run, though of course they'd only be part of a larger set of NO's who use DVT to share the key. They're trying to implement a ZK oracle to read the CL and put that data on the EL instead. They had a little workshop later in the day in which they demonstrated their staking frontend.

He motivated the idea, and listed a surprising amount of applications that would use this. He didn't get into the technology much though, but I always assumed that the technical challenges of undercollateralization are the actual problem, so I'm curious to what extent they've solved that.\n* [Tom McLean, quantitative developer at Vega Protocol](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/5e77c9eb-314c-4b9e-a0ac-099dc4ac1a55/d9223ef1-dc6e-42a8-b22c-2d4e998968d9), covered their system for agent-based modeling of on-chain markets. Protocols are complex, simple rules can lead to complicated behavior, and some parameters need to be properly tuned by governance. The hope is that good agent-based reinforcement learning systems can accurately model what actually happens in markets.\n* I went to a side event put on by Blockswap called [Multichain ERC20](https://multichainerc20.com/) but really only for a few talks as part of their [PoN relay](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mev-and-proof-of-neutrality-at-ethdenver-tickets-507809039507?aff=escb&utm-source=cp&utm-term=listing&utm-campaign=social&utm-medium=discovery&utm-content=attendeeshare) track. They describe a variant of the MEV-Boost system that reduces the trust that needs to be placed on relays, but with some significant tradeoffs. I need to think about it though, there are some odd incentives at play.\n* Also at Blockswap's event was a panel on multi-chain MEV. Interesting concepts. One is that cross-chain and multi-block MEV is complicated and projects may need to do data harvesting to get a competitive edge. Also bloXroute is seeing more and more vertically-integrated searchers and builders and wonders if that's going to be the long-term result.\n* Went to the PizzaDAO Public Goods Pizza Party, but gave up after sitting in the line in the cold outside for a long time. I don't think I would have liked being inside the venue much anyway, probably going to be hot, crowded, and be full of weed smoke.\n* The EVMavericks happy hour, on the other hand, was a great time.

So I&#39;ll say this:</p>\n\n<p>Too many people try to play investment games and over-research trying to find the perfect market timing with what should primarily be thought of as your place of residence. Same with cars. Same with any large purchase really. Instead, just figure out what you can afford, determine what you want out of a house at that price range, and make the (EDUCATED &amp; PATIENT) choices based on that. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, watch for externalities and do your due diligence and yadda yadda Erik Estrada... but like damn, the housing situation is a train wreck... but I&#39;d also rather be on the train when it crashes then be one of the people running along the tracks trying to find the perfect time to jump on. </p>\n\n<p>A little specific to you, but I&#39;d triple emphasize the above if you are basing your house purchase on crypto prices. &quot;Figure out what you can afford&quot; <strong><em>without</em></strong> <strong><em>crypto</em></strong> <strong>(or sell what you need and go from there).</strong> You are taking an already life-changing, massively stressful decision and compounding that problem by adding in the swings in the cryptomarket to the affordability mix. </p>\n\n<p>Real talk? You frankly done goofed if you are trying to negotiate with a seller on the price of a house with your current cash situation being tied (at least partially) to the price of ETH.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-04 22:04:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jazd41g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11hraxm","parent_id":"t1_jaxdps5","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"I appreciate your thoughts - I basically agree entirely.
