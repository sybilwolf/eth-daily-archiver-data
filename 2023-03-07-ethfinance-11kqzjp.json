Went to more than last year, which still isn't saying much. I like sticking close to the main venue to be able to watch a good series of talks if I want. Some side-events were overbooked and crowded to the point of not being able to hold a conversation. But usually good quality talks and venues, very good at getting a lot of people with similar projects and ideology in one space.\n* I gave up on trying to link the Twitch video timestamps at some point, not because I was lazy but because the videos simply weren't posted afterwards. If they fixed that in time for the main event, it was too late because I had already given up. Really they should hire one intern to clip the streams and upload each talk individually, that would be nice.\n* Really didn't get enough sleep. Had to juggle other obligations (some specific to this year that I just have to deal with), and writing this post each night could take 2-3 hours. It's not like I was wasting a lot of time, the day were just packed full!\n* Shout out to all the people I met, reconnected with, and/or hung out with.

Which sort of left me scratching my head. </p>\n\n<p>I got the vibe this went well for Grayscale.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-07 08:13:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jba719t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11kqzjp","parent_id":"t3_11kqzjp","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/earthquakequestion","body":"Can anybody chime in on what the turnaround time might be for a spot etf if grayscale wins this case?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Can anybody chime in on what the turnaround time might be for a spot etf if grayscale wins this case?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-07 09:06:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jbaf5k3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11kqzjp","parent_id":"t1_jba719t","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/charitablechair","body":"years not months","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>years not months</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-08 07:42:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jbewq3j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11kqzjp","parent_id":"t1_jbaf5k3","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/earthquakequestion","body":"Damn, you're going through yesterdays daily?

Automaton wrote a great guide to [creating a personal threat model](https://caches.xyz/the-rostrum/creating-an-online-threat-model-best-practices-for-personal-opsec/) which I thought was well written, eye opening and informative. Thank you Automaton, whoever you are!\n\nOhhh! Ohhh! If you also didn't hear, I added a cool new feature called \"Collaborative Docs\" to both your personal profile AND groups. Think of them like a Word document that multiple people can contribute to! And booyyy howdy is it packed with features!

Now you and your friends, or your groups can collaborate on documents and share them! Check it out on [my profile page at caches](https://caches.xyz/members/d75c89ff27c9ba5a/collab-docs/) to see a doc in action.

I'll tell you why ser! I have backups ser! Yes ser! Backups for days and days ser! But seriously. Look at me. \ud83d\udc40 It's me, JBM. The super paranoid guy. I take a snapshot of the entire server every hour. It's encrypted, then backed up to a RAID array in the same data center as the server. Then, every day a full backup of the website, database, etc... is encrypted, compressed and uploaded to a remote cloud storage provider. Every day. I also burn a copy to a DVD every week and bury it in my garden under my Aconitum flowers.\n\nSo like... I gotchu fam! No worries! Also, since collaborative docs follow standard RTF/HTML formats, you can copy/paste them into your favorite word processor and save a copy on your own computer too! Man ... standards are great ...

I just wanted to say that groups on Caches now have notifications! By default any groups you're a member of will have notifications enabled, but you can 1-click-or-tap-to-unsubscribe-crap group notifications from each groups page. Look for the Bell \ud83d\udd14 icon at the bottom right of the groups cover photo to unsubscribe.\n\nFor group owners, that means posts to your group will show up in your members notification inbox, and if they have an email on file and email notifications enabled, it will send them an email too. That makes this a powerful marketing tool to reach your audiences when you set your groups permissions to only allow owners/moderators to post. For group members, that means you can keep up with your favorite groups and be notified about updates immediately.\n\nMembers can also use the [whats up on caches?](https://caches.xyz/whats-up-on-caches/) page to see all the updates across the whole site that apply to them. This page is different for everyone depending on their activity on the site! It's custom tailored just for you! You can even sort them with a click so you only see updates from your friends, or your groups, or people you're following, or ... well I think you catch my drift.\n\nAnyway there's like way too much to post here without ruthlessly beating you to death with words so I'm just going to leave it at that, but like ... you should come sign up and check it out. I mean it's free, [it's easy](https://caches.xyz/docs/how-tos/how-to-login-to-caches-with-metamask/), and it's totally anonymous... even to me. No email required.

On top protocols we think are decentralized aren't, because there are still \"hidden\" multisigs/ upgradable smart contracts in these protocols, see MKR/Oasis. (\"Hidden\" because they are not easy to spot for devs that don't spend a lot of time and because they are hidden for people that can't read code)\n\nAlso we shouldn't compare \"old\" verticals within the ecosystem with \"new\" developments. L2s are currently in a phase with heavily centralized influence. Most of the time critical infrastructure is not decentralized, since e.g. the sequencer is run by the developing central entity. I understand the argument that everything is regulated because the protocols \n\n>can already be properly assessed in current jurisdictional laws.\n\nbut I don't think this is the reality. The reality is that you can't assess what's right and wrong. \n\nI don't believe that the ecosystem would be as far developed as it is today if everything indeed was regulated. I don't think that defi would be where it is now if it was *really* regulated. Hell, even centralized exchanges aren't *really* regulated, because there is no guidance (in the US) and a CEX like Kraken that is around since 10 years was told to shut down parts of its business, regulated entities like Paxos were told to shut down their business, because there are different regulatory bodies that are competing. \n\nIf everything really was regulated and everyone played by the book innovation would at least slow down. Things like defi and L2s only exist because people took risks and just did stuff without focussing on regulatory stuff. So basically my point is that saying \"we always said centralized entities should be regulated\" but also rooting for innovation to scale Ethereum via L2s (which is just one example, there are NFTs, there could be social networks soon etc. etc.) as fast as possible cause the ecosystem needs to scale is a contradiction. Because again: if these were regulated and L2s were doing everything to meet the expectation of regulators we were probably years away compared to the state of Ethereum that we know today. L2s couldn't launch because sequences aren't decentralized, because smart contracts are still upgradable, etc. In that case you couldn't do an open alpha like starknet does and just say \"hey buddy, thanks for trying this out, but remember you can lose all your funds\". \n\nOn top I think that \"starting decentralized\" probably is an innovation and pace killer as well. Just because of path dependency/ history we as a species have no idea how to start something in a decentralized way. There are probably exceptions, but the majority would fail if everything was decentralized from the beginning. This goes for organization, but also criticial topics like funding.   \n\n\n>Therefore it's imo obvious that decentralization maximalism is the way to go and has to be implemented at the very beginning.\n\nThis again is valid point, but again it's not the reality/ my experience.
