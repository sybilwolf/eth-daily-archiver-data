Everything I tried from Foundry to Tenderly just went into symbol not found mode and started spitting out evm op codes at me the moment I called a function at an address on the blockchain. So if I went and called Curve and got some arithmetic underflow error it was hard to puzzle out what was going on with how I called their contract which caused that. Same thing with custom errors, the ABI is missing so all you see is that it reverted and threw a custom error. I was able to use events and console.log for basically println debugging and reading a stack trace when it was in my code but the line at which I call another contract I'm just at a loss for a good way to debug it.\n\nSeveral examples of eventual root causes:\n\n1) I was calling an implementation address rather than a proxy. I'm still puzzled why this broke things but it did. Probably something to do with delegate calls and the storage actually existing on the proxy.\n\n2) Missing token or mintFrom/withdrawFrom approval. Arithmetic overflow/underflow.\n\n3) Wrong token address used as a parameter.
