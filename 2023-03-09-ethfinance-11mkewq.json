A blockchain is a distributed ledger that maintains a system of\npayments and receipts for cryptocurrency transactions. ETH has grown to become one of the\nlargest cryptocurrencies in the world with a market capitalization of over $170 billion\n\n\n> ETH\u2019s development and management is largely driven by a small number of\ndevelopers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the\nrelated appreciation of ETH. Metz Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 43-47. In 2014, some of those developers founded the\nEthereum Foundation. Metz Aff. \u00b6 39; Ex. 40. The Ethereum Foundation describes itself as a\nnon-profit that is \u201csupports the Ethereum Ecosystem\u201d through its work to \u201cfund protocol\ndevelopment, grow the ecosystem, and advocate for Ethereum\n\n\n> Shortly after the formation of the Ethereum Foundation, an initial coin offering\n(\u201cICO\u201d) was held in which ETH was sold to fund the creation of Ethereum.. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\nThe ETH ICO raised funds to support the development of the Ethereum blockchain, directly\nprovided developers with funding.. \u00b6 35; Ex. 21. The ICO was governed by\ndocuments including the ETH Genesis Sale Terms and Conditions and the Proposed Use of\nRevenue, collectively the \u201cICO Documents\u201d, which described the sale as a means of promoting\nthe development of the Ethereum blockchain by paying expenses incurred by developers, paying\nfor legal contingencies, research, and further development.. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34; Ex. 20. The\nEthereum Foundation and Buterin received a portion of the funding raised in ETH\u2019s ICO.\n. \u00b6 35. Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation also received significant quantities of ETH in\nthe ICO and are believed to retain significant stakes of that ETH today.. \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, 41;\nExs. 21-23, 25.\n\n\n\n> Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation retain significant influence over Ethereum\nand are often a driving force behind major initiatives on the Ethereum blockchain that impact the\nfunctionality and price of ETH. See. \u00b6 43; Ex. 27. Most relevant here, Buterin and the\nEthereum Foundation played key roles in facilitating the recent fundamental shift of the\ntransaction verification method from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.. \u00b6\u00b6 43-47; Exs.\n24, 27-30. Indeed, one developer who worked on creating the software necessary for the\ntransition stated that his team was \u201cgranted permission by the Ethereum Foundation\u201d to work on\nthe shift to proof-of-stake.. \u00b6 47; Ex. 30.\n42. Transactions can only be entered on the blockchain once they are verified or\nvalidated. Under proof-of-work, computers on the Ethereum network competed to answer a\nmathematical puzzle in order to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive in-kind digital\nasset rewards. Under proof-of-stake, however, validators, pledge or \u201cstake\u201d their holdings in\nETH and are randomly chosen to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive an in-kind\ndigital asset reward. By shifting to proof-of-stake, ETH no longer relies upon competition\nbetween computers, but instead now relies on a pooling method that incentivizes users to own\nand stake ETH. The shift to proof-of-stake significantly impacted the core functionality and\nincentives for owning ETH, because ETH holders now can profit merely by participating in\nstaking.. \u00b6 42; Ex. 26.\nc. ETH is Promoted as an Investment\n43. The developers of ETH promoted it as an investment that was contingent on the\ngrowth of the Ethereum network. For instance, the Ethereum Foundation notes on its website that\nmany ETH users \u201csee it as an investment, similar to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201d In addition, the ICO Documents included representations that ETH production would\ndramatically slow over time, resulting in ETH becoming increasingly scarce, and thus more\nvaluable.  \u00b6 34. Indeed, the Ethereum Foundation claims on its website that users of\nEthereum \u201csee it as a digital store of value because the creation of new ETH slows down over\ntime.\u201d. \u00b6 31.

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that maintains a system of\npayments and receipts for cryptocurrency transactions. ETH has grown to become one of the\nlargest cryptocurrencies in the world with a market capitalization of over $170 billion</p>\n\n<p>ETH\u2019s development and management is largely driven by a small number of\ndevelopers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the\nrelated appreciation of ETH. Metz Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 43-47. In 2014, some of those developers founded the\nEthereum Foundation. Metz Aff. \u00b6 39; Ex. 40. The Ethereum Foundation describes itself as a\nnon-profit that is \u201csupports the Ethereum Ecosystem\u201d through its work to \u201cfund protocol\ndevelopment, grow the ecosystem, and advocate for Ethereum</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after the formation of the Ethereum Foundation, an initial coin offering\n(\u201cICO\u201d) was held in which ETH was sold to fund the creation of Ethereum.. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\nThe ETH ICO raised funds to support the development of the Ethereum blockchain, directly\nprovided developers with funding.. \u00b6 35; Ex. 21. The ICO was governed by\ndocuments including the ETH Genesis Sale Terms and Conditions and the Proposed Use of\nRevenue, collectively the \u201cICO Documents\u201d, which described the sale as a means of promoting\nthe development of the Ethereum blockchain by paying expenses incurred by developers, paying\nfor legal contingencies, research, and further development.. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34; Ex. 20. The\nEthereum Foundation and Buterin received a portion of the funding raised in ETH\u2019s ICO.\n. \u00b6 35. Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation also received significant quantities of ETH in\nthe ICO and are believed to retain significant stakes of that ETH today.. \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, 41;\nExs. 21-23, 25.</p>\n\n<p>Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation retain significant influence over Ethereum\nand are often a driving force behind major initiatives on the Ethereum blockchain that impact the\nfunctionality and price of ETH. See. \u00b6 43; Ex. 27. Most relevant here, Buterin and the\nEthereum Foundation played key roles in facilitating the recent fundamental shift of the\ntransaction verification method from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.. \u00b6\u00b6 43-47; Exs.\n24, 27-30. Indeed, one developer who worked on creating the software necessary for the\ntransition stated that his team was \u201cgranted permission by the Ethereum Foundation\u201d to work on\nthe shift to proof-of-stake.. \u00b6 47; Ex. 30.\n42. Transactions can only be entered on the blockchain once they are verified or\nvalidated. Under proof-of-work, computers on the Ethereum network competed to answer a\nmathematical puzzle in order to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive in-kind digital\nasset rewards. Under proof-of-stake, however, validators, pledge or \u201cstake\u201d their holdings in\nETH and are randomly chosen to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive an in-kind\ndigital asset reward. By shifting to proof-of-stake, ETH no longer relies upon competition\nbetween computers, but instead now relies on a pooling method that incentivizes users to own\nand stake ETH. The shift to proof-of-stake significantly impacted the core functionality and\nincentives for owning ETH, because ETH holders now can profit merely by participating in\nstaking.. \u00b6 42; Ex. 26.\nc. ETH is Promoted as an Investment\n43. The developers of ETH promoted it as an investment that was contingent on the\ngrowth of the Ethereum network. For instance, the Ethereum Foundation notes on its website that\nmany ETH users \u201csee it as an investment, similar to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201d In addition, the ICO Documents included representations that ETH production would\ndramatically slow over time, resulting in ETH becoming increasingly scarce, and thus more\nvaluable.  \u00b6 34. Indeed, the Ethereum Foundation claims on its website that users of\nEthereum \u201csee it as a digital store of value because the creation of new ETH slows down over\ntime.\u201d. \u00b6 31.
