I'm not exactly at peak mental performance here atm (again Covid) so bear with me.\n\nDID (Decentralized ID) systems are a hot topic right now. They are needed for everything from free to play games, social media networks, and airdrops to governance systems like OPs Citizens House.

I think this is one of the *existential* risks of Defi and I've written about that [before](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame/) (that sure aged well). I'm personally in favor of the [Gitcoin Passports](https://go.gitcoin.co/passport) framework that enables each user to define their own calculation for Sybil Resistance by identifying their stamps and then having an attestation system like I proposed [awhile ago](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harnessing-collector-psychology-for-good/) compress long form off-chain calculations into simple on-chain maps. However, the focus of these systems ends at being a proof of humanity per address. They are specifically attempting to solve Sybil-resistance.\n\nIn my opinion there can and should be a layer on top of this base calculation for reputation of individuals. For the sake of this discussion I'll limit reputation to being a history of honesty rather than history of competence, impact, or ideology. In that context reputation is synonymous with trust. What can we quantify about something (e.g. code, people, institutions, etc) that makes people trust it? Here are what I think are the three primary pillars of trust:\n\n**Social Attestation**. When someone signs off on a code review, they are making an attestation. Systems like BrightId and Proof of Humanity are entirely social attestations. These systems are inherently subjective and usually *gameable* so are unreliable on their own but much of the world is entirely built upon attestation layers (your government ID for example).\n\n**Time**. The longer something has been there the more time attackers have had to inspect it, identify a vulnerability, and attack it. The longer a person has been around the more opportunities have arisen that might lure them to dishonesty. Inversely, the longer an opportunity (exploiting a smart contract) is present the lower the chance that the market has not acted upon it if that opportunity is real. Time builds confidence that that there is no opportunity and any you think you see are illusory.\n\n**Opportunity Cost of Honesty**. Watch carefully how trust is used once granted. Any position of trust is exploitable to some degree. Otherwise what are you trusting? Honesty is the degree to which an actor is *suboptimal at exploiting that trust*. It might sound strange to quantify honesty as failure to exploit but that's as close as I've come to a formal definition.\n\nThese are subset of what Vitalik has [written about](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) as sources of legitimate outcomes. These make up the trustworthiness of an actor or system rather than outcome. A few disclaimers though. First, nothing is ever fully proven to be trustworthy. This is may sound like a very cynical statement but I've seen code exploit discoveries like [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) on even the most trusted systems. Second, trust is not monotonically increasing. As systems or the world with which they integrate change trust in them fluctuates.\n\nOnto calculating a reputation score from these. With PoS Sybil-resistance is derived from the money you have. But your reputation is derived from the money you don't (in a sense). It's the money you don't have because you chose to be honest. This is akin to the forgery-resistance score from Gitcoin passport being based on the amount you have spent/lost. So quantify that number and turn it into a capital denominated reputation number and then modify it by your forgery resistance score.\n\nNow how do we integrate this into tokenomic systems? Returning to the basics of consensus we want to get people together to make decisions. Today we use capital for Sybil-resistance. The great insight of Bitcoin was that the cost and failure rate of attacking a network scales super-linearly with the number of anonymous actors in that network. Past a certain threshold it is safe and profitable to be honest and risky and expensive to be dishonest. If we have Sybil-resistance from DID systems could we just let people decide the outcome without capital? Sounds like democracy, right? The main issue with that is the \"nothing at stake\" problem. People have to have something to lose for many game-theory scenarios to make sense. But if you add a reputation system like I've loosely described above then people can stake (and lose) their reputation. In so far as this has monetary value (in income loss) this may be a viable source of security that does not rely directly on capital. It certainly has the properties required to exclude bad actors from the system on first offense.\n\nThis actually creates a beautiful sort of flywheel. By acting honestly you build a reputation score. You can stake your reputation in order to promise certain services. By fulfilling your promise you generate both an income stream and further reputation. This creates a quadratic benefit to continue acting honestly. I wouldn't recommend this for the Ethereum base chain but I think this makes a lot of sense for exactly the type of chain-adjacent software that EigenLayer is applicable to. A world in which honest actors can build an income stream predicated on their reputation rather than just their bank account is also a basis for UBI. It's a step closer to the type of world in which I'd like to live.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Been awhile since I&#39;ve had a chance to write.

Please take the time to read this, I know it is long but I believe it is important. No jokes this time. Thanks in advance friends.\n\nAs you may or may not know, I started a website called \u201cCaches.\u201d If you\u2019ve never visited it, I will briefly explain. If you have, then you already know. Caches is a social network/community website focused on Web3 Technology and Ethereum. A place to explore all of the interesting technologies and ideas that are spinning off of this new paradigm that we all love. It\u2019s completely anonymous, and membership is free and only available via Ethereum wallet login.\n\nI intended for Caches to be somewhere for our community to teach, and share our knowledge outside of the walls of third parties like Reddit or Discord. Something we own, so our voices can be properly heard, and so they can\u2019t be muted due to some draconian corporate attack on crypto or something. A place where you could \u201ccache\u201d your content and share it with the world anonymously, using identity technology being pioneered by Ethereum. Our mark on the world outside our biosphere. I also hoped we could show the world how you build a community, powered by web3 technology, out here on the old www... A home.\n\nNow I have a lot of ideas, but that\u2019s the gist of it. I have spent a lot of time in this pursuit and I have struggled with it. The platform I chose to build Caches on, WordPress, has absolutely no help, plugins, or extensions for crypto/web3. Really no good CMS platform out there does. Since I am a terrible coder, and I am already familiar with developing websites rapidly using Wordpress, I chose to move forward using it to save time, for better or for worse. This has been an adventure to say the least.\n\nRecently, I spoke with another EVM, /u/juxtanotherposition, and we immediately hit it off. Turns out, just by stroke of luck that on March 24th, 2023 he will be giving a presentation at WordCamp Phoenix on *\u201cWordpress, Community and Web3.\u201d* Strange how the world works sometimes \u2026 Caches is built on Wordpress, it has custom developed Web3 authentication and NFT gating, and it was made for a community\u2026 his very own community! This was literally a match made in heaven! So with all that said, we agreed to feature Caches during the presentation as an example of community built on Wordpress with web3 tech!\n\nThat means **we will have eyes from the Wordpress developer community focused on Caches and the EVM!** *AAAAHHHH!* This is why I need your help! Now look, I know I\u2019m funny, and I make you laugh, and maybe you\u2019ve even checked out Caches once or twice to humor me, and then laughed yourself to sleep ... but I need them to see the value in this. Not just for me, or Caches, or the EVMs \u2026 for Ethereum.\n\n**Why is Wordpress important?**  \nWordpress is a free, open source content management system that powers an astounding **43% of all websites** online. I bet you didn\u2019t know Caches ran on Wordpress before I told you, did you? A lot of your favorite sites run on it. It\u2019s free, open source, community developed, and extensible. It also runs on a completely opensource technology stack. Wordpress.org develops the Wordpress software and they are a non-profit entity. Their ethos is very aligned with ours. They want to enable people to have their own platform to share their ideas, and words without having to rely on anyone. You can check out their [about us](https://wordpress.org/about/) page if you aren\u2019t familiar with them.\n\n**Why is this important for the community?**  \nSince Caches was built for the EVM/ETHFi community, we have a very unique opportunity to get our ideas, and our community out to potentially thousands of Wordpress developers who will be viewing Caches during @juxta\u2019s presentation. They will undoubtedly share Caches with other developers. That means we have an opportunity to get web3 ideas and even our community baked into Wordpress! I literally can not think of a bigger opportunity for us, and for Ethereum. If we can get developers to create plugins, extensions, themes and more that enable and integrate web3 technology into Wordpress, we have an opportunity to put this in front of 43% of website owners WORLDWIDE! I can not think of a better group than all of you to guide and usher these people into this new paradigm.\n\nWith our help we can get this technology out to the world, and we can foster the Wordpress community during their exploration of this new technology. Give them a place to safely ask questions and get good answers ranging from JBM to Logris level. A place to share ideas, develop friendships and connections \u2026 just like we all have done through the sub. This is our opportunity to put the community at the forefront of something big outside our walls and build ourselves as an authority in this space.\n\n**What\u2019s in it for me?**  \nJuxta has asked if Caches could be a sort of \u201cdevelopment\u201d test bed for Wordpress web3 plugins and technology. I like this idea, we get free development work to make Caches the premier web3 community and the developers get a real live site to develop their product. This is a win/win/win! I get to see the thing I started grow and flourish at the hands of people much smarter and more capable than me. It\u2019s beautiful man! That\u2019s really it. I hope to use it to make money, however we decide to do that, just like you.\n\n**What\u2019s in it for you?**  \nI honestly built this site for our community. I genuinely built it to enable everyone to be heard out here on the web. As I have repeatedly stated, I don\u2019t want to own this thing by myself. So I hope you can join me, we can come up with new ways to push Ethereum/web3 forward in the web2 and we can come up with creative ways for everyone in the community to earn some money for themselves without turning into a marketing machine. I want everyone to be a part of that journey, and I want everyone to be able to contribute ideas to that goal, and most importantly I want to work with you to figure out how we can own this thing together in the fairest way possible. I don\u2019t have any of that figured out, but that\u2019s ultimately where I want to be\u2026 a community owned and operated by the community.\n\n**How can I help?**  \nPop in the EVM discord. If you're not an EVM, I still want your help. Please. Join the public-channel and DM a mod to have the \"Caches\" role added to your account and then you'll be able to see the #caches channel there even if you don't have an EVM. I will use that to try to collaborate and focus our energies best I can. I need you! We have just 10 days to try and make Caches, the community and Ethereum look good... but hey... this is just the beginning. So don't do it for me. Do it for **ETHEREUM.**\n\nSincerely,  \nJBM \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Dear EVMs, EIPanda\u2019s and the ETHFinance community,</p>\n\n<p>I come before you today to genuinely ask for your help.

Any decent houses are still snapped quickly off the market for above asking and the main thing that we still aren\u2019t building anywhere near enough new houses each year. The best the UK has achieved in recent years is 100k below the government and independent targets, approx 2/3 of what is need in a given year. In ETH terms, imagine if only 2/3 enough ETH were issued each year to satisfy demand - numbers only go up. \n\nAside from supply/demand there are structural reasons why the UK housing market cannot (read: won\u2019t be allowed to) crash. Housing is by far the primary collateral for borrowers and many MPs are landlords, as well as in the middle and upper classes there\u2019s too much lifestyle riding on property values.

But this is only useful for CEXs and DEXs that do large batch transactions. Normal users would not send different tokens in the same transaction.\n\nThe ugly part is that if you search for \"Cardano TPS\", the top result is still a **misleading Forbes article** that says TPS is 250.
