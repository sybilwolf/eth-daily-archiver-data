I can't speak highly on bots themselves, but I have some perspective here from my job.\n\nOne, I haven't taken the BAR, but I've taken an exam that is fairly equivalent of my major. In my experience, the test is still fairly a 'memorize answers' type of thing. So ChatGPT passing the BAR is impressive from a technical standpoint given it's a general-purpose bot, but it's still a rather straight forward achievement. At least, again, assuming the BAR is structured fairly similar to what I've experienced. It feels more like a \"it can play chess, but can it host a chess tournament\" situation. \n\nWhich brings me to this: I'm not sure you can ever replace some of the human elements of a Lawyer / Doctor? Yeah, so the bot can search the thousands of case law for relevant cites, or analyze patient testing to assist with diagnosis. That really hammers the entry level and lower level positions within the profession. However, it doesn't really replace the actual court time or bedside conversations. They need to exist and need to be done by real people, if not for technical reasons, but simple human emotion. \n\nWhy does that matter? I'm seeing these large companies using places like India to outsource the entry-level type positions within these types of business environments. I know my job, and a few friends I've talked to, go on about this. It's not so much replacing workers, as much as being a substitute for what was previously intern / entry level / lesser educated roles (as in, lower education levels, not intelligence). So my wonder is if this is really going to affect those jobs... or more so destroy the offshoring trends. As I'd assume the reality is offshoring these types of tasks is more of a necessary evil to remain cost competitive. One that would be gladly replaced if these bots can do the jobs for not only cheaper, but more securely and easier to control. \n\nMaybe I'm underestimating the speed of this adoption, but that is where it feels now. Cashiers come to mind with this - as much as all these retail places want to push for self-checkouts and app ordering + pickup, it really only has reduced that job to 2 to 3 instead of 10 people.

Yeah, so the bot can search the thousands of case law for relevant cites, or analyze patient testing to assist with diagnosis. That really hammers the entry level and lower level positions within the profession. However, it doesn&#39;t really replace the actual court time or bedside conversations. They need to exist and need to be done by real people, if not for technical reasons, but simple human emotion. </p>\n\n<p>Why does that matter? I&#39;m seeing these large companies using places like India to outsource the entry-level type positions within these types of business environments. I know my job, and a few friends I&#39;ve talked to, go on about this. It&#39;s not so much replacing workers, as much as being a substitute for what was previously intern / entry level / lesser educated roles (as in, lower education levels, not intelligence). So my wonder is if this is really going to affect those jobs... or more so destroy the offshoring trends. As I&#39;d assume the reality is offshoring these types of tasks is more of a necessary evil to remain cost competitive. One that would be gladly replaced if these bots can do the jobs for not only cheaper, but more securely and easier to control. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe I&#39;m underestimating the speed of this adoption, but that is where it feels now. Cashiers come to mind with this - as much as all these retail places want to push for self-checkouts and app ordering + pickup, it really only has reduced that job to 2 to 3 instead of 10 people. Not really eliminating it outright.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-14 11:38:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jc81dlu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11qy7me","parent_id":"t1_jc7vb4r","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hblask","body":"Interesting points, this seems like, if nothing else, the starting point for AI. \n\nMy expertise is (was?) programming, and even the previous version of ChatGPT was pretty good at entry level programming.
