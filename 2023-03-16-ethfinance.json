Only connected and <em>I think</em> it just took whatever already had approvals? Which was all my DAI. feelsbadman.jpg - 5400 DAI is no small sum. It unfortunately looks like they got a few people before the tweet was hidden.</p>\n\n<p>My brain finally went &#39;nope&#39; when it asked to approve RPL, but everything before that was just a signature to connect (I think?), not a transaction or approval. </p>\n\n<p>Things I could have done better (that I usually would do!):<br/>\n- Matched the twitter handle from the tweet to the actual account<br/>\n- Found the link elsewhere (verified it) before connecting my wallet, especially in their discord<br/>\n- Generally slow down and read when signing things from my wallet.     </p>\n\n<p>Expensive lesson learned! I&#39;m going to lay down and watch a movie or something, I&#39;m super bummed that I&#39;m a dummy.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing learned in this (thanks to <a href=\"/u/Ribilla_\">/u/Ribilla_</a> ) - DAI is a special kind of ERC20 that allows transfers that require only a signature (<code>permit</code>, which is a signature-based approval function) - it doesn&#39;t look like your typical approval or transaction. So even signatures when connecting to sites should be treated as potentially dangerous and giving away your assets.    </p>\n\n<p>See here: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/daily_general_discussion_march_16_2023/jch9a3s/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/daily_general_discussion_march_16_2023/jch9a3s/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-16 10:32:14","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-03-16 13:44:14","id":"jcggo1x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11slqjw","parent_id":"t3_11slqjw","score":52,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/2peg2city","body":"Oof, hope your airdrop is enough to make you whole!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Oof, hope your airdrop is enough to make you whole!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-16 11:17:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jcgnvrt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11slqjw","parent_id":"t1_jcggo1x","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nixorokish","body":"i would take a net zero. that would be dope :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>i would take a net zero. that would be dope :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-16 11:21:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jcgoh2z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11slqjw","parent_id":"t1_jcgnvrt","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/gethwethreth","body":"Hmm.
