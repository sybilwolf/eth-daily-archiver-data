This knowledge has yielded practical benefits in that I have learned how to join thousands of others to stake ether on the Ethereum blockchain which now provides me with a steady income.\n\n\r  \nThis knowledge has also allowed me to cut through the hype, misinformation, and disinformation surrounding cryptocurrency in the popular discourse to conclude that in fact, **the crypto ecosystem of digital assets, smart contracts, and public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has value and will disrupt economic and business systems around the world.** For instance:\n\n\r  \n\u2022\tDecentralized financial protocols allow everyday people to instantly make payments around the world and make loans and other financial transactions without commercial middlemen\r  \n\u2022\tImmutable and transparent records on the public blockchain can protect intellectual property and assure fair and transparent management of royalties\r  \n\u2022\tPublic blockchains can serve as a permanent store of critical personal events including birth, death, graduation, etc.\r  \n\u2022\tAssignment of unique non-fungible tokens can help manage ownership and transfer of collectibles, valuables, artwork, etc.\r  \n\u2022\tBlockchain has potential business uses such as on-line gaming, supply chain management or carbon credit system.\r  \n\u2022\tThe crypto ecosystem can transform the internet business model from allowing dominant internet platforms (eg, Facebook, Google, Apple) to own and profit from personal information to a \u201cweb3\u201d model where the user controls their own data on the blockchain.\r  \n\n\nI have also been struck by the fact that **there is significant alignment between the principles underlying cryptocurrency and the progressive agenda.**  The essence of the crypto ecosystem is that data and open-source computer code distributed and synchronized around the world can replace reliance on institutional middlemen (eg, banks, internet platforms) with a decentralized transparent system available to all whose trust comes from the decentralized crypto ecosystem in which users can directly take custody of their own assets and personal data.  These features can directly support the progressive agenda and its commitment to sweeping, transformative change:\r  \n\u2022\tIncome inequality can be reduced by helping underserved populations\u2014who under legacy systems often cannot get a loan, buy a house, or start a business\u2014to build wealth and carry out financial transactions without needed to rely on gatekeeping banks that may have institutional biases that disadvantage them.  \r  \n\u2022\tFacilitating crypto use can help advance racial justice and equity.  A 2019 FDIC survey found that 14% of African American households and 12% of Hispanic American households were unbanked compared to only 2.5% of white households.  A recent Harris Poll found that 30% of Black Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans owned crypto compared to 17% of white Americans.\r  \n\u2022\tReplacing banks with self-custody and a fully transparent accounting on a public blockchain will reimagine the role of institutions that exacerbate injustice and inequality. \r  \n\n\n**Congress must and will create a policy framework for digital assets in the US; it will be important to help shape this policy to promote progressive principles.** Now is the time to act.  Congress will likely see a number of bills introduced this session on such issues as rights to self-custody, defining digital asset taxonomy, and clarifying regulatory oversight.  Discussion on such legislation has already begun in the new Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee which has recently expanded its scope to include cryptocurrency.  This Subcommittee includes two CPC members\u2014representatives Torres of NY and Sherman of CA.  The CPC can utilize its subcommittee membership and other opportunities to actively engage in shaping this legislation to reflect progressive priorities.\r  \n\n\nMoreover, **engaging on this issue provides a great opportunity for bipartisanship.** The need for regulation has bipartisan agreement. A number of Republican members have been actively supportive of addressing policy in this area (eg, representative Emmer of MN, Davidson of OH, and others).  It would be remarkable, yet natural, to join forces with the other party on this issue to demonstrate its importance to the American people.\r  \n\n\nIn addition to legislation, **progressive congressional oversight is needed**. I have been dismayed at the administration\u2019s actions that, in the context of overall banking system failures and under the guise of consumer protection, are inhibiting the development of a regulatory environment that would allow the digital asset sector to prosper.  There are those who believe that the administration is responding to entrenched interests that are threatened by the transformative change that crypto may catalyze, taking advantage of the current banking crises to squash crypto, such as by discouraging banks from holding crypto or servicing crypto clients.\r  \n\n\nI hope you and the CPC will take on this important issue to both support the progressive agenda as well as keep America\u2019s leadership in this new sector.  Blockchain and crypto are borderless by nature.  If the US cannot provide a fertile environment for innovation, the developers will go elsewhere and will not be serving the country or its people.\r  \n\n\nThank you very much.\r  \n================","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>At the encouragement of <a href=\"/u/TheCryptosAndBloods\">u/TheCryptosAndBloods</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/comment/jcfgbdu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">yesterday</a>, I drafted a letter to my US representative, who happens to be among the 100+ member <a href=\"https://progressives.house.gov/home\">Congressional Progressive Caucus</a>.

Really?)\n* Fed cuts rates this year and the ol' money printer starts a fresh risk asset bull run of sorts, extending through 2024 and the BTC halving with new crypto ATHs in 2024\n* EIP-4844 launches sometime in the 2nd half of 2023 and Arbitrum becomes insanely cheap before 2024\n* The new ARB DAO doesn't go nuts and the $ARB supply is around 2bn tokens ~1yr from now to make math easier ;)\n\nSo, the question is this: in what range does ARB circulating market cap top out during this upcoming bull market? \n\nSome rounded mcap high-water marks from last cycle:\n\n* SOL- $75bn\n* ADA- $95bn\n* MATIC- $20bn (I was surprised this was so low vs. others, tbh)\n* DOT- $55bn\n* SHIB- $40bn\n* AVAX- $30bn\n* UNI- $22bn\n\nSome factors working in ARB's favor:\n\n* Vibrant community and ecosystem\n* Good tech, consistent execution from the team\n* CEX on-ramps mostly in-place already, token will likely be listed on major US CEXes soon after launch (Alt-L1s didn't have this for much of last cycle)\n* Rollup security comparisons are in Arb's favor, OP apparently won't have proper fraud proofs for a year+\n\nSome factors working against ARB:\n\n* ZK rollups may steal spotlight, TBD on this. Arb's incumbent advantage may overpower zk appeal and 4844 may make TX cost a wash. \n* It's not used for gas, which reduces demand\n\nRanges I'm looking at:\n\n* **$20bn mcap, $10/ARB**- This is sort of my low-end range. ARB isn't trying to be an ETH killer so it won't be priced like one, nor is SBF pumping it with customer deposits on the sly, but it will still be a top-5 smart contract chain in terms of TVL and activity. Even a \"valueless governance token\" like UNI can crack the $20bn mcap level. $10 is also a very meme-able number to target and quite achievable *assuming new ATHs across many other digital assets*. \n\n* **$30bn mcap, $15/ARB**- I'm not sure that ARB will spend much time here but it's within the realm of possibility (again, assuming new crypto ATHs). AVAX and ARB have been very comparable in the past on various metrics and even though ARB isn't a gas token like AVAX is, I think the L2 narrative is very attractive post-4844 and could push ARB up to this level. \n\n* **$40-50bn mcap, $20-25/ARB**- I think this is starting to get pretty unlikely.

Arb&#39;s incumbent advantage may overpower zk appeal and 4844 may make TX cost a wash. </li>\n<li>It&#39;s not used for gas, which reduces demand</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ranges I&#39;m looking at:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>$20bn mcap, $10/ARB</strong>- This is sort of my low-end range. ARB isn&#39;t trying to be an ETH killer so it won&#39;t be priced like one, nor is SBF pumping it with customer deposits on the sly, but it will still be a top-5 smart contract chain in terms of TVL and activity. Even a &quot;valueless governance token&quot; like UNI can crack the $20bn mcap level. $10 is also a very meme-able number to target and quite achievable <em>assuming new ATHs across many other digital assets</em>. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>$30bn mcap, $15/ARB</strong>- I&#39;m not sure that ARB will spend much time here but it&#39;s within the realm of possibility (again, assuming new crypto ATHs). AVAX and ARB have been very comparable in the past on various metrics and even though ARB isn&#39;t a gas token like AVAX is, I think the L2 narrative is very attractive post-4844 and could push ARB up to this level. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>$40-50bn mcap, $20-25/ARB</strong>- I think this is starting to get pretty unlikely. A lot of things would need to end up in ARB&#39;s favor for it to reach this price point, and it would probably need to be the dominant L2 by a fair margin. The main scenario where I think this happens is one where ETH flips BTC and ETH-aligned projects like Arbitrum skyrocket accordingly. ZK networks would probably need to flop this year, and Optimism would need to continue to avoid the spotlight. </p></li>\n<li><p>Anything over $50bn mcap, &gt;$25/ARB- Euphoric top territory, might be here for a day or two at most <strong>if</strong> the previously-listed scenario plays out.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-17 06:31:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jckaonj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11tipbq","parent_id":"t3_11tipbq","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/proof-of-lake","body":"Love your work!
