I like DeFi. It is one of the real world use cases for Ethereum. I constantly indulge myself in almost passvie income it provides. I keep a spreadsheet of all my harvests and positions to make following my PnL easy.\n\nSometimes, for the positions that are not obvious, I do sit and make more detailed review. Today I checked if my Convex ETH/CRV position is still worth it, and I thought you might be interested in it as well. I hope it'll help some newbies in DeFi to understand what we do here.\n\nIt is tricky due to two reasons: high CRV inflation and Impermanent Loss impact.\n\nLet's start with IL:\n\nPosition started at 06.02.2022 with 7.53 ETH and 6397 CRV.\n\nIf held separately, it would be worth today:\n\n7.53 ETH + 6397 CRV \\* 0.00056282 ETH/CRV = 11.13 ETH\n\nToday's actuall positions is:\n\n5.44 ETH + 9447.46 CRV \\* 0.00056282 ETH/CRV = 10.75 ETH\n\n**IL impact = -0.38 ETH of 11.13 ETH -> 3.41% loss**\n\nThe other important factor is high CRV inflation. You might care only about price and not your market share, but this would introduce other complications down the line. So I always try and consider market dilution.\n\nToday's CRV inflation (just calculated myself) is\n\n(today's\\_liquidity\\_incentives\\_emission + today's\\_core\\_team\\_emission)\\*365/total\\_supply\n\n(548602+541643)\u00d7365\u00f71918480214 = 20.74%\n\n**CRV inflation impact: 20.74% \\* 9447.46 CRV = 1959 CRV (worth 1.1 ETH)**\n\nThis is how mouch of my rewards I'd like to reinvest into this position (but I did put it elswhere, might reconsider).\n\nNow the gains. I have made 22 harvests on that position. It sums up to 6453.71 USD or 3.15 ETH (this is sum of values at each harvest day).\n\nSo, over this year (profit - loss):\n\n**PnL: 3.15 - (0.38 + 1.1) = 1.67 ETH of 11.13 ETH = 15% real gain in ETH terms.**\n\nIt was worth it. For two reasons. First - whatever APR you obtain on your CRV, you should consider it being 20% less, because this is how much you (as a share holder) spend on incentives for users, having 15% over that is great. Second - you're getting high yield on your ETH part as well, which often is very hard to find.\n\nJust keep in mind, it is not ETH vs CRV case, I did want to hold some CRV and the question here is: was it worth it keeping it as LP with ETH, or was it better stake them separately?\n\nI hope it will be helpful and interesting to anyone.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>gm.

On the 16th of March, the exploiter refunded an affected user with 100 ETH, and on the 17th of March, 100 ETH was sent to the Ronin exploiter address (aka North Korean Lazarus, the funds have not moved. Has anyone called them about the incoming tx?). \n\nSo, let's start with what he did yesterday morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**S02E04 - The mysterious tx**\n\nu/Set1Less shared the [news](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ufzg6/comment/jco6hk1) that the hacker sent 3k ETH (worth $4.8 M) back to Euler. \n\nThis is great news, every ETH counts. But - many viewers are missing: \n\nAfter 3 hours of the 3 x 1k transaction, he sent another one.\n\nThis time, it was an empty tx. No ETH, no further tx data or message included. It's a mysterious tx. \n\nIf you want to check, here you go: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfa2a703767e3bfc854288dc5228c25bcde240bee8f1faac019c2f10ed2165b9d](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfa2a703767e3bfc854288dc5228c25bcde240bee8f1faac019c2f10ed2165b9d)\n\nEuler then sent some form of answer ([tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc72d8b553651500c88730573a9839f230a98273dba16d1aad2496c8916ab1d04)):   \n\"Thank you for returning a portion of the assets. The original offer still stands if you would like to continue by returning the funds. The reward for information will be removed immediately and all our investigations will be dropped.\"\n\nPure speculation and hopium from myself are, that there might be some backchannel communication and the hacker wanted some official communication from Euler. Remember, the first ultimatum from Euler was to send back the funds in 24 hours - the hacker let this ultimatum pass. I see hackers latest tx more like a push: \"I did my part, now, it's your turn!\" \n\nOver the whole period from the hack until now, there is not much communication from the Euler team to the public. Euler labs CEO wrote a thread on twitter ([tweet link #1](https://twitter.com/euler_mab/status/1636411170897956865)) and the head of risk ([tweet link #2](https://twitter.com/MacroMate8/status/1637199687915565058)) recently. Otherwise, great silence. Eulers communication is generally pretty harsh, and demanding to the hacker. Will this be helpful in getting the funds back? Who knows. Some affected users asked for a more forgiving tone and generally more communication (source: discord). But at the same time, I understand that they don't want to show their cards and they keep the pressure on the hacker, as the following tweet (see #1) was sent out the night before the refund:\n\n\"I want to thank the security experts who are working on leads for the investigation.\r  \n\rThere is little I can say publicly about this, but I want everyone to know that there is a large team of world-class individuals doing all they can night and day.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**S02E05 - Sunday**\n\nYou might ask, what happened today, March 19th? \n\nToday is Sunday, and the exploiter took a day off. \n\nNothing to report.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've got no education in psychology.

On the 16th of March, the exploiter refunded an affected user with 100 ETH, and on the 17th of March, 100 ETH was sent to the Ronin exploiter address (aka North Korean Lazarus, the funds have not moved. Has anyone called them about the incoming tx?). </p>\n\n<p>So, let&#39;s start with what he did yesterday morning.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>S02E04 - The mysterious tx</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Set1Less\">u/Set1Less</a> shared the <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ufzg6/comment/jco6hk1\">news</a> that the hacker sent 3k ETH (worth $4.8 M) back to Euler. </p>\n\n<p>This is great news, every ETH counts. But - many viewers are missing: </p>\n\n<p>After 3 hours of the 3 x 1k transaction, he sent another one.</p>\n\n<p>This time, it was an empty tx. No ETH, no further tx data or message included. It&#39;s a mysterious tx. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to check, here you go: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfa2a703767e3bfc854288dc5228c25bcde240bee8f1faac019c2f10ed2165b9d\">https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfa2a703767e3bfc854288dc5228c25bcde240bee8f1faac019c2f10ed2165b9d</a></p>\n\n<p>Euler then sent some form of answer (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc72d8b553651500c88730573a9839f230a98273dba16d1aad2496c8916ab1d04\">tx</a>):<br/>\n&quot;Thank you for returning a portion of the assets. The original offer still stands if you would like to continue by returning the funds. The reward for information will be removed immediately and all our investigations will be dropped.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Pure speculation and hopium from myself are, that there might be some backchannel communication and the hacker wanted some official communication from Euler. Remember, the first ultimatum from Euler was to send back the funds in 24 hours - the hacker let this ultimatum pass.

A fiat currency is basically an ERC-20 token with a governance mechanism attached to it, the question is who is the \"government\" and what does the governance system look like. So if you think that US dollar token was mismanaged you should use magic defi powers to instantly diversify into other tokens, for example some on-chain [local currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_currency) ERC-20 token (if their governance allows it) or a DAO token (again, if their governance allows it) or some minimized-governance stablecoin of the future. If we can have tokenization and open exchange infra then you could pay with any token in any location. If you hold a DAO token why not buy coffee with it by having it be seamlessly into a token the vendor actually wants. (But also perhaps the downside to this is a sort of hypermonetization, where ERC20 (and the network it is on) is at the center of all human interaction, which I am not at all certain is good.)\n\nThe whole Bitcoin \"will be everything\" is dystopian nonsense by people pumping their own bags.

So if you think that US dollar token was mismanaged you should use magic defi powers to instantly diversify into other tokens, for example some on-chain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_currency\">local currency</a> ERC-20 token (if their governance allows it) or a DAO token (again, if their governance allows it) or some minimized-governance stablecoin of the future. If we can have tokenization and open exchange infra then you could pay with any token in any location. If you hold a DAO token why not buy coffee with it by having it be seamlessly into a token the vendor actually wants. (But also perhaps the downside to this is a sort of hypermonetization, where ERC20 (and the network it is on) is at the center of all human interaction, which I am not at all certain is good.)</p>\n\n<p>The whole Bitcoin &quot;will be everything&quot; is dystopian nonsense by people pumping their own bags. I mean, just imagine a world where entities that have the most money are not the US or UK treasury but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC_h_tz44uw\">this dude</a> and some jacked carnivore bros from Bitcoin Conference panels. No thank you. We humans are developing more new ways to organize and interact and enshrining some 2008 computer algorithm turned-ideology as the crown jewel of human achievement is same as enshrining, say, scientology as ultimate view of the cosmos.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-19 19:36:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jcwjx35","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11vd15b","parent_id":"t3_11vd15b","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/skyfire-x","body":"Some years back there was this story of the Bitcoin time traveler.
