Some tax attorneys will even say that ETH-&gt;WETH is a taxable trade, even though that opens up a very stupid can of worms with the ETH bridged to various networks. </p>\n\n<p>I suppose there&#39;s probably no good way to calculate this if you hold cbETH in self-custody, either. Wallet trackers like Koinly aren&#39;t going to build in unique functionality to show you receiving cbETH &quot;rewards&quot; when the token doesn&#39;t rebase, so good luck to you if you self-custody cbETH and plan to pay taxes on the &quot;income&quot;.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-20 04:06:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jcxpdpb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11waa98","parent_id":"t1_jcxbnal","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"hmm yes I suppose the slightly speculative nature of rETH does make a difference","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>hmm yes I suppose the slightly speculative nature of rETH does make a difference</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-20 04:35:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jcxryt8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11waa98","parent_id":"t1_jcxpdpb","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Savage_X","body":"I have to imagine whatever Coinbase is doing is because they think they need to do it to be compliant with security regs.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have to imagine whatever Coinbase is doing is because they think they need to do it to be compliant with security regs.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-20 15:49:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jd0fjyf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11waa98","parent_id":"t1_jcxpdpb","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Drew41","body":"Maybe Coinbase will have their own tax shenanigans (tax you every three days if you hold cbETH on their exchange), but I have extremely high certainly rETH is not taxed until you sell it. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason for it to be taxed if it\u2019s value is simply increasing.
