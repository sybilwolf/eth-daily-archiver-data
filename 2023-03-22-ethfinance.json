Happy to keep the conversation going today.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for everyone\u2019s comments yesterday on my $ARB valuation post. </p>\n\n<p>To summarize my thinking on $ARB value and to respond to some counterpoints:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  As far as competitors, I think $OP is over-valued, and frankly using relative valuation as a guide for growthy, speculative assets with no real claim on the earnings just doesn\u2019t do it for me.  This has a huge impact on people\u2019s opinions when they go to buy something though (e.g., \u201cIf $ADA is worth x, then this <em>has</em> to be worth at least y.\u201d), so I\u2019m kinda wrong here in a way. </li>\n<li>  The point is well taken that the L2 ecosystem isn\u2019t really that competitive as I argued, but the \u201cscaling\u201d ecosystem (huge air quotes) is certainly competitive and I think that detracts from the bull case for $ARB even if that isn\u2019t really fair, technically speaking.</li>\n<li>  I think the bull case for $ARB is just that it\u2019s a high beta bet on Ethereum. Longing the gov token of the largest scaling player could really ride a wave of momentum when a bull market starts. Or not, who knows. This is the most interesting case to me though. Could make a lot of people very rich. I don\u2019t think it needs to get any more complicated than \u201cI have a big bag of ETH, and I know that when it runs, I want some small positions in stuff that will absolutely fly so I can make more money.\u201d</li>\n<li>  Another case is that people are truly invested in the governance and will hold even at a monster valuation. I have a lot of issues with the pay-to-play nature of token governance and it\u2019s clear that anything above $1 is paying out the nose for that right. Even just holding onto the airdrop to vote is going to incur a lot of taxes for Americans if it\u2019s above $1.</li>\n<li>  FDV has to be taken seriously for these projects with long term roadmaps. Sure, come Thursday, the float will technically be the market cap, but if a company said in earnings, \u201cBtw, we plan to issue 1000% of our shares outstanding over the next five years to compensate employees, reward investors, and attract users.\u201d, that would be an eye watering amount to stomach. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just food for thought.

Generally I DCA into eth monthly or weekly depending on circumstances, but I definitely look at charts often enough (daily) to actually buy on most of the down days. I&#39;ve been doing something similar with LooksRare for the last year where I sell on 10% up and buy on 10% down (gas dependant) with some of the profit being dumped into their yield machine. I should really consider 5% and do some numbers around gas and staking cost. \ud83e\udd14</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-22 03:12:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jd77dvp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11y8xk3","parent_id":"t1_jd75jrc","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/physalisx","body":"Reading stuff like this to me is a little like reading how gamblers explain their foolproof Roulette betting strategy...\n\nI know this is a bitter pill to swallow for many, even here, but here it goes: \n\nNo, you don't gain more with your \"DCA strategy\".

When WW1 broke out America was the biggest seller of the tools of war, and they only accepted gold as payment. That made them the largest holder of gold in the world. Then WW2 happened and most countries had to take their money off the gold standard and borrow from the US to fund the war. It even forced the English to borrow and destroyed the British Pound. Then after WW2, 44 nations got together and signed the Bretton Woods Agreement which made the dollar the reserve currency. It made sense at the time, the dollar was backed by the world\u2019s largest gold reserves. Because of that people needed a safe place to keep all those dollars, so they bought Treasury securities which were thought to be a safe store of money.</p>\n\n<p>Then America entered the Vietnam War and started their \u201cGreat Society\u201d domestic programs. This amount of spending caused them to fire up the money printer to cover the bills. This dramatic inflation caused concern and nations started trading their dollars for gold, so Nixon took us off the \u201cgold standard\u201d and made it so dollars didn\u2019t equal gold anymore\u2026 and so now we have this terrible \u201cfloating exchange rate\u201d thing going on. </p>\n\n<p>So\u2026 anyway, really nowadays the dollar\u2019s value is based on the US\u2019s dominance in finance and it\u2019s strong economy. Oh and guns. Big guns. Lots of really big guns.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-22 06:57:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jd7vo02","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11y8xk3","parent_id":"t1_jd7qgi3","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProfStrangelove","body":"I think you forgot to mention guns!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think you forgot to mention guns!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-22 07:17:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jd7yk26","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11y8xk3","parent_id":"t1_jd7vo02","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Oh, he mentioned guns alright.

You are blaming them for talking about politics and doomer macro economics, but crypto Twitter and this sub are also full of that the last couple of months. Bankless covers whatever has the mindspace in crypto. They might not be the most critical interviewers but they try to make sure to bring on guests from all sides of the story. Recently I really enjoyed their episodes with Hester Pearce and the one with Brian Armstrong.\nIf you want technology, they cover that too. David has done many great interviews at Starkware Sessions and EthDenver. Can highly recommend all of it.</p>\n\n<p>I think we all just miss the time when crypto as a whole was about fun technology and new protocols instead of politics and macro economics.

I understand why people need religion and why bitcoiners almost welcome it, by necessity. As do with cults they have stickiness\u2026 at least for the time spans they last. </p>\n\n<p>But like all religions, Bitcoin the religion will topple and fall, and will itself have to go through change and reformations, like most religion do. And it itself will splinter, and some of its children will rise to prominence and morph and find their own place, sometimes besting their fore bearers. </p>\n\n<p>But better yet while some religions last, it may be supplanted by an increasing trust in scienctific progress, which is actually what advances the world, because it relies on a fluidity fueled by critique, not dogma. Facades fall over time. Bitcoin the religion will have its Copernican/Galileo moment and the illusion will shatter.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-22 09:34:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jd8ju4t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11y8xk3","parent_id":"t1_jd8ctts","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-22 09:39:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jd8kj7h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11y8xk3","parent_id":"t1_jd8ju4t","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/okmolok","body":"Faith can also be supplanted by logic.
