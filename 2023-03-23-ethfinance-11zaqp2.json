Very happy to get a nice drop for pioneering L2 tech!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Fun anecdote: I lost 1 ETH (worth quite a bit more at the time) to arbinyan shenanigans and kinda held it against myself and the arbinyan anon dev for a while.  Then that same anon dev created Zipswap on Optimism and I was able to make that 1 eth back and then some by participating in that little venture.  The only difference between arbinyan and zipswap was that I didn&#39;t let greed take hold.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-23 12:27:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jde7ksj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11zaqp2","parent_id":"t1_jde43p8","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/ZeroTricks","body":"On this day...\n\nIn 2022:\n\n- GameStop [launches](https://medium.loopring.io/gamestop-nft-marketplace-powered-by-loopring-l2-6cdb9289d937) its NFT Marketplace in beta, in partnership with zk-Rollup based Ethereum Layer 2 Loopring.\n- ETH injects zeroes in numbers like $3030, or \u20bf0.0707.\n\n\nIn 2021:\n\n- Uniswap [presents](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3) v3, up to 4000x more capital efficient and featuring Concentrated Liquidity positions, allowing liquidity providers to set price ranges.\n- Ethworks [introduces](https://medium.com/ethworks/introducing-usedapp-framework-for-rapid-dapp-development-4959361f242a) framework for rapid DApp development useDApp.\n- Coinbase Pro [announces](https://blog.coinbase.com/ankr-ankr-curve-dao-token-crv-and-storj-storj-are-launching-on-coinbase-pro-62dbd9208d7c) support for ANKR, CRV and STORJ.\n- ETH counts the beans at $1679, or \u20bf0.03067.\n\n\nIn 2020:\n\n- Uniswap [v2](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2) is launched on all testnets, with pure ERC20 pairs, price oracles and flash swaps.\n- ZenGo [sounds the alarm](https://zengo.com/badapprove-defi-security) on \"baDAPProve\", or how attackers can abuse approved, but highly excessive privileges to steal users tokens.\n- ETH rediscovers its wings from $124 to $135, at \u20bf0.021.\n\n\nIn 2019:\n\n- As if ETH needs stablecoins at $138, or \u20bf0.03429.\n\n\nIn 2018:\n\n- Basic Attention Token is the first ERC-20 token [to become](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/86ls1f/bat_is_now_an_apple_verified_virtual_currency/) an Apple verified virtual currency.\n- Ethereum Improvement Proposal site [eips.ethereum.org](http://eips.ethereum.org) goes live;

Although cryptocurrencies currently serve each of these functions, they only do so in limited ways in the United States, so they do not serve, from an economic perspective, as an effective alternative to the U.S. dollar. For the first monetary function question, cryptocurrencies can serve as a unit of account, given that the relative values of goods and services can be expressed in cryptocurrency (e.g., a single chicken in commerce is worth roughly 0.0001 bitcoin). However, individuals would likely need to first convert bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies to dollars to understand relative values as cryptocurrencies are not as effective as the U.S. dollar as a medium of exchange. Thus, cryptocurrencies currently do not fully serve as units of account. The second question is whether cryptocurrencies can serve as a medium of exchange. The answer is that in the United States, they are not as effective a medium of exchange as the U.S. dollar. This is because they can be used to purchase other cryptocurrencies and to buy goods and services at a smaller number of firms relative to the U.S. dollar . The strength of the U.S. dollar is derived from several important factors, such as faith in government institutions and the legal system, but cryptocurrencies lack these factors. Third, cryptocurrencies currently experience substantial amounts of volatility, and thus are not stable stores of value. For example, the value of a bitcoin (relative to the U.S. dollar) increased by over 1,000 percent from March 2019 to March 2021, and then decreased by over 70 percent from November 2021 to October 2022. This volatility means that anyone who is using bitcoins to store their savings is subject to high-volatility risk in their purchasing power. The volatility of cryptocurrencies outpaces those of many other financial asset types.
