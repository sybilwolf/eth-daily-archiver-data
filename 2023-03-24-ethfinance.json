Soil health and biodiversity are the advantages I'm referring to which I have already discussed.\n\n>This also isn't necessarily true, you're describing one, worst-case scenario and applying it to an entire, very broad industry. Use of cover crops and no-till production of plant milks is entirely feasible; oats themselves ARE A cover crop used to stabilise and improve soil structure and biology.

Almost all pastures and hay meadows are not the ecological havens that the dairy industry pretends they are, and also get sprayed by fertilisers and pesticides, and a lot of milk doesn't even come from this source, it comes from cows in sheds being fed unsustainably grown soya.\n\nYep, that's why oats are popular in some diverse pasture mix. Cows like them too and they can also graze on what's left after an oat cover crop harvest. Another interesting crop which cows do great with is hemp. It sequesters carbon faster than pine trees, it's deep rooting good for soil structure, super high protein seeds which can be harvested (higher than chicken per gram) and cows love to eat what's left over. No need to turn it over into the soil afterwards that way.\n\n>Half the world is currently fed by synthetic fertilisers, including (very inefficiently) most of the world's dairy cows. They don't just magically produce nutrients; anything they poo out, they ate, and most of what they eat is wasted on respiration.\n\nYes and we need to wean ourselves off them. But that last bit is wrong. Cows are giant bioreactors. Here are a few points regarding this:\n\n- Their urine is incredibly high in N and K. So much so that nutrients running off from urine are as big of a concern as artificial fertiliser runoff is. But this is very manageable with riparian planting, less intensive grazing and longer diverse pastures. So we can have some of the benefits of artificial fertilisers without the downsides and while maintaining microbiological diversity.\n\n- Cows don't add new nutrients to the system. They make it readily available for plants to uptake again with the help of a wide range of micro-organisms which aren't present without them. Microbiological diversity in soil is one of the key things we need to build back up to improve soil fertility in a post artificial fertiliser world since they help make soil organic matter readily available for plant uptake again.\n\nFinally, on your point about respiration, that's carbon being emitted by cows which otherwise would've been emitted by the micro-organisms which break down dead plant matter when what the cow ate would've died anyway. So that's no more wasted with cows than it is with plants.\n\n>I strongly, strongly doubt this statistic, and even if true, it is nothing more than whataboutism when far more sustainable alternatives exist. And as soon as you start talking about alternative feeds for cows, that environmental footprint gets ignored for some reason.\n\nHere's my source on that stat: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22178852/\n\nIt's by no means an excuse for the methane emissions in agriculture, but it's more to show that these emissions are perfectly acceptable and balanced in a closed system free of fossil fuels.\n\nThe alternative feeds I'm referring to are basically just grass/silage and diverse pastures along with the still developing research into seaweed supplements which can reduce excess enteric fermentation that produces methane.\n\n>You've taken the best, often theoretical case as the baseline for ruminants, and the worst-case for plants here. Ruminants can be a useful tool in soil health when utilised properly, but are absolutely not critical, this right here is propaganda spread by the powerful sponsors of the meat & dairy industries.\n\nYou're right, critical was hyperbole on my part. They clearly aren't critical and in the USA big industry hardly even utilises the benefits since most cattle are fed crops and feed rather than pasture. But that doesn't mean they're still not an amazing tool for soil health when done right. I'm also aware that I'm comparing an idea scenario here where few dairy farms use the practices I'm discussing. However, it's the same with your plant examples. In reality, most growers are still high tillage with limited rotations and cover crops. I just never see anyone discussing what dairy farming *should* look like. It's always bashing the status quo (and rightfully so). I'm not advocating for dairy in its current state. I actually get very frustrated driving past certain parts of NZ because of all the incredibly bad management practices I can see. I'm advocating for what I've seen on some of the pilot farms in my region. The difference is quite incredible sometimes.\n\n>The amount of bush cleared for grazing in NZ is an environmental disaster and you're looking at it with rose-tinted glasses while again assuming the worst-case about plants, despite huge amounts of plant material being used to feed livestock.

We all need to scale back on our animal product consumption, there's no doubt about it. Animal agriculture is way too intensive.

This has been productive for me as soil and ag studies here in NZ can be more animal focused than elsewhere due to dairy being our biggest industry and while most of the researchers I'm in contact with are heavily motivated by environmental reasons, that doesn't make them immune to biases. So it's good to hear from someone that's more in tune with the strictly plant side of things.\n\nEdit: I can't believe I said this will have to be a quick response and then proceeded to write that. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This will have to be a quick response from me as it&#39;s nearly 3 am. Damn you Arbitrum for making me stay up late last night and not tired tonight.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This just isn&#39;t true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those are three metrics. Soil health and biodiversity are the advantages I&#39;m referring to which I have already discussed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This also isn&#39;t necessarily true, you&#39;re describing one, worst-case scenario and applying it to an entire, very broad industry. Use of cover crops and no-till production of plant milks is entirely feasible; oats themselves ARE A cover crop used to stabilise and improve soil structure and biology. And almost all dairy pastures are similarly monocultural, and require much, much more land due to the inefficiency of putting plants through an animal rather than consuming plants directly. Almost all pastures and hay meadows are not the ecological havens that the dairy industry pretends they are, and also get sprayed by fertilisers and pesticides, and a lot of milk doesn&#39;t even come from this source, it comes from cows in sheds being fed unsustainably grown soya.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yep, that&#39;s why oats are popular in some diverse pasture mix. Cows like them too and they can also graze on what&#39;s left after an oat cover crop harvest. Another interesting crop which cows do great with is hemp. It sequesters carbon faster than pine trees, it&#39;s deep rooting good for soil structure, super high protein seeds which can be harvested (higher than chicken per gram) and cows love to eat what&#39;s left over. No need to turn it over into the soil afterwards that way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Half the world is currently fed by synthetic fertilisers, including (very inefficiently) most of the world&#39;s dairy cows. They don&#39;t just magically produce nutrients; anything they poo out, they ate, and most of what they eat is wasted on respiration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes and we need to wean ourselves off them. But that last bit is wrong. Cows are giant bioreactors. Here are a few points regarding this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Their urine is incredibly high in N and K. So much so that nutrients running off from urine are as big of a concern as artificial fertiliser runoff is. But this is very manageable with riparian planting, less intensive grazing and longer diverse pastures. So we can have some of the benefits of artificial fertilisers without the downsides and while maintaining microbiological diversity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cows don&#39;t add new nutrients to the system. They make it readily available for plants to uptake again with the help of a wide range of micro-organisms which aren&#39;t present without them. Microbiological diversity in soil is one of the key things we need to build back up to improve soil fertility in a post artificial fertiliser world since they help make soil organic matter readily available for plant uptake again.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, on your point about respiration, that&#39;s carbon being emitted by cows which otherwise would&#39;ve been emitted by the micro-organisms which break down dead plant matter when what the cow ate would&#39;ve died anyway. So that&#39;s no more wasted with cows than it is with plants.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I strongly, strongly doubt this statistic, and even if true, it is nothing more than whataboutism when far more sustainable alternatives exist. And as soon as you start talking about alternative feeds for cows, that environmental footprint gets ignored for some reason.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s my source on that stat: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22178852/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22178852/</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s by no means an excuse for the methane emissions in agriculture, but it&#39;s more to show that these emissions are perfectly acceptable and balanced in a closed system free of fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative feeds I&#39;m referring to are basically just grass/silage and diverse pastures along with the still developing research into seaweed supplements which can reduce excess enteric fermentation that produces methane.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You&#39;ve taken the best, often theoretical case as the baseline for ruminants, and the worst-case for plants here. Ruminants can be a useful tool in soil health when utilised properly, but are absolutely not critical, this right here is propaganda spread by the powerful sponsors of the meat &amp; dairy industries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re right, critical was hyperbole on my part. They clearly aren&#39;t critical and in the USA big industry hardly even utilises the benefits since most cattle are fed crops and feed rather than pasture. But that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re still not an amazing tool for soil health when done right. I&#39;m also aware that I&#39;m comparing an idea scenario here where few dairy farms use the practices I&#39;m discussing. However, it&#39;s the same with your plant examples. In reality, most growers are still high tillage with limited rotations and cover crops. I just never see anyone discussing what dairy farming <em>should</em> look like. It&#39;s always bashing the status quo (and rightfully so). I&#39;m not advocating for dairy in its current state. I actually get very frustrated driving past certain parts of NZ because of all the incredibly bad management practices I can see. I&#39;m advocating for what I&#39;ve seen on some of the pilot farms in my region. The difference is quite incredible sometimes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The amount of bush cleared for grazing in NZ is an environmental disaster and you&#39;re looking at it with rose-tinted glasses while again assuming the worst-case about plants, despite huge amounts of plant material being used to feed livestock. Without animal agriculture, we wouldn&#39;t just need much less pasture, and be able to focus on properly conserving the important grasslands, we would also need less arable.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst some mitigation of the pollution from pastures is good, let&#39;s not ignore the fact that producing plant-based alternatives requires much, much less land and water, meaning many of those fields aren&#39;t even needed for agriculture at all and can return to somewhat native bush. Riparian buffers, diverse and rotational crop planting and no-till, low-impact production of plants, and use of extremely powerful cover crops are entirely applicable and important in arable farming and you&#39;ve completely ignored them whilst emphasizing the limited and at times completely unscalable mitigators of animal agriculture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is all largely true. We all need to scale back on our animal product consumption, there&#39;s no doubt about it. Animal agriculture is way too intensive. But on the other hand, turning an old dairy farm into pine trees and cornfields as is a common story here doesn&#39;t help much either. The only metric it will help with is carbon emissions at the expense of diversity and soil health. The better solution would be a low intensity hybrid farming system with short mob grazing on half of the farm with the rest of it in low till rotational cropping and slowly rotating what&#39;s on the animal side and what&#39;s on the arable side.

And if you&#39;re comparing lentils and beans to meat then yeah there&#39;s probably not much difference and that&#39;s probably going to be a healthy vege option.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, diet studies are incredibly hard to perform fairly and it&#39;s not my field of expertise so take it with a grain of salt. But there is significant evidence that processed foods and polyunsaturated fats like vegetable oils are problematic. So my guiding principles are generally just to stick to food products which have been in our diet for thousands of years. I&#39;ve seen some of these plant food products being made at the food tech lab and they&#39;re more processed than sausages. If you ate the raw ingredients you wouldn&#39;t be having a good time.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-24 15:37:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jdjvwkq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_120axdk","parent_id":"t1_jdhlvt6","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/-lightfoot","body":">you\u2019re not right about the soil part.\n\nYes they are.

None of these resemble animals whatsoever and it is entirely impossible to see how they are made even under best practice because the process is deemed too abhorrently disgusting on many levels for the public to be allowed to see. The most significant difference between these (and red meat) and plant-based proceesed proteins being that the former are proven carcinogens.\n\nI mentioned these already. They're absolutely junk food. All I was trying to say is that I can't see any evidence not to put half of the processed plant based foods in the same tier. The issue I have is not with the plant based options themselves, people can eat what they want and the more options the better. I just get really put off by the marketing surrounding them which tends to put them up on a pedestal as healthier than any form of meat which is hard to believe. Also, the evidence of red meat being carcinogenic is very often lumped in with processed products. Bacon is \"red meat\" but it's also more than just the meat from the animal. There's also health benefits to red meats which aren't mentioned like the more diverse amino acid composition which better matches what our body needs as well as haem iron which is many times easier for our body to take up than non-haem iron and iron deficiencies are very common nowadays with people who abstain from meat. Yet it doesn't take much meat (way less than the average diet) to avoid iron deficiency which play into my thoughts that we should be eating less meat, just not abstaining on a societal level.\n\n>(although veggie sausages that are actually just vegetables are delicious and much much more nutritious than pork sausages and aren't carcinogenic).\n\nMaybe I'm wrong here but veggie sausages haven't been around in large enough numbers long enough to study if they're carcinogenic. When I look at the ingredients list of them 9 times out of 10 it's as long and ugly as meat sausages. But sure, if the jury is still out then they can edge out ahead of sausages. As I said above, it's more the disconnect with the product and the marketing I see which bothers me.\n\n>None of this has anything to do with plant-based diets. You need to stop disproportionately associating the consumption of plant food with the consumption of processed food. I eat similar or smaller amounts of processed foods than my omnivorous friends.\n\nI guess this is just from my personal experience again which is definitely biased. I eat very little processed meats but about 2/3rds of the plant alternatives I see my veggie friends and girlfriend eat are processed. Maybe it's biased due to the people I know or maybe it's due to there being less options which aren't processed. I don't know but there certainly are ways to be healthy on a vegetarian diet. Once again I guess it's just the disconnect between marketing and how I actually see such products consumed.\n\n>Why can I go for a tour to see how cider is made, or how bread is made, but not where we get our steaks and bacon? Because the process, even by best-practice standards, is absolutely appalling.\n\nYou're right when it comes to factory farms but also, there are more factors than just that. There are extra health and safety issues involved with touring a beef or dairy farm. Biohazards, trampling hazards, the unpredictability of animals. It's just not going to happen in today's health and safety crazed world. I don't think most people would be upset touring an NZ dairy farm. In fact one of the ones I worked on often had guests around who aren't in the industry but are connected to the university in some way like foreign students and management people. Though this is probably another source of bias for me. I know that I would not cope well touring an american meat farm. Hence I only bought vege and seafood at Hodlercon in Hawaii.\n\n>Then you are advocating broadly for veganism. The systems you are advocating do not scale to meet demand, that's why factory farming exists. For what you're advocating to be at all realistic, people would need to eat almost no animal products. The world's population has gone from 2 billion to 8 billion in 2 generations, and your grandparents probably at 1 chicken a week. The idealistic ideas of animal farming are being used to cover up over an industry driven by grossly unsustainable and deeply unethical practices, most of which are impossible to find any information about because it is deliberately concealed. \n\nI'm once again biased by the low population density here and spending time in the UK made me realise how little farmland there is for every village or town. But I'm not sure the situation is that dire. Population is no longer growing by any significant amount in the west. If we removed 50% of animal agriculture we would still have plenty of meat in our diet and we could go from factory farming to more traditional methods. If we adopt the right practices I think there's enough evidence to say that we could have better environmental results *(excluding GHG) on a local level than if the whole world moved to plant based everything (sure, that's still very debatable but I guess that's why I'm on this path to find out). The average person also doesn't have the ability to eat healthily to begin with and eating healthily on a vegan diet is even harder. It requires a lot of understanding and management (though this isn't really a problem for vegetarianism). \n\nTo conclude I think one of my main driving factors is the unease with which I always approach -isms, absolutes and bold claims.

None of these resemble animals whatsoever and it is entirely impossible to see how they are made even under best practice because the process is deemed too abhorrently disgusting on many levels for the public to be allowed to see. The most significant difference between these (and red meat) and plant-based proceesed proteins being that the former are proven carcinogens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mentioned these already. They&#39;re absolutely junk food. All I was trying to say is that I can&#39;t see any evidence not to put half of the processed plant based foods in the same tier. The issue I have is not with the plant based options themselves, people can eat what they want and the more options the better. I just get really put off by the marketing surrounding them which tends to put them up on a pedestal as healthier than any form of meat which is hard to believe. Also, the evidence of red meat being carcinogenic is very often lumped in with processed products. Bacon is &quot;red meat&quot; but it&#39;s also more than just the meat from the animal. There&#39;s also health benefits to red meats which aren&#39;t mentioned like the more diverse amino acid composition which better matches what our body needs as well as haem iron which is many times easier for our body to take up than non-haem iron and iron deficiencies are very common nowadays with people who abstain from meat. Yet it doesn&#39;t take much meat (way less than the average diet) to avoid iron deficiency which play into my thoughts that we should be eating less meat, just not abstaining on a societal level.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>(although veggie sausages that are actually just vegetables are delicious and much much more nutritious than pork sausages and aren&#39;t carcinogenic).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe I&#39;m wrong here but veggie sausages haven&#39;t been around in large enough numbers long enough to study if they&#39;re carcinogenic. When I look at the ingredients list of them 9 times out of 10 it&#39;s as long and ugly as meat sausages. But sure, if the jury is still out then they can edge out ahead of sausages. As I said above, it&#39;s more the disconnect with the product and the marketing I see which bothers me.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>None of this has anything to do with plant-based diets. You need to stop disproportionately associating the consumption of plant food with the consumption of processed food. I eat similar or smaller amounts of processed foods than my omnivorous friends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess this is just from my personal experience again which is definitely biased. I eat very little processed meats but about 2/3rds of the plant alternatives I see my veggie friends and girlfriend eat are processed. Maybe it&#39;s biased due to the people I know or maybe it&#39;s due to there being less options which aren&#39;t processed. I don&#39;t know but there certainly are ways to be healthy on a vegetarian diet. Once again I guess it&#39;s just the disconnect between marketing and how I actually see such products consumed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why can I go for a tour to see how cider is made, or how bread is made, but not where we get our steaks and bacon? Because the process, even by best-practice standards, is absolutely appalling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re right when it comes to factory farms but also, there are more factors than just that. There are extra health and safety issues involved with touring a beef or dairy farm. Biohazards, trampling hazards, the unpredictability of animals. It&#39;s just not going to happen in today&#39;s health and safety crazed world. I don&#39;t think most people would be upset touring an NZ dairy farm. In fact one of the ones I worked on often had guests around who aren&#39;t in the industry but are connected to the university in some way like foreign students and management people. Though this is probably another source of bias for me. I know that I would not cope well touring an american meat farm. Hence I only bought vege and seafood at Hodlercon in Hawaii.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then you are advocating broadly for veganism. The systems you are advocating do not scale to meet demand, that&#39;s why factory farming exists. For what you&#39;re advocating to be at all realistic, people would need to eat almost no animal products. The world&#39;s population has gone from 2 billion to 8 billion in 2 generations, and your grandparents probably at 1 chicken a week. The idealistic ideas of animal farming are being used to cover up over an industry driven by grossly unsustainable and deeply unethical practices, most of which are impossible to find any information about because it is deliberately concealed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m once again biased by the low population density here and spending time in the UK made me realise how little farmland there is for every village or town. But I&#39;m not sure the situation is that dire. Population is no longer growing by any significant amount in the west. If we removed 50% of animal agriculture we would still have plenty of meat in our diet and we could go from factory farming to more traditional methods. If we adopt the right practices I think there&#39;s enough evidence to say that we could have better environmental results *(excluding GHG) on a local level than if the whole world moved to plant based everything (sure, that&#39;s still very debatable but I guess that&#39;s why I&#39;m on this path to find out). The average person also doesn&#39;t have the ability to eat healthily to begin with and eating healthily on a vegan diet is even harder. It requires a lot of understanding and management (though this isn&#39;t really a problem for vegetarianism). </p>\n\n<p>To conclude I think one of my main driving factors is the unease with which I always approach -isms, absolutes and bold claims.

I've already explained why I think this and am still learning about this so I'm going to leave that here for now so we don't go on forever.\n\n>Much of what you are saying stems from deeply rooted tropes that have been aggressively spread and reinforced by a multi trillion meat industry that spends tens of millions a year aggressively lobbying government, suppressing science, and funding psuedo-science to the contrary, a la tobacco companies in the 20th century.\n\n>Let\u2019s do that - junk food is junk food - it's not an issue for plant based diets more than non. Very likely less. Be careful not to create false equivalences where more nuance exists. Processed meat is by and large far worse for you than processed plants.\n\nSadly I don't have enough time to review the entire thing but some points on this.\n\n- I am aware of the lobbying and I have to be constantly aware of it. There is some clear bullshit being spouted. This does go both ways, though I do feel the meat industry lobbies harder. However as far as I can tell I'm not basing my opinions on this. Obviously scientific literature still has its biases and funding organisations but I try to be critical of these things.\n\n- That article points out that meats are high in saturated fats - high cholesterol = unhealthy. This idea has been around for as long as carbs being good and fats being bad. But recent research is yet to fully prove this relationship past correlation. On the other hand, new research is showing that polyunsaturated fats are very unhealthy too. They're easier to oxidise than saturated or monounsaturated fats which in short makes them lower quality for use in the mitochondria. Furthermore, there are very few natural sources of polyunsaturated fats in our ancient diets. They primarily come from highly processed seed oils in the modern diet and there is a strong correlation between the rise of heart disease and human consumption of polyunsaturated fats in our diet which is as strong as the saturated fats and heart disease relationship. My point here is not to say that saturated fats are good and seed oils bad. I can't prove that. There are huge amounts of evidence for both sides of this debate yet they common consensus is still that saturated fats are bad which dates back to the wrong assumptions of carbs in our diet being good. So from this hard to conclude either way situation, we have either a product which is highly processed and has only been in our diets for 100 years or a product we have been eating for millennia. Can you understand why I'm hesitant to accept the idea that it's not the novel, highly refined product that is in our diets being the problem? The only exception here is plant based products with monounsaturated fats like olive oil, coconut oil and palm oil (though the environmental issue of that last one...). These are the only fats which are basically proven to be healthy at this point. However, almost every plant based alternative I take a look at contains high levels of polyunsaturated fats. This is why my fav vegetarian proteins are beans, lentils, mycoprotein and eggs.\n\n- That study you linked seems to deem a factor of healthiness of PB-ABAs as \"low in saturated fats\" without looking into what is there instead of the saturated fats and if the assumption that saturated fats are bad is even true to begin with. it also mentions PBAs being high in iron but makes no mention of how readily available that iron is to uptake for the human body. Haem iron is multiple times easier for the body to uptake than non-haem iron. (not that iron alone is enough to edge meats ahead or anything. my point here is simply to criticise some assumptions or oversights made in the study.\n\n- Finally, one of the referenced studies in this lit review (Van Vliet et al. (2021)) concludes the following: \"The authors do not argue that one is healthier than the other, but that they have different (and perhaps complementary) metabolomic profiles.\" Which is entirely my point here. I think diversity is better than absolutes.\n\n- This is neither here or there, but I was please to see it. While there is significant evidence of vegetable proteins lacking the amino acid diversity needed to build human muscle, Rodgers (2001) showed that mycoprotein does contain all of them which is cool as this is my favourite of the processed PB-ABAs. (My gf and I love Quorn mince and I saw it for the first time in NZ just last week!!!)\n\n>This argument is very tired and is just not true, meat eaters are just as often it not more likely to be deficient in iron. non-haem iron as a supplement or not can be readily converted to haem.\n\nBut it is true that haem iron is substantially easier for the body to uptake. You don't want to be taking supplements if you can avoid it and there simple are less vegetarian iron sources. This isn't a particularly significant argument overall though as you can just take supplements or plan what you're eating a bit more.\n\n>Ok, maybe mashed up vegetables are carcinogenic. But you're comparing real evidence that processed and red meats are carcinogenic to an entirely unfounded hypothesis that mashed up plants are carcinogenic here. Why? because they're shaped the same as meat sausages? I feel like you're being influenced by preconceived biases here when there's no evidence or logic for mashed up plants to be carcinogenic.\n\nMaybe. My point here wasn't to claim they're worse than processed meat. It was just to point out they aren't great. Furthermore, the one thing you'll find in almost all vege sausages is polyunsaturated fats. So that's big in my decision making and biases too.\n\n>Again, consumer choice; veggie sausages comprised entirely of just vegetables and seasoning are easy to find and are very healthy and tasty - so please stop applying generalisations to a massively varied range of products all of which didn't exist even a few years ago and are improving very rapidly. They are also generally more healthy and more environmentally friendly. You can choose to be suspicious of them if you like but that isn't a view founded in science, it\u2019s dogma. Apply that same cycicism to animal agriculture and products please.\n\nIt doesn't help that the plant based aisle over here is tiny. I cannot access such products in my local supermarkets. Only through specialist suppliers so that's had an effect on my perception here.\n\nAgain, the methods of defining environmentally friendliness on the whole is a win over meat but as I've previously explained I believe there is merit to a mixed agriculture system for local ecosystems which can still be better for the environment if we do it right. You don't need to reply to this. I know what you're going to say and most environmental metrics based on current systems definitely shows PB to be better. You're right. But this is where my idea of a less intensive animal agriculture isn't really reflected in current evidence because current practices aren't anywhere near optimised enough for anything other than max production. But what I've seen at research stations here in NZ with diverse pastures, riparian planting and new things like applying nitrification inhibitors or gibberellins over urine and dung patches to prevent N2O emissions, N leaching and improve pasture growth significantly on land which largely isn't well suited to cropping can yield overall better results when you consider animal, wildlife and dietary diversity as benefits too. I hope within 20 years time I will have a reasonable idea if what I've been working on has been beneficial or if I was wrong all along and we should've been pivoting to cropping from the get-go.\n\n>Right.. The reason the public are not allowed in a slaughterhouse or an intensive chicken rearing shed is because of biohazards. Not because it would scar them for life and stop them buying any meat. I have been in many of these and they are absolutely appaling, and they have to be due to the demand they meet. Suicide and psychological harm are disproportionately high among slaughterhouse workers.\n\nI think you're thinking I'm advocating for factory farming which is 100% not the case. I was talking about touring a dairy farm or a free range chicken farm. With a less intensive meat industry a lot of the burdens on slaughterhouse workers are reduced. Admittedly I'm not an expert in this field but as someone who has gutted and butchered goats and deer I have hunted, there is nothing inherently scarring about the process itself. We have been doing it for millennia. The horrendous conditions are a result of profit driven enterprises and overly intensive farming. Put more regulations in place and lighten the work load and while I have no studies to back this up I would have thought that the industry wouldn't be so problematic. There has to be a middle ground between horrendous factories of scarred meat processors and me getting a new found appreciation for meat after dealing with an animal I stalked myself. Yes, meat prices would go up if we improved worker conditions and reduced intensification of agriculture but that's how you get the market to find a balance between less meat and more plants. For a start we just banned cage eggs in NZ and aside from an initial supply crunch, eggs are still relatively affordable and those who are priced out will likely be eating more PBPs. Now we just need to do the same for broiler chickens...\n\nTBC...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Fundamentally, this debate has to start, every single time, with the fact that we would need drastically less agricultural land overall, including arable land, if we all stopped eating animal products and this is by far the biggest environmental reason why a plant-based diet is something we should all work towards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t and don&#39;t deny this. I just lay in the middle ground where I think we should be growing more plants on less land but I still see evidence that animals can play a useful role on a smaller scale. I&#39;ve already explained why I think this and am still learning about this so I&#39;m going to leave that here for now so we don&#39;t go on forever.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Much of what you are saying stems from deeply rooted tropes that have been aggressively spread and reinforced by a multi trillion meat industry that spends tens of millions a year aggressively lobbying government, suppressing science, and funding psuedo-science to the contrary, a la tobacco companies in the 20th century.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s do that - junk food is junk food - it&#39;s not an issue for plant based diets more than non. Very likely less. Be careful not to create false equivalences where more nuance exists. Processed meat is by and large far worse for you than processed plants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sadly I don&#39;t have enough time to review the entire thing but some points on this.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I am aware of the lobbying and I have to be constantly aware of it. There is some clear bullshit being spouted. This does go both ways, though I do feel the meat industry lobbies harder. However as far as I can tell I&#39;m not basing my opinions on this. Obviously scientific literature still has its biases and funding organisations but I try to be critical of these things.</p></li>\n<li><p>That article points out that meats are high in saturated fats - high cholesterol = unhealthy. This idea has been around for as long as carbs being good and fats being bad. But recent research is yet to fully prove this relationship past correlation. On the other hand, new research is showing that polyunsaturated fats are very unhealthy too. They&#39;re easier to oxidise than saturated or monounsaturated fats which in short makes them lower quality for use in the mitochondria. Furthermore, there are very few natural sources of polyunsaturated fats in our ancient diets. They primarily come from highly processed seed oils in the modern diet and there is a strong correlation between the rise of heart disease and human consumption of polyunsaturated fats in our diet which is as strong as the saturated fats and heart disease relationship. My point here is not to say that saturated fats are good and seed oils bad. I can&#39;t prove that. There are huge amounts of evidence for both sides of this debate yet they common consensus is still that saturated fats are bad which dates back to the wrong assumptions of carbs in our diet being good. So from this hard to conclude either way situation, we have either a product which is highly processed and has only been in our diets for 100 years or a product we have been eating for millennia. Can you understand why I&#39;m hesitant to accept the idea that it&#39;s not the novel, highly refined product that is in our diets being the problem? The only exception here is plant based products with monounsaturated fats like olive oil, coconut oil and palm oil (though the environmental issue of that last one...). These are the only fats which are basically proven to be healthy at this point. However, almost every plant based alternative I take a look at contains high levels of polyunsaturated fats. This is why my fav vegetarian proteins are beans, lentils, mycoprotein and eggs.</p></li>\n<li><p>That study you linked seems to deem a factor of healthiness of PB-ABAs as &quot;low in saturated fats&quot; without looking into what is there instead of the saturated fats and if the assumption that saturated fats are bad is even true to begin with. it also mentions PBAs being high in iron but makes no mention of how readily available that iron is to uptake for the human body. Haem iron is multiple times easier for the body to uptake than non-haem iron. (not that iron alone is enough to edge meats ahead or anything. my point here is simply to criticise some assumptions or oversights made in the study.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, one of the referenced studies in this lit review (Van Vliet et al. (2021)) concludes the following: &quot;The authors do not argue that one is healthier than the other, but that they have different (and perhaps complementary) metabolomic profiles.&quot; Which is entirely my point here. I think diversity is better than absolutes.</p></li>\n<li><p>This is neither here or there, but I was please to see it.

Hypothetically, half the above numbers would still be an absolute disaster, and without people going vegan en masse, in reality we are nowhere near reaching those numbers.\n\nAgain, as above it would be great to see more regulation against factory farming. Animal product prices go up, market moves to more PBAs and the remaining animal agriculture is better for animals and the environment. Eventually those who don't like PBAs might try them if the cost favored them and they might realise that they're actually alright mixed in with a diet which still has meat to satisfy their desires too. it's far from an ideal situation no matter how you look at solving it though and that's where there's undoubtedly an environmental benefit to going vege/vegan in the current form of agriculture.\n\n>I understand your point but many bold claims are correct. How much animal abuse, littering or shoplifting do you do in your personal life? Do you think a more balanced approach with a little bit of animal abuse, littering and shoplifting would be healthier?

If this was part of an environmental policy it would be ridiculed. Often this \u2018cutting down\u2019 claim seems to be nothing more than virtue signalling.

But I'll pick littering to prove my point here. I see no justification whatsoever for littering on non-biodegradable rubbish. However, littering isn't inherently bad. Let's say I chuck an apple core on the side of the road. If I eat an apple a day, keeping those apples out of the bin reduces maybe 5-10Kgs or waste being taken to a dump using fossil fuels only for it to decompose anaerobically to produce methane rather than carbon dioxide which it would break down to on the side of the road. I know I don't need to explain to you why that's a worse outcome. So sometimes a balanced approach is appropriate. As I have laid out, I don't think low intensity animal farming on grassland which suits it like here in NZ is bad even if the carbon footprint is bigger, it offers other benefits if done right and the emissions can be greatly reduced. However, some things are objectively bad as you also said. So some hard boundaries are good. I'd love to see us do away with factory farming of chickens. But also, poultry litter/guano is literally one of the best fertilisers in existence. High phosphorus which can't be sourced from many places at all without mining it and it's very biologically active which is key to nutrient conversion in the soil to make it plant available. This is why I don't eat anything other than free range eggs and on the rare occasion free range chicken. There's something I can actually attest to which isn't arbitrary. The issue here is we disagree on what is objectively bad and what is ok in some cases. And that's fine. I might find after a career in researching this stuff I was wrong all along.\n\nBeing a healthy vegan is no harder than being a healthy omnivore, which most people aren't. The fact that veganism at all ages can be entirely healthy is agreed by most major healthcare systems.\n\nTo be fair, it is getting easier and easier to be healthy on these diets which is great. However, on a very low data quality anecdotal basis, I don't know any vegetarian or vegans with any notable muscle on them. They're all skinny. And there is evidence to show that vegetarian proteins lack in amino acid diversity meaning you need to eat more veggie protein to get what you need (though that reference above about mycoproteins could prove that to help alleviate this issue. Anyway, sure, being skinny is 100% better than being obese and probably leads to more longevity than someone like me but it makes me wonder what would happen if I took up such a diet without meticulously planning what I eat. As someone in the higher end of the healthy BMI range but low fat and relatively high muscle I wonder how my body would cope. Maybe I could do an experiment and find out if I move in with my GF next year. She's good with veggie recipes. Me not so much. Nothing fixes post-workout cravings better than meat or milk and I'm yet to find a vegan food which can do this.
