Every execution client I tried just didn't work for whatever reason. So I tried someresat's [Ubuntu/Goerli/Lighthouse](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-ubuntu-g%C3%B6erli-lighthouse-8d0a2a811e6e) guide. Note: at this point I'm not sure if maybe something did work with that coincashew guide and I trigged issues that way...\n\nBut anyway, the guide was going fair enough. I did have to reset the \"swap\" row of the \"free -h\"(?) Which I did seem to be able to do and get it to 5GB. I installed Geth without problem, but when I did the status check it was just the white dot not the active green dot. So I rebooted and ran the start Geth again so it was green now.

I woke up to it logged out to my pin screen and the status was white again. After turning it on again it just was giving errors and I thought I should just start over fresh... which resulted in my not being able to re-install ubuntu about 7 different tries with my usb stick as I stared at the wall drenched in imposter syndrome. Made a new USB stick with the latest LTS version and 2 errors and some 'third times the charm' it seems to be back to square 1. \n\nMaybe it's just my own confirmation biases, but the biggest thing I run into is there doesn't seem to be a good explanation of what the \"sudo journalctl -fu geth\" should really be showing. Like there is a picutre, but mine never looks like that... and once you deviate from the guide you are kind of screwed. \n\nI will add, I did try using someresat's guide a while back (I think even once before this was updated in Aug) and from what I remember it has improved a lot. I do appreciate his guide seems to go into more detail of what each line is doing\n\nI'm going to give it a try again tonight and I'll let you know if (heh, try when) I get stuck again.

Geth just says &quot;snapshot extenstion registration failed &quot;peer connect on snap without compatible eth support&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>I rebooted by holding the physical power button, and now it&#39;s trying to sync again I guess. but all i get is everything basically saying lighthouse is failing with the yellow exit-code, geth is saying fix the beacon client, and the lighthousevalidator says error. </p>\n\n<p>So idk if that is even what your asking about, but that&#39;s the issue. It&#39;s like every time I try to follow these guides nothing connects, or syncs and it isn&#39;t really explained what to do.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-29 20:57:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"je8euc3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_125dn51","parent_id":"t1_je6amk8","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"I'd definitely suggest taking this to ethstaker to figure out what's wrong and then reaching out to coincashew and someresat to improve their guides so others don't run into the same issue","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;d definitely suggest taking this to ethstaker to figure out what&#39;s wrong and then reaching out to coincashew and someresat to improve their guides so others don&#39;t run into the same issue</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-29 23:13:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"je8r4bk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_125dn51","parent_id":"t1_je8euc3","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"I'll try, I feel like I'm just cursed now.

I had heard it's one of the easier solutions, so to see it is giving you trouble is unfortunate. However, I bring up my update as what I found out was my problem was hardware related. So now after a week or so of goofing around I'm somehow even further back... That said, that may be something you want to check out. It didn't really occur to me because my stuff was so new, but even new stuff is sold broken (or breaks quickly). \n\nJust a thought, as I'd hate to see you spin your wheels on something (hint: [like me spending 3 days with someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/126ossz/syncing_error_codes_help/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on r/ethstaker) to find out it's just hardware side.

As I probably was getting blinded with frustration so much that I would have not ever tested the Hardware - as dumb as that sounds in hindsight I guess. Based on your experience, I'm wondering if its a same issue. It seems odd to have so many problems using multiple methods. Food for thought.\n\nSomeresat's guides are supposed to be good. I was trying to use them but had difficulty, which now I'm not sure how much was my hardware. But I think even with the guide it can be confusing given the all the lines of texts and where you have to point files and stuff. The thread I linked actually was working fairly smoothly (again, outside the hardware issue) with the guide that person gave me. Maybe try that as well? I'll admit obviously I didn't succeed, but the whole conversation got me more comfortable. \n\nI guess all that block of text is to say don't be afraid to ask others for help. I wish I did earlier. I personally think it's the one major downfall of these guides (the assumption copy + paste will just 'work', with no real help if something deviates), and the solution isn't idea but people are really nice. \n\nAs for the second half, best advice I can say is this. I think your feelings are normal, I know I had/have them and I'm sure others did as well on their staking journey. But, even though it's normal, I wouldn't let those decisions happen in the moment. Obviously take a step back before any crazy action! \n\nYour point resonates with me though, as we may be in the same boat more then we initially thought. As me retiring (well, probably more like reasonably reducing my workload) would probably take something like ETH & my alt bags 10xing from here. So it's a tough situation, cuz as you said how much can someone really hold onto the though that crypto will just keep 10xing every other year, has the boat passed? When should we cut losses and stop risking the pleasant surprise double for the grand slam? I also think there are good arguments for just buying something like rETH and getting the easy 4% that way. No real shame in that tbh.\n\nWhere we probably differ a little is I sort of went through that the a few years ago with the house. I actually sold a lot of my ETH in 2021 as at the time I was teetering that line of wishful thinking and not really having made a meaningful dent in my life situation. It was tough at first, but I don't regret it. I'll probably be 'wrong' in a pure numbers sense, but I was able to complete a few goals of mine (hobby purchase, some fun money, got a nice bump to my retirement account) and got into my forever home at that time. reduce stress as well... so it was worth it. There is that blanket now of \"even if this goes to zero, it made a material difference in my life\". I KNOW I have a good house and I KNOW I will always have something to retire on. \n\nI guess that's all to say this... I think if you are an EVM and post in r/ethfinance and are trying to stake you must have some type of inner passion for the space. So I'd be hesitant to throw it away out of frustration, or focusing on a feeling that the roi isn't there. Maybe we differ here - but its been a longtime goal of mine to stake and I don't really think about it from a financial standpoint as much as completing a life goal with a finanical benefit. I'd think some of that is in you too for the above reasons. So I wouldn't give up too quickly. However, I also think if you decide you'd rather just sell a decent chunk to secure a house and let the rest ride (or maybe a RPL minipool?) I don't think you'll regret it either. Even just owning a home w/ minimal debt puts you so far ahead of life now-a-days, (sadly) 6 years as you alluded to is a good run and if you made a profit it's something to be proud of\n\nAnd I did read the whole thing!

No real shame in that tbh.</p>\n\n<p>Where we probably differ a little is I sort of went through that the a few years ago with the house. I actually sold a lot of my ETH in 2021 as at the time I was teetering that line of wishful thinking and not really having made a meaningful dent in my life situation. It was tough at first, but I don&#39;t regret it. I&#39;ll probably be &#39;wrong&#39; in a pure numbers sense, but I was able to complete a few goals of mine (hobby purchase, some fun money, got a nice bump to my retirement account) and got into my forever home at that time. reduce stress as well... so it was worth it. There is that blanket now of &quot;even if this goes to zero, it made a material difference in my life&quot;. I KNOW I have a good house and I KNOW I will always have something to retire on. </p>\n\n<p>I guess that&#39;s all to say this... I think if you are an EVM and post in <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a> and are trying to stake you must have some type of inner passion for the space. So I&#39;d be hesitant to throw it away out of frustration, or focusing on a feeling that the roi isn&#39;t there. Maybe we differ here - but its been a longtime goal of mine to stake and I don&#39;t really think about it from a financial standpoint as much as completing a life goal with a finanical benefit. I&#39;d think some of that is in you too for the above reasons. So I wouldn&#39;t give up too quickly. However, I also think if you decide you&#39;d rather just sell a decent chunk to secure a house and let the rest ride (or maybe a RPL minipool?) I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll regret it either. Even just owning a home w/ minimal debt puts you so far ahead of life now-a-days, (sadly) 6 years as you alluded to is a good run and if you made a profit it&#39;s something to be proud of</p>\n\n<p>And I did read the whole thing! Thanks for luck on ARB, and right back at you with some good vibes and luck to you on your staking journey! HMU if you ever need to vent haha.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-03 12:34:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jetpp7t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_125dn51","parent_id":"t1_jesjecm","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/-lightfoot","body":"Thanks very much for your reply!

I've been following their project for a while, the ideas are interesting. If it works, it's actually quite a large step forward in terms of PBS design. They claim relays cannot see the contents of blocks, there's a MEV smoothing pool built in, and (like the optimistic submissions being deployed by the [ultra sound relay](https://github.com/michaelneuder/optimistic-relay-documentation/blob/main/proposal.md) and elsewhere) relays don't have to perform validation before sending a block on.

All in all it's potentially (remains to be seen) an improvement over the current system\n\nI don't find their documentation to be very complete (or even accurate?), and their recently-published [GitHub repos](https://github.com/pon-pbs) contains [a fork of mev-boost-relay](https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-relay) without attribution to Flashbots or a proper commit history. And the actual meat of the system, centered around Restrictive Partially Blind Signatures, is [closed source](https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-reporter) and undocumented so far. It's also concerning that their [proposer guide](https://docs.ponrelay.com/pon/pguide) has you input your keystore.json and enter your password (?!). They've confirmed to me that it's only used locally (not uploaded) to prove that you control the validators you're registering, but this is not the way to do it.\n\nIt's something to keep an eye on if you're following the cutting edge of MEV and block production stuff, or if you have goerli validators and want something to test.

All in all it&#39;s potentially (remains to be seen) an improvement over the current system</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t find their documentation to be very complete (or even accurate?), and their recently-published <a href=\"https://github.com/pon-pbs\">GitHub repos</a> contains <a href=\"https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-relay\">a fork of mev-boost-relay</a> without attribution to Flashbots or a proper commit history. And the actual meat of the system, centered around Restrictive Partially Blind Signatures, is <a href=\"https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-reporter\">closed source</a> and undocumented so far. It&#39;s also concerning that their <a href=\"https://docs.ponrelay.com/pon/pguide\">proposer guide</a> has you input your keystore.json and enter your password (?!). They&#39;ve confirmed to me that it&#39;s only used locally (not uploaded) to prove that you control the validators you&#39;re registering, but this is not the way to do it.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s something to keep an eye on if you&#39;re following the cutting edge of MEV and block production stuff, or if you have goerli validators and want something to test. Otherwise maybe hold out for more info.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Side note: <a href=\"https://collective.flashbots.net/t/mev-boost-community-call-2-30-mar-2023/1465\">MEV-Boost Community Call 2</a> tomorrow at 16:00 UTC.
