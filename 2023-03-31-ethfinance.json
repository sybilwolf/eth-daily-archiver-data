Each account is a web3 wallet for users to trade and comment on other trades. Our market fit would start with the Bankless community and college students ([SPAWN](https://www.spawn.global/)).However, my long-term vision for the BA app: We allow users to import their data from other social media networks to their web3 wallet and build smart contracts that pool users data to connect ad buyers to users.\n\n***I believe that this project has the potential to do good for the world, and the way we value our data, but I need a passionate dev team to bring this thing to life.

Each account is a web3 wallet for users to trade and comment on other trades. Our market fit would start with the Bankless community and college students (<a href=\"https://www.spawn.global/\">SPAWN</a>).However, my long-term vision for the BA app: We allow users to import their data from other social media networks to their web3 wallet and build smart contracts that pool users data to connect ad buyers to users.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>I believe that this project has the potential to do good for the world, and the way we value our data, but I need a passionate dev team to bring this thing to life.

I don't understand your idea very well from the short description here but I will say Solidity devs are in pretty high demand and you're going to need a much better pitch to have a good shot at attracting some. To give you an idea what you're in for, here's how you bootstrap your average web3 project that requires more than 1 dev who isn't the founder and is willing to own all the development themselves.\n\nStart with someone good at marketing and be prepared to pay them a few grand to help you make this presentable. I still don't fully understand it after a re-read and I'm reasonably well-versed in this ecosystem. One of the EVM roles is this if you want to look up people in the community with this skillset.\n\nAfter that you need to nail down some business specifics like if there is going to be a DAO, if you're going to have a separate incorporated entity, where that will reside, etc. We had to go through all of this for Hodlercon last year. It's a bigger pile of work than it seems like up front.\n\nNext you're going to need an architect or solidity dev to help write a whitepaper or project docs. You can look at things like Tokemak or Alchemix for examples. Basically you need to be able to convey with precision what the Solidity devs will do. I recently wrote a whitepaper for an EthDenver project and got a DAO to greenlight funding it in advance. This usually only takes a few days but it can be daunting if it isn't your primary skillset.\n\nThen you go onto fundraising. At this point you still may not have written a line of code. You're going to want an intro to 2-3 VCs like Variant, Coinfund, Bloccelerate, etc. Each of these hosts in-person events or you can have someone in their network vouch for you and make an intro. You'll be sitting in a shark tank style room while they grill you about everything you just prepared above. What is the magnitude of the market opportunity? Where is the profitability for them? What is the schedule for expected returns? What is the corporate relationship with the DAO? What jurisdiction is it in? What is the marketing and outreach plan? What resources do you need from the VC other than funds?\n\nIf they like your initial pitch the VC will probably pair you with someone like me who can review the tokenomics of your product. We'll be looking at incentive alignment in your system design. Expect a rather ruthless dissection of something you love at this point. This is their no-bullshit fact checker that stops them from wasting money on inherently flawed designs.\n\nIf that all passes you now have funding secured. Next you want to engage with an auditor. There are different plans for different levels of engagement but I recommend you audit the code as you go. They are your partners, not a checkbox to seek after the project is done.\n\nDoing all of this will probably take you half a year. This is the level of preparedness your average Solidity dev is comparing you against when they are available for a project.

Some even go so far as saying these individuals are either directly or indirectly falling for disinformation campaigns of foreign bad-actors. However, this perspective overlooks several key points, which are detailed below.\r  \n\r\n\n1. Identifying vs. Creating Flaws: It is important to differentiate between pointing out existing flaws in the monetary system and actually creating them. Critics must recognize that those who highlight these issues are not responsible for their existence. Instead, they are attempting to bring attention to problems that have the potential to destabilize the global economy and challenge the USD's dominance.\r  \n\r\n2. Encouraging Transparency and Accountability: By discussing the weaknesses of the United States' post-WWII monetary policy, these individuals are fostering an environment of transparency and accountability. This is crucial for a healthy and robust financial system, as it allows for the identification of potential pitfalls, encourages informed decision-making, and ultimately strengthens the overall system.\r  \n\r\n3. Supporting Adaptation and Improvement: Identifying the flaws in the current monetary policy can serve as a catalyst for necessary changes, ensuring the continued strength and stability of the USD. Ignoring these issues and dismissing their potential impact could instead lead to a more significant decline in the currency's value and the erosion of American interests.\r  \n\r\n4. Protecting American Interests: The primary goal of those pointing out the flaws in the USA government's monetary policy is to safeguard American interests. By shedding light on the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the system, they aim to generate public and political support for necessary reforms, thus helping to maintain the USD's global standing and preserve the nation's economic well-being.\r  \n\r\n5. Fostering Global Economic Stability: The dominance of the USD in the global economy is a responsibility that requires constant vigilance and a willingness to address potential threats. By pointing out the flaws in the post-WWII monetary policy, individuals are contributing to a broader conversation about how to preserve and enhance the stability of the global economic system. This ultimately benefits not only the United States but also the international community.\r\n\nIn conclusion, the majority of those who discuss the flaws in the USD's post-WWII monetary policy are not undermining the currency's value or American interests. Instead, they are striving to ensure the ongoing stability and dominance of American interests by encouraging transparency, accountability, and adaptation. Stubbornly adhering to a policy of sticking your head in the sand and ignoring the root of the problems introduced over the past 100 years which lead us to where we are today, then decrying anyone pointing out those issues as enemies of the state is utterly asinine.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Critics of cryptocurrency advocates who point out the flaws introduced in the monetary system by FDR&#39;s FIAT monetary policy adopted by the United States in the 1930&#39;s often argue that such discussions risk devaluing the currency or harming American interests.

Roe was having technical difficulties, but Young Jared came to the rescue and connected with SBF on a Ventrilo server. What, at first, appeared to be audio issues was ultimately pinpointed to the background noise of furious clicking and keyboard mashing.

SBF delivered a silver-tongued speech on the effective altruism movement, which quickly put Roe\u2019s finely honed interviewing prowess in a relaxed state. He became more enamoured with SBF by the second, clinging to every word as if SBF had put him under a spell. It was all smiles and laughter, as they made light-hearted banter about SBF\u2019s series of incompetencies that led to the ultimate demise of FTX. At one point Roe even referred to it as the big \u201c*Oops!*\u201d moment in crypto, as they went on to explore the lessons learned from the failure.\r  \n\r  \nAs per usual, the conversation turned to martial arts. SBF revealed that he had a black belt in Wing Chi. Roe said his bullshit detector is usually on point, but he just couldn\u2019t tell anymore. Roe had SBF get up out of his chair midway through the interview to do this spinning side kick he had learned in Nantucket. SBF did an awkward 360 maneuver while raising his leg half-way as if he had to pee like a dog. Roe was enthralled and asked SBF if he could show him how to perform the Triangle of Death sometime.\r  \n\r  \nThe next day Hogan immediately followed up his subsequent podcast with investigative Youtube journalist, CoffeeKong, as his guest. CoffeeKong was infuriated that Roe had let SBF off the hook so easy and really let him have it. Coffee said Roe let his listeners down by not grilling SBF with the hard hitting questions. Through his investigate work, Coffee had gathered the details of the FTX saga that the media had conveniently left out of their reporting. What Coffee revealed to Roe next was shocking. He went into grim detail about SBF\u2019s wild, cocaine fueled orgies on the rooftop of his penthouse with - *get this* \\- life-sized Tamagotchi pets\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s right. CoffeeKong proceeded to take Roe on a dark ride into the twisted, disturbing past of SBF\u2019s obsession with Tamagotchi toys. What began as an innocent fascination with digital monster battles contained within cute egg-shaped devices led, over time, to the acquiring of peculiar tastes\u2026 Deviant tastes which continued to escalate until one day, SBF demanded his betrothed Caroline get dressed up as a Tamagotchi pet. It all spiraled out of control from there. \r  \n\r  \nTaking a few moments to absorb the shock of these revelations, with beads of sweat pouring down his bald head, Hogan was absolutely floored. He just couldn\u2019t believe he had let SBF pull the wool over his eyes. FTX hadn\u2019t simply collapsed out of sheer incompetency as Hogan was led to believe\u2026 SBF had mindlessly commingled customers\u2019 personal investment funds while coked to the gills, all amidst a revolving door of furries!

CoffeeKong was infuriated that Roe had let SBF off the hook so easy and really let him have it. Coffee said Roe let his listeners down by not grilling SBF with the hard hitting questions. Through his investigate work, Coffee had gathered the details of the FTX saga that the media had conveniently left out of their reporting. What Coffee revealed to Roe next was shocking. He went into grim detail about SBF\u2019s wild, cocaine fueled orgies on the rooftop of his penthouse with - <em>get this</em> - life-sized Tamagotchi pets\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s right. CoffeeKong proceeded to take Roe on a dark ride into the twisted, disturbing past of SBF\u2019s obsession with Tamagotchi toys. What began as an innocent fascination with digital monster battles contained within cute egg-shaped devices led, over time, to the acquiring of peculiar tastes\u2026 Deviant tastes which continued to escalate until one day, SBF demanded his betrothed Caroline get dressed up as a Tamagotchi pet. It all spiraled out of control from there. </p>\n\n<p>Taking a few moments to absorb the shock of these revelations, with beads of sweat pouring down his bald head, Hogan was absolutely floored. He just couldn\u2019t believe he had let SBF pull the wool over his eyes. FTX hadn\u2019t simply collapsed out of sheer incompetency as Hogan was led to believe\u2026 SBF had mindlessly commingled customers\u2019 personal investment funds while coked to the gills, all amidst a revolving door of furries! Hogan vowed to get SBF back on the podcast to hold him accountable for his actions.</p>\n\n<p>I just knew something was amiss this whole time. You know, the more I hear about this SBF guy, the less I care for the fella\u2026</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-31 08:18:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jef15bo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_127app5","parent_id":"t3_127app5","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ajmonkfish","body":"Sir, this is a Wendy's.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sir, this is a Wendy&#39;s.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-31 08:24:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jef23si","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_127app5","parent_id":"t1_jef15bo","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"Mam, this is a Rendy's","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Mam, this is a Rendy&#39;s</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-31 08:28:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jef2roj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_127app5","parent_id":"t1_jef23si","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Careless_Bug_7951","body":"Is this a copypasta?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is this a copypasta?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-31 09:21:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jefaz22","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_127app5","parent_id":"t1_jef15bo","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Vandelay101","body":"Just the last sentence, which originated from Norm Macdonald.
