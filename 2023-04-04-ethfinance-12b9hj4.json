I went through this crap in the (late) 90s :)\n\nFor ssh, you're doing the right thing. If you're running firewalls on individual machines, that will make life a little more complicated. Certainly your chosen sshd port (i.e. ssh server port) on the validator will need to be open.

Typically just ssh into the new port. You can run: > netstat -tlpn  to see what services are listening on your validator. Look out for sshd on <your_new_port> rather than 22. For external access from the Internet, when you change the port on your validator box, you'll need to \"Port Forward\" in the router from some external port value (whatever you like) to the new port value on your box (should be fairly straightforward). So when you ssh in from an Internet machine, you'll use the port you forwarded on the firewall / router, NOT the value on the validator box itself. (The firewall will take care of that mapping.) Also, ensure you restart the sshd process after changing the port value.\n\nHTH!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>As I\u2019m sure you known it is very demoralising when this unexpected shit seems to happen on almost every apparently easy line of a guide with no mention of why or what to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Absolutely.

While I don&#39;t like the PnD, I think it definitely is quite a big deal for the memes and the movement at the moment but I hope it becomes a non-even as the memes grow, similar to how things were with crypto when it was easily PnDed in earlier years. And I&#39;m just curious to see how 6529 keeps building out the ecosystem and it would be interesting to look back on this in a year or two. And definitely in 5-8 years as the message so far has been about building out the metaverse, their meaning is more of digital world not just a literal digital world like oncyber or decentraland, and it was about the long-term view not the short term.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-04 18:38:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jezx6kf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12b9hj4","parent_id":"t3_12b9hj4","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-04 05:37:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jewsm4q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12b9hj4","parent_id":"t3_12b9hj4","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/bennyGbennyG","body":"i think uphold is one of the few places, and while they are technically legit, prepare for terrible customer service, a strange UI and possible KYC complications or random account suspension","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>i think uphold is one of the few places, and while they are technically legit, prepare for terrible customer service, a strange UI and possible KYC complications or random account suspension</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-04 05:42:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jewt51w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12b9hj4","parent_id":"t1_jewsm4q","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/cryptomoon2020","body":"Kraken","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Kraken</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-04 09:15:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jexmxgh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12b9hj4","parent_id":"t1_jewsm4q","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/dabadger0","body":"Can probable do it on Coinbase, I have XRP and ETH in my Coinbase account and have moved on and off chain previously with both XRP and ETH.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Can probable do it on Coinbase, I have XRP and ETH in my Coinbase account and have moved on and off chain previously with both XRP and ETH.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-04 06:15:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jewx2ey","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12b9hj4","parent_id":"t1_jewsm4q","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/MrDeltaLLB","body":"Looking at putting together a triptych from the LOVE Tennis Art Project.
