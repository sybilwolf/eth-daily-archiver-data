I've heard an argument for banning was that the app can be a gateway for bad actors into controlling your device, does this make any sense?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey crypto(graphy) experts I need your input. In my country a lot of jobs in government have banned the use of tiktok and telegram. Most agree that banning tiktok makes sense, but there&#39;s been some discussion on whether it makes any sense to ban telegram. Some argue its just a lazy ban because the founder is Russian, and that it doesn&#39;t make any sense from a technological standpoint. I realize telegram security isn&#39;t at the level of signal, but is it any worse than, say, messenger, twitter, which is not banned? I&#39;ve heard an argument for banning was that the app can be a gateway for bad actors into controlling your device, does this make any sense?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-07 00:00:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfag5ik","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12eagbz","parent_id":"t3_12eagbz","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-07 00:11:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfagysc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12eagbz","parent_id":"t1_jfag5ik","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/18boro","body":"That's my first impression as well, seems a bit strange since Durov left Russia long time ago, but I don't know the details on how/where telegram is run from.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s my first impression as well, seems a bit strange since Durov left Russia long time ago, but I don&#39;t know the details on how/where telegram is run from.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-07 00:29:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfaiaha","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12eagbz","parent_id":"t1_jfagysc","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-07 00:15:44","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-05-05 04:34:49","id":"jfah91q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12eagbz","parent_id":"t1_jfag5ik","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/OMG_WTF_ATH","body":"Doesn\u2019t China always ban US Companies like Google, Wikipedia, etc.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Doesn\u2019t China always ban US Companies like Google, Wikipedia, etc.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-07 03:00:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfasrxr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12eagbz","parent_id":"t1_jfah91q","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/defewit","body":"No. Tons of US companies operate in China to the tune of billions of dollars in revenue.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>No. Tons of US companies operate in China to the tune of billions of dollars in revenue.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-07 04:16:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfaylzz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12eagbz","parent_id":"t1_jfasrxr","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/monkeyhold99","body":"Europe is not stupid for following, and it doesn\u2019t require much critical thinking to know that banning TikTok makes perfect sense for them. \n\nChina is an enemy of the west, so why wouldn\u2019t they also ban it?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Europe is not stupid for following, and it doesn\u2019t require much critical thinking to know that banning TikTok makes perfect sense for them. </p>\n\n<p>China is an enemy of the west, so why wouldn\u2019t they also ban it?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-07 01:36:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfan11f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12eagbz","parent_id":"t1_jfah91q","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Yeopaa","body":"Italy just banned Chat GPT4.

Layer 2 rollups are a scaling solution that allows computation to take place off-chain while maintaining the security of the Ethereum main chain. Rollups have gained popularity as a means to reduce network congestion and lower transaction fees.\n\n* The central concept introduced in EIP-4844 is the implementation of shard blob transactions, which involve the transfer of data into small pieces known as \"blobs.\" This implementation aims to optimize the Data Availability problem of rollups and reduce the gas costs associated with call data, a component of Ethereum transactions that contains input data to a smart contract. The introduction of shard blob transactions is part of a larger effort to lay the groundwork for Ethereum's future sharding process, in which the blockchain will be divided into smaller, interconnected chains called shards.\n\n* The Merge, another important event in Ethereum's roadmap, refers to the transition of Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition, which is part of Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, is expected to significantly reduce new Ether issuance and energy consumption.\n\n* According to Cam Crossley, an analyst at web3 venture studio NotCentralised, Layer 2 gas usage is expected to increase until EIP-4844 goes live, which will occur roughly one year after The Merge. The implementation of EIP-4844 is anticipated to significantly reduce the gas consumption of Layer 2 rollups. As a result, Layer 2 solutions such as Optimistic Rollups and ZK-Rollups are expected to see transaction fees reduced by factors ranging from 3-8 times to 40-100 times, respectively, compared to Ethereum's Layer 1. This reduction in gas consumption is expected to provide substantial benefits to users, developers, and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole by making transactions more efficient and cost-effective.\n\n* The impact of EIP-4844 on Ethereum's overall burn rate is, however, uncertain. It's important to note that Ethereum's burn rate is primarily influenced by EIP-1559, an upgrade implemented in August 2021 as part of the London hard fork. EIP-1559 introduced a base fee that is burned for each transaction, making Ethereum's monetary policy more predictable and deflationary. The burn rate refers to the rate at which Ether is destroyed, and it can be influenced by various factors, including network congestion, transaction volume, and gas fees.\n\n* Crossley stated, \"Beyond [EIP-4844] it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess,\" suggesting that while EIP-4844 will have a positive impact on reducing gas consumption for rollups, it is unclear how it will influence the overall deflationary dynamics of Ethereum. He further hypothesized that Ethereum Layer 1 might continue to retain the majority of high-value DeFi (Decentralized Finance) transactions due to higher security and the ability to facilitate value transfer between different Layer 2 solutions.\n\n* While EIP-4844 is not specifically aimed at altering Ethereum's burn rate, it is part of a series of ongoing upgrades and proposals designed to improve the scalability, efficiency, and sustainability of the Ethereum network. As Ethereum continues to evolve with upgrades such as The Merge and future sharding implementations, the dynamics of gas fees, issuance, and burn rate are expected to change, potentially leading to a more scalable and sustainable network.\n\n* In summary, EIP-4844 is a significant upgrade that aims to reduce gas consumption for Layer 2 rollups, enhance scalability, and lay the foundation for Ethereum's future sharding process. The impact of this upgrade on Ethereum's overall burn rate is uncertain, and the deflationary dynamics of Ethereum will continue to be influenced by various factors, including other Ethereum Improvement Proposals, network activity, and future upgrades as part of Ethereum 2.0.
