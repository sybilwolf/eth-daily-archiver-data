The MEV bot hack wasn't anything like the previous hacks, and gave me somewhat of a pause.

There was even a consensus call where one of the core devs specifically proclaimed that this wasn't an issue with MEV boost or the general Ethereum ecosystem.

So if they choose a different ordering that gives them more value than the slashing penalty (1 ETH), they can try to immediately publish it (double sign), and hope the new block makes it into the canonical blockchain.\n\nThe problem isn't just MEV, but MEV from the MEV extraction itself (MEV squared?). This apparently is millions of dollars because of greedy sandwiching bots (as we saw in the hack). With this much at stake, I don't think this is the end of similar attempts. Validators may try it even if they have just a 1% chance of succeeding (especially after withdrawals are enabled).\n\nHow does this not become an arms race between the relayers and the validators? The relayers will try to withhold the block from the validator that signs it (they already implemented a delay). In response to this, the validator will try to penetrate the network with many well-connected nodes in order to listen for the broadcast, and then use the same nodes to broadcast the reordered block as quickly as possible. The relayers will then also try to penetrate the network, to increase their advantage, but can they really push it over 99%?\n\nThe relayers can also patch MEV boost clients to prefer only boosted blocks (with unknown consequences to the network). Or they can form private MEV networks with known validators for riskier MEV strategies.

Any subsequent arguments are treated as the arguments passed to the function.In the context of an object constructor, you might use .call() to invoke a parent constructor from a child constructor, while setting the this value of the parent constructor to the child instance. Here's an example:*\n\n    function Person(name) { this.name = name; }\n     function Employee(name, title) { Person.call(this, name); this.title = title; }\n    const employee = new Employee('Alice', 'Manager'); console.log(employee.name); // Output: \"Alice\" console.log(employee.title); // Output: \"Manager\"\n\n*In this example, Employee is a child constructor of Person. When we create a new Employee instance with new Employee('Alice', 'Manager'), we want to invoke the parent constructor (Person) and set the this value of the Person constructor to the Employee instance. We do this by calling Person.call(this, name) from within the Employee constructor, passing in the this value of the Employee instance as the first argument to .call().*\n\nQ: But Person is not a prototype of Employee right?\n\n*A: That's correct, Person is not a prototype of Employee. However, by using call() in the Employee constructor, you are effectively calling the Person constructor with the this keyword set to the newly created Employee object. This means that the Employee object will inherit the properties and methods of Person.In other words, Employee is not a subclass of Person, but it borrows functionality from Person through the use of call().*\n\nQ: So it's like a copy?\n\n*Yes, when a constructor function creates a new instance of an object, the new instance inherits properties and methods from the constructor's prototype. So, when you use Person.call(this, name, age) in the Employee constructor, you're calling the Person constructor function and passing in the current instance of Employee as the this value, which means that the new Employee instance will have the same properties as a Person instance.*\n\nQ: All of the same properties?\n\n*Yes, when you use .call() or .apply(), the this value inside the function will reference the object passed as the first argument, and the properties and methods of that object will be available inside the function.*\n\nQ: Including functions?\n\n*Yes, including functions.*\n\nQ: But not the function declared on the prototype right?\n\n*That's correct. When you use the call method to invoke a function in the context of a different object, the function has access to all properties and methods of that object, including any properties and methods that are inherited from its prototype chain. However, it does not have access to functions that are defined on the prototype chain of the original object.*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m using it to learn coding.
