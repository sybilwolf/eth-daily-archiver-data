I ended up explaining the basics of lending in crypto which I'm going to paraphrase here. This is probably one of those things everyone here already knows but which might be useful if you ever need to explain this to someone outside this space.\n\nThere are three ways we facilitate lending in crypto today:\n\n1) Overcollateralization. You post collateral worth more than what you're borrowing. In Tradfi this is basically the structure of every mortgage/car loan. You use the property you are buying as collateral for the mortgage itself. This works best for assets that are unlikely to sharply depreciate in value and put lenders underwater. In Defi, that property obviously doesn't hold so we add self-liquidating mechanisms to this system. If your collateral ever falls in value relative to your loan you forfeit the collateral to repay the debt automatically. We mostly use these loans for financial speculation or retaining price exposure to an asset while effectively selling some of it. \n\n2) Flash Loans. We let you borrow as much money as you want on the condition that you have to repay it instantly. I find this is the most confusing one to people at face value but it makes sense to most people when explained in terms of originating mortgages. Again, mortgages are overcollateralized loans. Without flashloans there is a bit of a chicken and egg problem where without the loan you can't buy the property and without the property you can't get the loan. In Tradfi they have an intermediary facilitate this by effectively granting you a short term loan. In Defi, that's just involving an unnecessary middleman so we dispense with it.\n\n3) Leverage. You can use 1 ETH to buy 3 ETH and exaggerated effects as the price goes up and down. This is similar to overcollateralized lending except we don't actually *give you* the 3 ETH. It's held in escrow by some contract so you can't run away with it. In the example above if your collateral falls by 1/3 in value you get margin called and liquidated. This is really no different than how it works on traditional brokerages. The main difference with Defi is while things like naked shorting are *illegal* in Tradfi brokerages, they are *impossible* in Defi.\n\nThat leads us to the last form of debt most people know: uncollateralized lending based on credit. While there are some teams experimenting with this, we just can't bootstrap these systems effectively until we solve the problem of accountability. IRL it is both difficult and illegal to set up multiple identities. On blockchains it is trivial and there is no such thing as the police. If I am willing to give an anonymous stranger $10 on credit I at least need to know that if they rug me they can only do that *once*. That at least means I can only get rugged 7 billion times. Identity theft and fraud are already a problem in Tradfi. In Defi, the problem is so much worse that what you take for granted with a credit card today can't even get started. We may see a Tradfi equivalent to credit systems on a blockchain once a government decides to build a system to certify an identity on chain and integrate their legal system with smart contracts for enforcement but we'd really like to see a more decentralized approach.\n\nThere are numerous advantages to eventually solving this problem on the blockchain. For people with existing access to credit, a technology called zero knowledge proofs adds privacy protection so Experion doesn't repeatedly leak your personal data to identity thieves. Next, is consumer choice: the market would be free to create a much wider array of credit score services rather than the regulatory captured monopolies we have today. Last, ironically is scalability; not in transaction throughput but in customers. Right now credit services are available to a minority of people, mostly in first world countries. If this becomes solved in Defi in a decentralized way it can be scaled to all of humanity rather than the limited countries credit services exist in today. This is where a company like Visa will actively get involved eventually because it is a Trillion dollar opportunity that will let them expand their user base.\n\nThese systems won't take root in Defi until we have a good system for proving an address belongs to someone and that they singularly claim that address for these credit systems. Once we have that we'll see a variety of credit score DAOs appear in short order. They will essentially act like competing underwriters but unlike Tradfi the performance of each will be public and every app will be free to choose whose opinion they respect and pay for.\n\nI'm also still curious about [alternative credit systems](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/monetizing-honesty).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I was talking with some family friends today for Easter brunch and, being polite, they asked me about some crypto topics.

His feeling is that the ratio has to go down because that\u2019s what happened last bear cycle, but he\u2019s ignoring why eth struggled so much back then. The ICO failure, no real use cases, miners dumping eth to cover costs led to heavier than normal sell pressure imo. Now eth has viable use cases, nfts, defi, sign in with ethereum, successful network upgrades, less energy usage ,deflationary etc.</p>\n\n<p>His argument against this is that fundamentals don\u2019t matter during a bear market, but this doesn\u2019t really make sense to me. They may not matter as MUCH, but they have to account for some portion of pricing otherwise all assets would be all over the place price wise irrespective of what was behind them. I think if the ratio was going to dump or if eth was \u201cheading home\u201d it would have done so already. At this point he won\u2019t believe it until the next bull run is confirmed and eth is clearly at new all time highs. It\u2019s his strategy though and it could be right, I just personally don\u2019t think so.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-10 18:46:55","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-04-10 19:02:29","id":"jfrxeeo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12h7qgo","parent_id":"t1_jfrmac4","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/geliboy695000","body":"You mean ETH at all time highs AGAINST BTC?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You mean ETH at all time highs AGAINST BTC?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-10 19:49:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfs5e7j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12h7qgo","parent_id":"t1_jfrxeeo","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/perm37","body":"USD and ETH/BTC.
