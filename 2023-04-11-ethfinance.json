I got the node in sync and left it running for a few weeks and noticed it wasn't actually being used, there was 0 NANO delegated to me. I made a post somewhere on Reddit asking why, and the responses I got was that no one will delegate to me unless I make a public post and disclose my node specs, my internet speeds, my nano holdings, why I am running a node, how long I will run one for, how long I have been running one for, pledge my full allegiance to the god in the sky that is nano, and all of that.\n\nImagine if you had to do that with Ethereum. \"Hey guys, I want to join the network and validate, could I please receive permission from everyone so that I can be let in?\" If you want a blockchain network you need it to be trustless, it is one of the core philosophies.\n\nOtherwise you might as well go to Microsoft's website and pay for an Azure SQL Managed Instance. You'll also get more TPS that way too.\n\nAnyway when I mentioned how ridiculous all of that was, and that I am not going to advertise my own node especially when I was running it for *their* benefit since I didn't have any nano, I had two people from the nano community reply to me. One person said I was probably running my node on a garbage tier digital ocean server so it serves me right that no one would delegate to me. Then I made the counter point that was no one is going to spend money to buy hardware to run a node for NANO, they will just delegate to someone who already is running one. I then got a response from someone else, who said something along the lines of there is no need to buy hardware, you can host one on a $5 a month digital ocean server. \n\nRight.....\n\nThey were so incredibly hostile and overly rude the entire time too, definitely not a welcoming community. One user came along to \"call me out\" and accused me of never running a node in the first place, and then a community manager came along to defend their behaviour...\n\nAfter that interaction I formatted the machine and have held a very negative opinion of the community and the project.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>nano was ahead of its time, no cost transfer, fast as fk and do what a currency should do.

I got the node in sync and left it running for a few weeks and noticed it wasn&#39;t actually being used, there was 0 NANO delegated to me. I made a post somewhere on Reddit asking why, and the responses I got was that no one will delegate to me unless I make a public post and disclose my node specs, my internet speeds, my nano holdings, why I am running a node, how long I will run one for, how long I have been running one for, pledge my full allegiance to the god in the sky that is nano, and all of that.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if you had to do that with Ethereum. &quot;Hey guys, I want to join the network and validate, could I please receive permission from everyone so that I can be let in?&quot; If you want a blockchain network you need it to be trustless, it is one of the core philosophies.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise you might as well go to Microsoft&#39;s website and pay for an Azure SQL Managed Instance. You&#39;ll also get more TPS that way too.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway when I mentioned how ridiculous all of that was, and that I am not going to advertise my own node especially when I was running it for <em>their</em> benefit since I didn&#39;t have any nano, I had two people from the nano community reply to me. One person said I was probably running my node on a garbage tier digital ocean server so it serves me right that no one would delegate to me. Then I made the counter point that was no one is going to spend money to buy hardware to run a node for NANO, they will just delegate to someone who already is running one. I then got a response from someone else, who said something along the lines of there is no need to buy hardware, you can host one on a $5 a month digital ocean server. </p>\n\n<p>Right.....</p>\n\n<p>They were so incredibly hostile and overly rude the entire time too, definitely not a welcoming community. One user came along to &quot;call me out&quot; and accused me of never running a node in the first place, and then a community manager came along to defend their behaviour...</p>\n\n<p>After that interaction I formatted the machine and have held a very negative opinion of the community and the project.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-11 08:02:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfu2tm0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12i920r","parent_id":"t1_jftpmfp","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hiredgoon","body":">The network is run on 70 or so nodes.
