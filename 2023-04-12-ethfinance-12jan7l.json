Despite all the FUD about millions of ETH that is going to unlock itself and dump (I&#39;m not seeing it yet), practically speaking this is a huge reduction in execution risk for stakers.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-12 15:36:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jg0qezb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12jan7l","parent_id":"t3_12jan7l","score":46,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/NonceSenses","body":"The staking yield return is tied to the asset price in a loop so it has to find the balance first.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The staking yield return is tied to the asset price in a loop so it has to find the balance first.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-13 03:48:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jg2sxfj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12jan7l","parent_id":"t1_jg0qezb","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-12 00:36:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfxqykt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12jan7l","parent_id":"t3_12jan7l","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/bagogel12","body":"(I havent read the blog)\n\nHis fund maelstrom is invested in ether.fi and obol, two competitors to Lido.\n\nIs he just selling his books?\nOr is he putting his money where his mouth is?\n\nI don't know.

Let's review some of the key FUD talking points that have been laid to rest:\n\n* EIP-1559 FUD: EIP-1559 was a significant change to Ethereum's fee market, which aimed to improve transaction fee predictability and introduce a base fee that gets burned. Initially, there were concerns about miners protesting the change due to reduced revenue. However, Ethereum successfully implemented EIP-1559 in August 2021, and the network continued to function without any major disruptions.\n* Merge FUD: The Merge refers to the transition of Ethereum from its old Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS). There were concerns about potential security and stability issues during this transition. However, the Ethereum community worked diligently on the Merge, and after several testnets had been launched to ensure what ended up being an extremely smooth transition.\n* Scalability: Critics have argued that Ethereum's low transaction throughput would prevent it from becoming a global platform for decentralized applications. However, Ethereum's developers successfully deployed Layer 2 scaling solutions (such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync). Not to mention the up-coming proto-danksharding and the surge.\n* Competition: Ethereum has faced competition from other blockchain platforms like Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, and Polkadot, each claiming to offer better performance or functionality by sacrificing security, decentralization, or turing complete alternatives to the EVM. While competition exists, Ethereum has a strong ecosystem, network effect, and developer community that continues to drive its growth and innovation without sacrificing security or decentralization.\n* Smart contract security: Ethereum has had high-profile smart contract hacks and failures, such as the DAO hack in 2016 and various DeFi exploits. These incidents have led to concerns about the platform's security. However, the Ethereum community has learned from these events, and developers now emphasize security audits, formal verification, and insurance solutions to mitigate risks.\n* Environmental concerns: Ethereum's Proof of Work consensus mechanism was  criticized for its energy consumption and carbon footprint. However, Ethereum successfully transitioned to the more environmentally-friendly Proof of Stake consensus mechanism which dramatically reduced energy consumption.\n* Inflation FUD: Another concern that has been raised about Ethereum critics argue surrounds Ethereum's monetary policy. Simply because it did not have a hard cap on supply like bitcoin, misleading claims were made that this would result in a continuous increase in its supply, leading to inflation and potential devaluation of the cryptocurrency. The inclusion of EIP-1559 and the merge have completely changed the game, and now the Ethereum supply cap seeks an equilibrium which will likely result in more than 50% of the existing supply being burned over the next 200 years.\n\nThe most likely spring-board for the next round of FUD will likely come from the following:\n\n1. Centralization: Some argue that Ethereum's development is centralized around the Ethereum Foundation or that its network relies heavily on Infura, a centralized infrastructure provider. However, Ethereum is a decentralized platform with a diverse developer community, and alternative infrastructure providers are available. Every upgrade and hard-fork and EIP has had extremely strong consensus and support from the community as a whole. Should an EIP, hard fork, or upgrade be considered contentious, then it is likely the community will not allow it.\n2. Regulatory risks: Concerns about Ethereum being declared a security have been another source of FUD. Even since the early days of Ethereum, there has always been uncertainty about how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies will classify Ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies. In April 2018, the former SEC director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, stated that based on his understanding, Ether is not considered a security. This was because Ethereum's decentralized nature and the lack of a controlling organization or third party responsible for its success made it more akin to a commodity. However, recently Gary Gensler has recently stated everything except for bitcoin is a security.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Indeed, Ethereum has faced numerous FUD talking points throughout its development, and many of these concerns have been addressed or debunked over time.

Every upgrade and hard-fork and EIP has had extremely strong consensus and support from the community as a whole. Should an EIP, hard fork, or upgrade be considered contentious, then it is likely the community will not allow it.</li>\n<li>Regulatory risks: Concerns about Ethereum being declared a security have been another source of FUD. Even since the early days of Ethereum, there has always been uncertainty about how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies will classify Ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies. In April 2018, the former SEC director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, stated that based on his understanding, Ether is not considered a security. This was because Ethereum&#39;s decentralized nature and the lack of a controlling organization or third party responsible for its success made it more akin to a commodity. However, recently Gary Gensler has recently stated everything except for bitcoin is a security.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-12 14:03:29","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-04-12 14:13:37","id":"jg0cuu0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12jan7l","parent_id":"t1_jg08nxb","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheHighFlyer","body":"Regulatory FUD is mute because for markets uncertainty is always worse than regulatory clarity.

Then you need to input the Withdrawal Credential numbers (the ones starting 0x00...) in that same corresponding order, which is the next step from memory. This is the only way you can pass validation in Eth Cli or the process will always fail at validation. No need to dig into the depositdata file or anything like that. The biggest problem is that [Beaconcha.in](https://Beaconcha.in) does not list your validators in numerical order hence when you copy/paste stuff it's all in jumbled order. It's only when they're in perfect numerical order that Eth Cli is like 'oh yeah, these are your validators'. I am just writing this out in long obvious format as a kind of 'idiot proof guide to resolving this problem' as I assume other home stakers will google this and eventually find our posts.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Indeed.

But the store owner is quirky and has a rule that goes \"This store will only sell 1000 total items per day. Whether that's 1 apple and 999 oranges, or 900 apples and 100 oranges, or a perfect split I don't care. Once I sold my 1000th item I'm done for the day.\"\n\nAlso, this store's apples are very good. People drive from all over the place to buy them. So naturally since supply is low and demand is high, so the cost of apples go up and the store owner makes a killing selling them. Oranges, on the other hand, aren't as popular. On average, the store owner sells about 980 apples and 20 oranges every day.\n\nYou personally don't really care that much about the apples, you want to buy oranges. But due to the store's weird rule, you still have to outbid people looking to buy to buy apples. Oranges should be cheap because they are plentiful and in low demand, but every orange you buy is an apple someone else can't buy. After the store sold 999 items that day, why would he sell you an orange for $1 when someone's willing to buy an apple for $10? You'll have to offer at least $10 to get the orange you want.\n\n\"This is really dumb\", you think to yourself. You talk to the store owner and make him come to his senses, and he agrees to change his stupid rule. Now he'll sell at most 1000 apples per day *and* at most 100 oranges per day. So now that the two supply/demand markets are separated, an apple can cost $10 and the orange can cost $1 and everybody's happy - you get cheap oranges, and the store owner gets more money (1000 x $10 + 200 x $1 gets him more money than the previous system when $10 was the cost of an *item* and he sold 1000)\n\nBack in Ethereum land the apple represent *execution* (the gas that affects state, compute stuff in the EVM, etc.) and oranges represent *data* (the gas that stores stuff in the chain's history). Rollups do their execution off-chain, so what they need most from Layer 1 is data. Today the cheapest solution is using call data at 16 gas per byte. But if everyone's fighting to do EVM stuff, the cost of that 16 gas/bytes goes up as well because there's only so much gas in each block. This really shouldn't be the case, since data is a different resource from execution.\n\nSo what EIP4844 does is separate those two resources into two distinct markets: The gas market as we know it today stays the same, and there's a new \"data gas\" resource with its own pricing that happens separately. Rollups will be happy because now they get to commit their batches on chain in these nifty new things called \"blobs\", and when demand for blobs is low, blobs will be cheap \u00ad\u2014 even if there's a huge NFT drop going on that brings gas to 500 gwei\n\nOn a technical level it does other cool things in preparation for full danksharding later on, which will allow a significant increase in the size of blobs so that it becomes even cheaper for rollups to commit data to blobs.

Without getting into the technicals, the problem is \"data availability\" (not data storage - blobs expire!). A fully mature rollup needs strong guarantees that the data they send to L1 is available to download by anyone who wants it. 4844 solves data availability in the easiest way possible: every node downloads every blob. But obviously this doesn't really scale, so blobs have to be small at first. Danksharding will use a much more sophisticated technique called \"data availability sampling\" (DAS) where a node can request a small number of samples, do some polynomial math, and check the data is available. This allows blobs to become much bigger without being a burden on nodes - and it's leveraging the existence of MEV to put the biggest burden on block builders, which will be optimized and run beefy hardware anyway. With DAS it'll be impossible for a block producer to cheat and claim the data is available when it isn't, because then they wouldn't be able to provide the samples that other validators ask for when deciding whether or not they attest to the block\n\n>4/ How does this affect L2 sequencer profitability?\n\nIt lowers their cost to commit to L1, so it's more profit for them - but competition between rollups will then drive this profit margin down. But I suspect at some point major rollups will be optimized at every level and the difference between $0.001 and $0.0001 per tx is basically unnoticeable to users, so that's more profit if they can squeeze thousands of transactions at these prices inside batches and pocket the difference.

You have to activate your withdrawal address to be able to get rewards past your 32 ETH balance, 32 E is the requirement to run a single solo validator. So for this update, every validator on the network needs to update its withdrawal address to be able to draw on the balance of earning. Most validators are sitting at around 34-ish ETH, so everything past 32 is available to collect on and going forward you will be payed out earnings more regularly to your withdrawal address you set. \n\nAlso, the update allows people to completely wind down their staking duties and get the entire balance back. Prior to this you could only exit duties and shut down the node, but the balance of 32+earned ETH remained locked up. \n\nSo really the update is completing the staking loop. The market will find out if more people are waiting to stake now that the risks are removed, over the the amount of current stakers that are looking to skim and sell for taxes or withdrawal completely and sell. There is both an entrance and exit queue  that operate at about equal rate limitations (so as not to overwhelm the network either way and ensure smooth block production), so we will be able to monitor both.

So for this update, every validator on the network needs to update its withdrawal address to be able to draw on the balance of earning. Most validators are sitting at around 34-ish ETH, so everything past 32 is available to collect on and going forward you will be payed out earnings more regularly to your withdrawal address you set. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the update allows people to completely wind down their staking duties and get the entire balance back. Prior to this you could only exit duties and shut down the node, but the balance of 32+earned ETH remained locked up. </p>\n\n<p>So really the update is completing the staking loop. The market will find out if more people are waiting to stake now that the risks are removed, over the the amount of current stakers that are looking to skim and sell for taxes or withdrawal completely and sell. There is both an entrance and exit queue  that operate at about equal rate limitations (so as not to overwhelm the network either way and ensure smooth block production), so we will be able to monitor both. Also keep in mind people with lots of validators will likely only be withdrawing excess balances just to spin up more, so there will be ETH in the exit queue but it will immediately go back into the entrance queue. Lots of moving parts, but we can monitor it all live.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-12 06:00:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jfyi9uz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12jan7l","parent_id":"t1_jfxmens","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Paid-Not-Payed-Bot","body":"> will be *paid* out earnings\n\nFTFY.\n\nAlthough *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:\n\n * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*\n\n * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out!
