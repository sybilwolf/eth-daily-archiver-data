Merge added a significant load and Shapella did again. \n\nThe main overloads are from:\n\n- disk usage: mainnet need somewhere between 800Gb to 1,5Tb depending on clients you choose. And it's gonna be worth. Use minimum 2Tb drive, 4Tb recommended. It's expensive, but it's also a pain to change the storage mid-flight depending on the setup you have.\n\n- disk load during sync: syncing mainnet is not a trivial operation, and can break in the middle if disks can't handle the load. Again some clients are more sensitive.\nI.e.: Besu is more storage efficient due to Bonzai tree but sync is more sensitive and might break more easily.\n\n- RAM usage is heavier \n\n- network bandwidth / CPU / RAM is put under more stress during sync.\n\nI was happily validating with Besu before merge, but since then I had to tweak again my setup and re-consider my EL client. Re-syncing a new client takes 3 to 5+ days.\n\nSo before you setup your validators, make sure you have a viable synced setup.
