However, they do not let you choose which consensus or execution client to use (for good reason since they have to manage any problems), so that is fairly centralized.  </p>\n\n<p>My only significant centralization concern is that their management and decision making seems quite centralized and opaque (albeit highly responsive and helpful) and they ask you to just trust them that they have a back up plan if the CEO or key technical staff becomes unavailable for any reason.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-19 15:11:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jgxt61y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12qb6uw","parent_id":"t1_jgxhqp3","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/somedaysitsdark","body":"I finished my [validator server build!](https://imgur.com/a/HkgmHMJ) <- sexy pics here\n\nThe [parts list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VH6Yk9), plus the stuff below.\n\n+ [Sliger CX3152a](https://www.sliger.com/products/rackmount/3u/cx3152a/)\n\n+ [M.2 heat sink](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KDDKDNN)\n\n+ [3 Way 4 Pin PWM Fan Splitter Cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXLHNZ6)\n\nI did manage to save a few bucks getting my CPU used locally, and getting a good deal on the SSD.

I try to take people at their word and only posted this because I was pretty positive you were looking to learn for real. Fair warning, long post :O\n\nSo for starters, I'm not gonna sugar-coat my biases but I try to view these things as objectively as I can when it comes to these types of discussions. I live in a state that not deep south red, but has for sure leaned more and more Republican as of late and is now easily considered a 'Red State'. I say that as the anecdotal stories may be part of my area of the country, but I can guarantee my experiences aren't mine alone. As well as I live within a short drive from a major US city you'd absolutely recognize, so it's not like I'm in farm country here either - I have been exposed to the progressive areas as well. \n\nYou've pretty much nailed the issue on the head with your response - the two party system doesn't give us a release valve for the fringe edges of the political spectrum to go to, so they get slopped into the general parties. The reality sort of sinks in when we look at this one line you wrote: \n\n>So with our multi party system, I can have normal respect and debates with anyone that is not in the crazy alt-right party, which is over 80% of the population. I feel that is a minimum\n\nThat is what is happening in America, but since it's two parties the entire Republican side is the \"crazy alt-right\" and the entire left is the \"crazy liberals!\" (of course, depending which \"side\" you are on). It's no 80%, it's the 50% in your party and its the 50/50 split. I mean Biden is probably one of the most center-leaning Democrats, and yet look how vastly different his views are compared to the most center-leaning Republicans. There is a massive divide in the parties. \n\nHere's a great example. My father has lived his entire life probably 1000 miles removed from any single point of the Mexican border. Has never mentioned immigration to me at any point in my life, at least that I remember. Yet last year I had to listen to him rant and rave about Biden letting rapists and drug dealers into the US and they should stop everyone at the border. And if people are here illegally they should be forced to get the vaccine, even though no one in the US should be forced to get it because they aren't US citizens. But it's okay because they are criminals! Really just... you can imagine... Did we discuss feasible methods to stop it? Did we discuss replacing our declining birth-rate through better immigration policy? The economic impacts? Improving Mexican lives so they don't want to come over as much? Nope... all focused on illegals are breaking the law and I did it the right way so too bad. If I bring up other issues I'm some type of asshole or some non-sequitur to bitch about some other liberal bashing point. \n\nSo then it gets into \"well why don't you just accept the other viewpoints in good faith?\" Which is probably where I should add here, it's not like Covid-levels of isolation. I still hang out with my friends, family so on (some I've given up on or only if I'm forced too do it at mutual events)... but there is this slight dread or uneasiness where you just want to avoid certain topics or hope someone doesn't start ranting. You'd be surprised how few safe topics exist once you get past the first 'normal' few topics. Which double sucks when something like my excitement for electric cars, for example, seems like a safe topic to discuss but it turns political because I'm a vegetarian hippie pushing an agenda and directly causing child slavery...\n\nBut anyway, the concept of respecting other viewpoints is great when we are talking about casino permits or if marijuana should be allowed for medical use or how best to boost the local economy. But no, it's discussions on abortions, gay marriage, climate change, healthcare, racism. Things that become hard stop, potential family/friendship killers because respecting the other side is flat-out morally bankrupting. Here's some quick hits I'm talking about:\n\n* My wife, how does she listen to someone telling her if she has medical complications while pregnant she should just roll the dice and hope to not die even though medical treatment is available because she is past 6 weeks?\n* My LGBT friends, how do they have a respectful discourse with people who want to take away their right to marriage?\n* My cousins in inter-racial marriages, how they stomach listening to a grandparent who literally never wants to see the husband in their house because of his skin color?\n* As someone with a disabled father, how do I even begin to cope with people calling me a Chinese / Russian communist because I want better healthcare for him and others?\n\nIt's stuff like that that just becomes non-starters. It's stressful and just sours conversations, to put it lightly. They are all real things that happened with me or people I know, and happen alot in the US. People outwardly say this stuff or indirectly do so by very actively supporting it.\n\n>I bet there are plenty of good people supporting bad policies. I don't really believe that almost 50% is genuinely racist either.\n\nThe US on the whole, probably not. But I think you would be absolutely floored with the amount of *casual* racism in the US, and if I ran through a short-list of my Republican friends, I'd put it at an easy 50% of them have said / acted in ways that would simply not fly in a mix-raced setting. Again, this may be my location however.\n\n>A lot of this is news to me but that sounds scary. Are gay marriage and abortion rights really on the decline?\n\nYes. Full stop. I know a lot of people like to sweep stuff under the rug or pass it off as media sensationalism... but it's happening. Roe v Wade was overturned, meaning a ton of states are now doing these 6-week or less week abortion bans. \n\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion\\_law\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States\\_by\\_state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law_in_the_United_States_by_state)\n* [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62158357](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62158357)\n* [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lizelle-herrera-abortion-texas-murder-charge-dropped/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lizelle-herrera-abortion-texas-murder-charge-dropped/)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death\\_of\\_Savita\\_Halappanavar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) (Ireland, but an example of the issues when these doctors start leaving Red states or fear represcussiosn from them)\n\nThe defense of marriage act passed at the federal level, but plenty of states still ban it - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex\\_marriage\\_law\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States\\_by\\_state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_law_in_the_United_States_by_state).

It is a state-by-state issue, so while California might be (broadly) okay with all these things, that does nothing to help all the people living in the more conservative states. So your going to get mixed viewpoints on all this because of that, but there are millions being directly affected by this stuff and it's only getting worse.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Hey man, I&#39;m here to learn so thanks for showing me your perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Absolutely, and please don&#39;t take my post as combative. I try to take people at their word and only posted this because I was pretty positive you were looking to learn for real. Fair warning, long post :O</p>\n\n<p>So for starters, I&#39;m not gonna sugar-coat my biases but I try to view these things as objectively as I can when it comes to these types of discussions. I live in a state that not deep south red, but has for sure leaned more and more Republican as of late and is now easily considered a &#39;Red State&#39;. I say that as the anecdotal stories may be part of my area of the country, but I can guarantee my experiences aren&#39;t mine alone. As well as I live within a short drive from a major US city you&#39;d absolutely recognize, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m in farm country here either - I have been exposed to the progressive areas as well. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve pretty much nailed the issue on the head with your response - the two party system doesn&#39;t give us a release valve for the fringe edges of the political spectrum to go to, so they get slopped into the general parties. The reality sort of sinks in when we look at this one line you wrote: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So with our multi party system, I can have normal respect and debates with anyone that is not in the crazy alt-right party, which is over 80% of the population. I feel that is a minimum</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is what is happening in America, but since it&#39;s two parties the entire Republican side is the &quot;crazy alt-right&quot; and the entire left is the &quot;crazy liberals!&quot; (of course, depending which &quot;side&quot; you are on). It&#39;s no 80%, it&#39;s the 50% in your party and its the 50/50 split. I mean Biden is probably one of the most center-leaning Democrats, and yet look how vastly different his views are compared to the most center-leaning Republicans. There is a massive divide in the parties. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a great example. My father has lived his entire life probably 1000 miles removed from any single point of the Mexican border. Has never mentioned immigration to me at any point in my life, at least that I remember. Yet last year I had to listen to him rant and rave about Biden letting rapists and drug dealers into the US and they should stop everyone at the border. And if people are here illegally they should be forced to get the vaccine, even though no one in the US should be forced to get it because they aren&#39;t US citizens. But it&#39;s okay because they are criminals! Really just... you can imagine... Did we discuss feasible methods to stop it? Did we discuss replacing our declining birth-rate through better immigration policy? The economic impacts? Improving Mexican lives so they don&#39;t want to come over as much? Nope... all focused on illegals are breaking the law and I did it the right way so too bad. If I bring up other issues I&#39;m some type of asshole or some non-sequitur to bitch about some other liberal bashing point. </p>\n\n<p>So then it gets into &quot;well why don&#39;t you just accept the other viewpoints in good faith?&quot; Which is probably where I should add here, it&#39;s not like Covid-levels of isolation. I still hang out with my friends, family so on (some I&#39;ve given up on or only if I&#39;m forced too do it at mutual events)... but there is this slight dread or uneasiness where you just want to avoid certain topics or hope someone doesn&#39;t start ranting. You&#39;d be surprised how few safe topics exist once you get past the first &#39;normal&#39; few topics. Which double sucks when something like my excitement for electric cars, for example, seems like a safe topic to discuss but it turns political because I&#39;m a vegetarian hippie pushing an agenda and directly causing child slavery...</p>\n\n<p>But anyway, the concept of respecting other viewpoints is great when we are talking about casino permits or if marijuana should be allowed for medical use or how best to boost the local economy.

You are right, I am looking to learn for real. I am both interested in this topic from a sociological / psychological standpoint and concerned about the growing polarization in the USA and other parts of the world. First of all let me tell you where I am coming from with my comments in the first place. After I will respond to some particular parts of your story.\n\nI have a point of view that a lot of people in the world have the potential to be good but are easily misguided and manipulated. Misguided, it may sound like I don't think it's a big deal but I actually think it's hugely important and responsible for some of the worst things that humanity has done in its history. And I see our tribal nature as one of the root causes. The same person that is capable of great self sacrifice and loyalty to their friends and family can wish literal death on 'the other'. The further the division between tribes grows, the more people are capable of dehumanizing the other and actively wishing them harm. And I wish to find out how to combat that fact. The only way I know how is to stay connected and keep seeing eachother's humanity. That's why it's so greatly worrying to me to see that even here, in a tight community like this, it only takes a few political comments and people are reacting so strongly that they can not hang out in the same place anymore. If we can not see our shared humanity in here, despite our differences, then where? The more isolated the two tribes become, the more the other becomes dehumanized and the more radical we all become and it saddens me.\n\nFurthermore, I am unfairly holding everyone here to a higher standard than the average person, because I know you are generally intelligent, open minded and able to cut through bullshit media manipulation. If it's not you guys coming together, then who will?\n\nNow your post has made it a **lot** more real to me and I do realize I'm sitting here preaching from a super privileged position. You have a good way with words and I was able to imagine your situation pretty vividly. There are indeed a lot of points where it's a completely different experience from my life so I can not know how I would be in the same situation.\n\nThe story about your father especially hit it home for me, because it is your father. It makes me realize that there are many interactions and relationships soured like that. Sometimes I think I know or can imagine what you are living because I have two friends that have gone deep into the conspiracy rabbit-hole and who talk remarkably similar to your father. They say they are not gay or racist, but have to make angry comments every time a rainbow flag comes on because it pushes the liberal agenda / ''Trans cult\". There are many such examples. Why are they friends? Well they were friends in high school and good dudes by then, but they have not been succesful in life and are pretty socially isolated. Social isolation is what led to their extreme views and I don't want to isolate them even further by breaking contact. I have hope left.\n\nI pride myself on being patient with them and trying to find common ground, but to be honest it is exhausting and I don't see them that often. For the rest all of my close family and friends are pretty much sane. Furthermore there is no fear at all that abortion (legal since the 70s) and gay marriage (surprisingly only legal since early 00) will be banned. The fringe issues here are more about racism and immigrants and although hugely important, have less impact on me personally.\n\nNow about discourse, the point is not to let bad opinions off the hook, but to not lose eachother completely. I wouldn't ask anyone to be lovey-dovey to someone that literally hates them based on race or sexual preference. I wouldn't ask a conservative's opinion about my marriage or my wife's abortion either. But assuming that everyone that would ever vote conservative is so far gone that they are not worth talking to also does not seem ideal. You only have 2 parties so there may be a lot of reasons why people might vote against the democrats.\n\nAnd I agree that it would probably be misguided at best and morally wrong at worst, but it doesn't have to be blind racism or the wish to limit basic human rights. It can be fear of the rapid change, disconnect with the political discourse of the liberal elite.  Feelings that you are not represented and that things are worse for your generation than for the previous ones.\n\nWhen economic times are bad there are lots of reasons why people might be disenfranchised and easily captured by the nice words of a populist. The only way to combat that is to take genuine time listening to where the concerns, hate and fear actually come from. They probably don't even know themselves. All discourse stays on the surface about highly politicized subjects where people just hate eachother more and more.\n\nEverything you wrote about the decline in human rights and living with people that carry opinions like that is hugely scary to me and it does really make me understand your and John's position. But it makes it all the more important for people across tribes to keep seeing the common humanity in eachother.\n\nI'm not asking you to do it, but I do hope some people will. A healthy democracy depends on it. Once again, realizing my easy position of privilege here, and also realize that people that discuss this on podcasts that I listen to are similarly privileged because they might live in California or a different liberal bubble.\n\nGonna end with shilling one of my favorite podcasts here with a fantastic host that investigates human bias and lately in particular the topic of persuasion. This is just one example of a recent episode on the topic but there are lots more.\n\n[https://youarenotsosmart.com/2023/04/02/yanss-256-anand-giridharadas-wants-americans-to-change-their-minds-about-their-ability-change-other-americans-minds/](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2023/04/02/yanss-256-anand-giridharadas-wants-americans-to-change-their-minds-about-their-ability-change-other-americans-minds/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for taking the time to guide me through your experience.

Social isolation is what led to their extreme views and I don&#39;t want to isolate them even further by breaking contact. I have hope left.</p>\n\n<p>I pride myself on being patient with them and trying to find common ground, but to be honest it is exhausting and I don&#39;t see them that often. For the rest all of my close family and friends are pretty much sane. Furthermore there is no fear at all that abortion (legal since the 70s) and gay marriage (surprisingly only legal since early 00) will be banned. The fringe issues here are more about racism and immigrants and although hugely important, have less impact on me personally.</p>\n\n<p>Now about discourse, the point is not to let bad opinions off the hook, but to not lose eachother completely. I wouldn&#39;t ask anyone to be lovey-dovey to someone that literally hates them based on race or sexual preference. I wouldn&#39;t ask a conservative&#39;s opinion about my marriage or my wife&#39;s abortion either. But assuming that everyone that would ever vote conservative is so far gone that they are not worth talking to also does not seem ideal. You only have 2 parties so there may be a lot of reasons why people might vote against the democrats.</p>\n\n<p>And I agree that it would probably be misguided at best and morally wrong at worst, but it doesn&#39;t have to be blind racism or the wish to limit basic human rights. It can be fear of the rapid change, disconnect with the political discourse of the liberal elite.  Feelings that you are not represented and that things are worse for your generation than for the previous ones.</p>\n\n<p>When economic times are bad there are lots of reasons why people might be disenfranchised and easily captured by the nice words of a populist. The only way to combat that is to take genuine time listening to where the concerns, hate and fear actually come from. They probably don&#39;t even know themselves. All discourse stays on the surface about highly politicized subjects where people just hate eachother more and more.</p>\n\n<p>Everything you wrote about the decline in human rights and living with people that carry opinions like that is hugely scary to me and it does really make me understand your and John&#39;s position. But it makes it all the more important for people across tribes to keep seeing the common humanity in eachother.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not asking you to do it, but I do hope some people will. A healthy democracy depends on it. Once again, realizing my easy position of privilege here, and also realize that people that discuss this on podcasts that I listen to are similarly privileged because they might live in California or a different liberal bubble.</p>\n\n<p>Gonna end with shilling one of my favorite podcasts here with a fantastic host that investigates human bias and lately in particular the topic of persuasion. This is just one example of a recent episode on the topic but there are lots more.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youarenotsosmart.com/2023/04/02/yanss-256-anand-giridharadas-wants-americans-to-change-their-minds-about-their-ability-change-other-americans-minds/\">https://youarenotsosmart.com/2023/04/02/yanss-256-anand-giridharadas-wants-americans-to-change-their-minds-about-their-ability-change-other-americans-minds/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-20 14:16:13","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-04-20 14:45:58","id":"jh2cjnq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12qb6uw","parent_id":"t1_jgx7w5a","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"Hey I'm really sorry, I was super busy the last few days and had not had a few minutes to string together a good and thoughtful response. I did read your post, and thanks again for taking the time to read all this / have the open and honest conversation.\n\nThanks for sharing your point of view that frames the responses. I wish I could be that optimistic, unfortunately I think I've just been jaded as I've gotten older and gone through more life experiences. (Please read that as just a general introspective comment on myself, not to imply I'm more experienced or something!... I know how text can come off!) FWIW, I know you are \"right\" here. From a philosophical standpoint I'm not going to deny the that... in modern society tribalism is bad and I wish people could get along better.\n\nI'm glad to hear me (and assuming some others who posted here) have made an impact on your views, in hopefully a good way. I know the opinions I and others expressed are fairly defeatist. Also, I didn't want to imply like you were speaking from privilege or anything, but I did want to bring in context as I think there are a lot of situations where if people don't live it they don't fully get it. It does seem you do have some experiences there, and I'm sorry to hear you have friends who you have had similar experiences with. I'm hoping they / you can help turn it around. I also appreciate your responses, and I have taken things away as well. If at a minimum some hope as it seems Europe is doing better than us and maybe that will bleed over at some point.\n\nIt's interesting you mention they have social isolation and failure in life issues. That is a fairly common and consistent theme I think among those who go far alt-right, or have those views, at least in my experience. Again, anecdotal... but there is absolutely a correlation between friends that graduated college and have had life success being fairly liberal versus those who dropped out and hate their life being fairly right-wing. The right-leaning talking heads / political candidates do a (scarily) good job of pandering to this and become relatable due to that. So in fairness, I can admit a lot of the problem people were once good but have gotten basically brainwashed to have this 10% of vile-ness come out.\n\nI don't want to go crazy long into a response (spoiler: I didn't do well :\\] ), just because I don't want to drag you through a topic for weeks on end haha, but in terms of the rest of your response I did want you to know I read it all (a few times) and appreciate you sharing it. I'm not really a podcast person, like... at all... but I'll probably try to give it a listen.\n\nIn your final half of the response, I see you hit on themes of basically not letting these people completely go as they may not believe the fringe things but align with conservativism for other reasons, or maybe they don't really realize it... things like that. And I hope I didn't mis-interpret that, but I wanted to just touch on that.\n\nI think a reality is this solution has become a non-started for a lot of left leaning Millenials / Gen Z. The counter-point to all this is that a lot of this rhetoric is **abuse**, and no one should have to willingly put up with that. There are some wrongs you really can't make right with outside actions or reasons. You mentioned racism was a big issue, so to sort of work with that. How do you sit there as a millennial in an interracial marriage, with interracial children, and accept people being blatantly racist? There is no middle ground when these people think you are sub-human and should be considered property. Confederate flags (the flag of the south during our civil war, which was mainly fought over the right to own slaves) can be seen daily (I'm literally not exaggerating). In all 50 states too - i.e. states that fought against the south or didn't even exist during that time frame. You are supposed to feel like you are socially safe when your peers support that? Or that you are getting a fair trial when people on the jury support that? As the white spouse, your going to try and defend that and risk losing your partner and childs respect?\n\nSo to throw in my bias here, what I truly and honestly believe is 4 out of 5 times there is a genuine interest in the left wanting to do what you said, but the right has blocked it by taking such untenable and hostile stances. It's completely unfair to ask the **abused** party to try and fix their **abuser**. This is the main point I like to get across in this conversation, so I'll repeat:\n\n**It is completely unfair to ask the abused part to try and fix their abuser.**\n\nSo that's why you see a lot of people like me and John. We want to fix it and want to work across the aisle, but it is simply unfair to ask us to do so. And the times we try with the 'softer' stances (say, environmentalism) it's impossible because these people tend to be pretty closed off to change (as you noted, they may be simply afraid of rapid change and it's called conservatism for a reason!). It's something that has always struck me as unfair, and why you will see a lot of frustration and low/no contact from the left. I think the context that matters for this sub, as the posts we complain about are people who just spout off this stuff for no reason.\n\nLastly to leave on a high note, I know this whole conversation is very doom and gloom, but I've seen positive outcomes. Believe it or not, I actually was roommates with someone who was president of the college's young republican club. He's been disgusted with the actions since then (about 10 years now) and has been really good about staying away from that stuff. I'm probably technically a success story (as well as a couple of my friends I grew up with) as we were exposed to a lot the conservative 'ideals' growing up and strayed away from the extreme-ism. So there is hope for some, I just fear for those too far gone.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey I&#39;m really sorry, I was super busy the last few days and had not had a few minutes to string together a good and thoughtful response.

I wanted to keep this brief but it turns out I'm just as bad in that as you are, if not worse.\n\n>Hey I'm really sorry, I was super busy the last few days and had not had a few minutes to string together a good and thoughtful response. I did read your post, and thanks again for taking the time to read all this / have the open and honest conversation.\n\nHey no worries at all. It's been exactly the same way for me now. Even though I read your post multiple times already, it's not something one offhandedly replies to.\n\n>I'm glad to hear me (and assuming some others who posted here) have made an impact on your views, in hopefully a good way.\n\nThey certainly have in three ways. First it made me realize I shouldn't be quick to judge someone for avoiding politics or avoiding a space with a lot of people that have opposing political beliefs. The beliefs themselves aren't trivial and moreover, our emotional reactions to them are very real and can affect our mood and energy. People go to Ethfinance for many different reasons, and if you leave this daily in a worse mood than when you found it, then taking a break is obviously the right thing to do. We all have shit going on in our own lives already, some worse than others, so not everyone has the mental capacity left to deal with that stuff. I didn't properly consider the emotional effect that these kind of discussions can have, especially when it's in a close community that you had a high regard for.\n\nSecondly I should extend at least as much empathy and patience towards people with inclusive values that are on my side, as I do towards people on the other side (probably more so). Like I said I *unfairly* hold everyone here to a higher standard, because I have such a high opinion of you all. I've actually had this happen before in my real life too, once a good friend was annoyed with me because he thought I judged him harsher in a situation than some other guys. After some introspection I realized it was true, because I felt those other guys don't know any better. I do have high standards for myself but I shouldn't hold others to that same standard because I don't know everyone's personal circumstances.\n\nThirdly, and probably related to your most important point, I should know and acknowledge that these reactions do not happen in a vacuum. Like you say here\n\n>So that's why you see a lot of people like me and John. We want to fix it and want to work across the aisle, but it is simply unfair to ask us to do so.\n\nI don't actually know how many times you have already tried and failed and it is indeed unfair to ask anyone to commit this labor.\n\nI haven't changed my mind on the importance of finding common ground, but more on that later in this comment\n\n>Again, anecdotal... but there is absolutely a correlation between friends that graduated college and have had life success being fairly liberal versus those who dropped out and hate their life being fairly right-wing.\n\nI have the same anecdotal experience. Speculation on my part is that they don't feel in control of their life and can not take responsibility in how their life turned out. Maybe they had hopes and dreams, tried and failed a couple of times and now they believe the game is rigged and they don't control their own destiny. If you don't think you can control the direction of your life, you start looking for blame. The republican party is very good at channeling that and directing it to the liberal elite. Our alt-right party does exactly the same.\n\n>I'm not really a podcast person, like... at all... but I'll probably try to give it a listen.\n\nDon't feel obligated to listen just to humor me haha. It hits on a few topics about understanding and changing the mind of a conservative and putting social change in perspective in terms of just how much has actually changed in the last couple of decades.\n\n>How do you sit there as a millennial in an interracial marriage, with interracial children, and accept people being blatantly racist? There is no middle ground when these people think you are sub-human and should be considered property.\n\nI don't have to imagine, my girlfriend is asian and it really depends on the situation. I've been in a few situations that relate to this with different outcomes.Casual racism: A friend's brother and his friends make a racist joke about asians. I engage them directly and ask what they mean with it. Bring the topic of my girlfriend in the conversation and ask if they meant her. The answer is usually either *\"She's different\"* or \"*just a joke lol\"*. I've gotten defensive reactions a couple of times, but also some hopeful acknowledgement of wrong doing a few weeks later.\n\nHateful racism: During the beginning of Covid she was screamed at by a couple of assholes on the street and she had to bike away fast. I wasn't there unfortunately but I would most definitely fight for her. Zero tolerance for that shit.\n\n>It is completely unfair to ask the abused part to try and fix their abuser.\n\nI totally take your point here and it was unfair to ask this. This work of working across the aisle, of engaging with the other should be totally voluntary for anyone that feels up for it.\n\nThere is one part of that where I do have to disagree slightly, or at least put up some nuance. I don't equate all republicans to be the abusers and all democrats to be the abused. I don't mean to put words in your mouth and maybe you wouldn't say that either, but I do think there is some important nuance lost there.\n\nI would never ask a gay man to engage with someone that hates gays. I also wouldn't ask a black man to talk to white supremacist. I wouldn't ask **anyone** that has incurred some sort of trauma because of the hateful actions or opinions of another to reach out and be the bigger person. If they do it of their own volition they have my deepest respect but it's not up to them to fix it.\n\n*However* there are plenty of healthy and successful people that got lucky in life and do not have this trauma. I put myself in this category. I have had loving parents, I didn't grow up in poverty. I have friends and I have a steady job. I found romantic love and I am able to travel the world at times. All of this has shaped me to be capable of love and understanding and to be patient. It is insane how much regular dose of oxytocin and social support impact your personality, and even more insane how much the lack of it does.\n\nContrast this with one of my conspiracy friends, who was always fighting with his dad since he was a little kid. Bordering on abuse. Who has not found romantic love and barely has any friends. Who hasn't seen his parents in months and hasn't had a proper hug in years. Imagine what that does to the brain. How can I judge him for being hateful. Is it not up to me to be the bigger person and be patient. Don't get me wrong, there are things he could do that would go too far like if he was outwardly racist or hateful towards someone I care about. But fortunately he doesn't. Yet he still votes for hateful people. There is a disconnect there between what he would personally do and who he supports. And it's my naive thinking that this is much wider spread. I truly don't believe that all republicans would be outwardly racist to people they meet in the streets, but I acknowledge that their votes and actions can be just as harmful.\n\nI am left leaning in my thinking, and believe the widest shoulders should carry the heaviest load. Not just economically, but also in the space of ideas. If you are like me and fortunate enough to have received so much love in your life, you are just more capable of patience and love and reaching out.\n\nI don't mean to say that we should reach out to everyone. The worst racists and fascists, the knowingly hateful people that have no childhood trauma to justify it and the ones doing the grifting and manipulating don't get my sympathy. To those people we have to stand up and not take their shit. We need warrior-like people like you and John that have zero tolerance for their bullshit. A healthy society has both warriors that defend its values and bridge builders that convince people that their values are right.\n\nAll in all I think we agree more than we disagree and I'm glad we had this conversation. I think it's actually a healthy thing that some people have zero tolerance for hate and other people try to look beyond the hate and see if there is a human behind it worth saving.\n\nCheers Bob, glad we had this talk","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Fair warning..

Yet he still votes for hateful people. There is a disconnect there between what he would personally do and who he supports. And it&#39;s my naive thinking that this is much wider spread. I truly don&#39;t believe that all republicans would be outwardly racist to people they meet in the streets, but I acknowledge that their votes and actions can be just as harmful.</p>\n\n<p>I am left leaning in my thinking, and believe the widest shoulders should carry the heaviest load. Not just economically, but also in the space of ideas. If you are like me and fortunate enough to have received so much love in your life, you are just more capable of patience and love and reaching out.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t mean to say that we should reach out to everyone. The worst racists and fascists, the knowingly hateful people that have no childhood trauma to justify it and the ones doing the grifting and manipulating don&#39;t get my sympathy. To those people we have to stand up and not take their shit. We need warrior-like people like you and John that have zero tolerance for their bullshit. A healthy society has both warriors that defend its values and bridge builders that convince people that their values are right.</p>\n\n<p>All in all I think we agree more than we disagree and I&#39;m glad we had this conversation. I think it&#39;s actually a healthy thing that some people have zero tolerance for hate and other people try to look beyond the hate and see if there is a human behind it worth saving.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers Bob, glad we had this talk</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-25 10:37:29","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-04-25 10:52:48","id":"jhofywe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12qb6uw","parent_id":"t1_jheivou","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"Hey, glad to see your response.
