If any friend wants their money back, or is unhappy with the way the staking rig is being run, they can publish the exit message and the ETH will go back into the custom contract.

I think you&#39;re absolutely right that regulation of CEXs should be doable, and is important for crypto adoption.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The primary problem with GG is that he&#39;s not acting in good faith here. He&#39;s doing regulation by enforcement rather than by providing any sort of clarity to developers. He claims that people can &quot;just come in&quot; to work with the sec comply with laws but by all accounts thats straight up impossible. He&#39;s essentially trying to make himself king and rule by decree rather than by any reasonable consensus.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This is the story that I keep reading.  I just wonder how much of it is exaggeration combined with echo chamber, and how much of it is truth.  I&#39;m not a lawyer, and I certainly haven&#39;t read in depth first hand documentation of what he has done or is trying to do.  I&#39;m really just a common man who reads what everyone else reads.</p>\n\n<p>While oversight by the CFTC might not be more appropriate, it feels as though the general consensus is that it would be preferable.  It may be as simple as GG not being bought out, and the CFTC chair Rostin Behnam is.</p>\n\n<p>Humor my tinfoil for a second.  Rostin Behnam has, multiple times now, waived swap reporting in tradefi, which only benefits the biggest players.. banks, hedge funds, etc.  There&#39;s some pretty damning speculation that swaps are at least partially the cause of all this bank stress we&#39;ve seen lately.. As in there were some bad swaps made, and now counterparty risk is coming into play.  If there&#39;s a major banking crisis down the road, and the only way out is for the FED to print, I feel pretty confident crypto stands to gain significantly from it.  In which case, crypto would be the life raft.  People with close ties to the banking system would see it on the horizon, and maybe all this GG hate we&#39;re seeing pushed around is just smart money trying to protect the life raft.  Tinfoil off...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-19 13:16:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jgxbkp7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12rhig4","parent_id":"t1_jgwp9pw","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/eviljordan","body":"Biting my tongue so hard my lungs are filled with blood.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Biting my tongue so hard my lungs are filled with blood.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-19 13:12:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jgxaxsh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12rhig4","parent_id":"t1_jgwmh4d","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"It's not divide and conquer by whales per se, but if I had to guess there are probably some efforts to push stonks over crypto to retail investors.
