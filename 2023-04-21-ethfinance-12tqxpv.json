I personally decided to sell part of my longterm stack for a deposit on a house earlier this week, as a hedge, I\u2019m bullish on ETH but bearish on the world. Pretty proud of myself for taking some significant profits actually, especially given ETH was up 68% on the ytd when I did it.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I\u2019m not the only one. For me it\u2019s a cointoss whether we end this year higher or lower than here, not taking anything for granted, up or down from here I\u2019m happy.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-21 00:53:52","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-04-21 00:57:21","id":"jh4b9e2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12tqxpv","parent_id":"t1_jh49z64","score":30,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ETHdude8686","body":"Congrats on the house!

This makes it so that even during periods of high network urgency, such as on Black Thursday when MakerDAO was urgently unwinding positions at 400 gwei during the flash crash from $194-$111 ETH, grandma has a network guarantee that she is able to concurrently use part of the blockchain's bandwidth at low cost to breed her cryptokitty.\n\nFrom the paper:\n\n> Nevertheless the dominant approach in blockchain systems and Bitcoin as well as in modelling transaction fee mechanisms casts the process of accessing blockchain space as a first price auction where users competing for blockchain space try to outbid each other only at the highest level urgency. This results in a situation where at a time of network congestion, the applications with the highest urgency and value will drive the transaction prices high \u2014 even to a degree that low urgency applications may become too expensive to use. This state of affairs comes in sharp contrast with the promise of these systems as egalitarian workspaces where different developers and users can deploy applications and use them concurrently.\n\nSorry but I don't agree with the premise of blockchains being \"egalitarian workspaces\". Block space is a commodity, and commodities have supply and demand. If you want to give people free food, you don't force the farmers to sell off their potatoes in tiers - you raise money through a government or nonprofit, and then pay the farmer full price. (On Ethereum in the future, this might look like a \"transaction fee fund\", where if your transaction results in some particular social good, you get a transaction fee rebate from a third party, which can be done permissionlessly at the smart contract layer.)\n\nSupply and demand is how every other major blockchain works, including Ethereum - every 12 seconds on average, 15 Million potatoes come off the conveyor belt and are auctioned off (EIP-1559 slightly smooths supply over time but ultimately does not change the total amount). Basically, Cardano is considering trying out an alternative to supply and demand; an alternative to free markets. Is there any precedent for this type of tiered commodity pricing scheme in real world history?\n\nLow urgency transactions *should* wait during periods of network congestion - that means there are more important things for the chain to be doing at the moment, evidenced by the high urgency transactions outbidding the low urgency ones. This seems like common sense.\n\n> The delay penalty is enforced by delaying the processing of transactions included in a tier by the tier\u2019s delay, i.e., for all ledger purposes a transaction is ignored until a block is produced whose timestamp exceeds that of the inclusion block by the delay amount. Accordingly, transactions that are added to a tier pay a fee equal to the tier\u2019s price.\n\nSo this is how it works: They introduce an artificial delay to most of Cardano's block space, so that in the general case, Cardano transactions become slower and shittier. Every block has multiple service tiers, the less you pay, the more your transaction is artificially delayed. If you pay a lot more, you can squeak into the small amount of undelayed block space.\n\nThis slower shittier transaction space handicaps the blockchain's overall utility, causing people to bid less money on its block space, making it easier for cheaper transactions to go through (eventually), which makes the chain more \"inclusive\".\n\nThey claim that the increased revenue through charging extra for their premium, undelayed block space will make up for them charging less for the delayed space, but I can't see how that could be the case. If I'm right and Cardano ended up earning less total fee revenue due to this change, then it would be direct evidence of a decrease in the chain's total utility, as supply and demand economics dictates that people are willing to pay a price equal to the benefit they receive.\n\nI've seen some pretty idiotic ideas come out of IOG, but this one is in a special world of its own.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> They believe that blockchains should have different &quot;tiers&quot; of service in every block in the name of inclusivity. This makes it so that even during periods of high network urgency, such as on Black Thursday when MakerDAO was urgently unwinding positions at 400 gwei during the flash crash from $194-$111 ETH, grandma has a network guarantee that she is able to concurrently use part of the blockchain&#39;s bandwidth at low cost to breed her cryptokitty.</p>\n\n<p>From the paper:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless the dominant approach in blockchain systems and Bitcoin as well as in modelling transaction fee mechanisms casts the process of accessing blockchain space as a first price auction where users competing for blockchain space try to outbid each other only at the highest level urgency. This results in a situation where at a time of network congestion, the applications with the highest urgency and value will drive the transaction prices high \u2014 even to a degree that low urgency applications may become too expensive to use. This state of affairs comes in sharp contrast with the promise of these systems as egalitarian workspaces where different developers and users can deploy applications and use them concurrently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sorry but I don&#39;t agree with the premise of blockchains being &quot;egalitarian workspaces&quot;. Block space is a commodity, and commodities have supply and demand. If you want to give people free food, you don&#39;t force the farmers to sell off their potatoes in tiers - you raise money through a government or nonprofit, and then pay the farmer full price. (On Ethereum in the future, this might look like a &quot;transaction fee fund&quot;, where if your transaction results in some particular social good, you get a transaction fee rebate from a third party, which can be done permissionlessly at the smart contract layer.)</p>\n\n<p>Supply and demand is how every other major blockchain works, including Ethereum - every 12 seconds on average, 15 Million potatoes come off the conveyor belt and are auctioned off (EIP-1559 slightly smooths supply over time but ultimately does not change the total amount). Basically, Cardano is considering trying out an alternative to supply and demand; an alternative to free markets. Is there any precedent for this type of tiered commodity pricing scheme in real world history?</p>\n\n<p>Low urgency transactions <em>should</em> wait during periods of network congestion - that means there are more important things for the chain to be doing at the moment, evidenced by the high urgency transactions outbidding the low urgency ones. This seems like common sense.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The delay penalty is enforced by delaying the processing of transactions included in a tier by the tier\u2019s delay, i.e., for all ledger purposes a transaction is ignored until a block is produced whose timestamp exceeds that of the inclusion block by the delay amount.
