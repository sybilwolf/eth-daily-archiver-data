Vitalik and co don\u2019t like the fact that anyone attacking PoS will be aided by rocket Pool in growing their share of the network. Personally, I find the view overly simplistic.

It\u2019s also completely transparent to see which node operators are growing in size. I find the marginal gain for an attacker to be mediocre.

I only won the raffle from one. I'm glad that happened and it was for the best yet it's still important to note my entrances.\n\nWhy is it important to mention?\n\nBecause it highlights my thinking at that time pretty well. I thought of it more as free money\u2014free ether. You just trade your JPEGs for free ether. And at worst, you can sell one to get free money while keeping the other one. Well, after winning the raffle with only one wallet, I had to make a choice. My mindset of just getting more ether was pretty dominant, that's why I was hoping to mint a rare one, a holy or a cyber. I remember deliberately looking at mints and just waiting a certain time before one is minted so I can try my chances, I was hoping it would increase my 'perceived' chances because I knew it actually had no impact on the randomness.

You get too attached to it. It's not about the picture to me but about the community. And EVMavericks community is priceless.\n\nWhile I was excited to join and there was a bit less stress to participate, unlike on Reddit, because I didn't really have much to add and there have always been amazing discussions.

Obviously, you can even question whether the roles are needed and whether you want to fit or not but let's skip over that for now. Since EVMavericks wanted to build and with the ways DAO works, contributing in a concrete way has been really valuable. I'm sure the DAO itself has been quite a challenging and learning experience for all of us.\n\nSo while I was still quite new to the Ethereum ecosystem on a practical level and to the community, there were not many practical things for me to do. Some people started talking about other NFTs and projects and I thought, \"heck why not?!\". I was wrong before, and now holding a lion was proving me wrong then what if I'm wrong about other projects in the ecosystem. Eventually, we created a specific chat for those purposes that included less serious' discussion. It is called - degen chat!\n\nSo in a way, shitposting was the only thing that I was doing. It would take me over 6 months to realize the value of shitposting and having that specific place as degen chat which seems like an unnecessary room yet has had quite a crucial piece in the community.\n\nAs time went by, I made many friends and found other ways to contribute to the communities within and outside.\n\nHowever, I'll be honest, I've flip flopped a lot between being bullish and bearish on the whole DAO and project.\n\nNowadays, I'm still finding my balance within life in general and, thus, with how EVMavericks as a community plays a part in my life. I do my best to keep up the EVMavericks Weekly by noting the few most important events.\n\nThis is just the beginning for EVMavericks and me.\n\nAs you go along with me on this journey of reflections, more pieces will be put together, and we will circle back to EVMavericks to cover all other aspects!\n\nNext up: Twitter Followers!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Continuing my reflections!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/wu8gxFe\">1 Year in NFTs: EVMavericks - the DAO and my journey (4/20/2022 - present)</a></p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\udd81 EVMavericks - a pride valuing decentralization, public goods and education!</p>\n\n<p>My journey begins there by winning a whitelist spot through the raffle for lurkers.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a small yet very important tidbit that I feel is very valuable to share: I have actually entered the last lurkers list from 2 of my accounts.

It would take me over 6 months to realize the value of shitposting and having that specific place as degen chat which seems like an unnecessary room yet has had quite a crucial piece in the community.</p>\n\n<p>As time went by, I made many friends and found other ways to contribute to the communities within and outside.</p>\n\n<p>However, I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve flip flopped a lot between being bullish and bearish on the whole DAO and project.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, I&#39;m still finding my balance within life in general and, thus, with how EVMavericks as a community plays a part in my life. I do my best to keep up the EVMavericks Weekly by noting the few most important events.</p>\n\n<p>This is just the beginning for EVMavericks and me.</p>\n\n<p>As you go along with me on this journey of reflections, more pieces will be put together, and we will circle back to EVMavericks to cover all other aspects!</p>\n\n<p>Next up: Twitter Followers!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-23 21:02:06","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-04-23 21:06:40","id":"jhhaezr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12vwbun","parent_id":"t3_12vwbun","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"Okay okay Argent I know we are down there is no need to send me a notification to rub salt in the wound.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Okay okay Argent I know we are down there is no need to send me a notification to rub salt in the wound.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-23 08:26:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jhehvpw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12vwbun","parent_id":"t3_12vwbun","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/waqwaqattack","body":"At what point have you \u201cmade a million from crypto\u201d? \n\n1) your portfolio app has the number $1,000,000\n\n2) the total profit of your crypto is $1,000,000\n\n3) 1 or 2, but after you factor in tax (explain your answer) \n\n4) the number doesn\u2019t matter, but what matters is your portfolio doing 5x, 10x, 50x or whatever (explain your answer) \n\n\nWhen do you do a ethfinance golden shower?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>At what point have you \u201cmade a million from crypto\u201d? </p>\n\n<p>1) your portfolio app has the number $1,000,000</p>\n\n<p>2) the total profit of your crypto is $1,000,000</p>\n\n<p>3) 1 or 2, but after you factor in tax (explain your answer) </p>\n\n<p>4) the number doesn\u2019t matter, but what matters is your portfolio doing 5x, 10x, 50x or whatever (explain your answer) </p>\n\n<p>When do you do a ethfinance golden shower?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-23 08:43:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jhekanh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12vwbun","parent_id":"t3_12vwbun","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KuDeTa","body":"When i finally stop reading the daily, i will know i've made it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>When i finally stop reading the daily, i will know i&#39;ve made it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-23 12:06:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jhfdphh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12vwbun","parent_id":"t1_jhekanh","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/_etherium","body":"mindless puzzled deer whole sip vanish wrong outgoing rainstorm attraction\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>mindless puzzled deer whole sip vanish wrong outgoing rainstorm attraction</p>\n\n<p><em>This post was mass deleted and anonymized with <a href=\"https://redact.dev\">Redact</a></em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-23 12:23:52","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-08-04 12:57:13","id":"jhfg7zj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12vwbun","parent_id":"t1_jhekanh","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"When you have the stable ability to withdraw enough funds to have netted $1m in cash after taxes...

The answer to whether liquidity farming is worth it to a protocol depends on that protocols goals. If your goal is sticky liquidity, emission bursts don't provide that. Let's look at some examples:\n\n[Kyber](https://defillama.com/protocol/kyberswap) started their Rainmaker program in July 2021. Their TVL spiked from about $25M to $550M. A few months later when the rewards ended it settled out to around $65M. So with a spike of $525 million, they managed to retain $40M in sticky liquidity. A 90% drop off is pretty typical.\n\nNext consider [Alchemix](https://defillama.com/protocol/alchemix). Technically their emissions didn't \"end\" suddenly they just inflated their token value and therefore the reward value towards zero. You can see the long term effect this had on their TVL quite clearly if you just overlay the emission rate * ALCX price on their TVL. For some quick numbers their TVL peak was about $900M and at the start of the year they were around $50M. Again, a 90% drop isn't unusual.\n\nIn summary, the type of capital that emission bursts attract are highly reactive to rate changes (kind of obvious right?). Liquidity farming in the form of an emission burst is basically a marketing expense that obliterates your token price. So, if you want sticky capital from those players you're going to want sticky incentives like Curve is offering. Are sticky incentives what gives liquidity farming its value? In the case of Curve, for their objectives, yes. But how do you do that without destroying your token value? How does CRV manage to protect their token price where ALCX does not? The TLDR for Curve is they offset their emissions with bribes (20-30%), have non-discretionary buybacks and locks for protocols like Yearn and Convex, and take 50% of their pool fees as protocol revenue (they have a lot of volume). All these combine to minimize the impact on price of CRV issuance. At the same time Curve is purchased for it's utility to DAOs. It's hard to explain succinctly but if you're curious [dive in](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/evolutions-in-liquidity-sourcing).\n\nIs there value to liquidity farming if you don't have sticky incentives? In a few smaller ways, yes. Why did that 10% of capital stick around in the case of Kyber? Did they just try a protocol and like it? There may be some truth to that but I'd argue it's less that and more that a large TVL burst changes the [protocol trust equation](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/monetizing-honesty). The trust earned from a large TVL spike without a hack doesn't go away when the mercenary capital does. So you can think of these high emissions at the start of a protocol as a trust bootstrapper. They compensate initial risk takers with higher rates in something like an inverse insurance scheme. There is value in this, at least until someone cracks actual Defi insurance, so I expect it to be fairly common even in the long term.\n\nThe other value to liquidity farming is of course fundraising. This is an incredible magic trick. How do you make money by giving something away? Well, you make a large portion of the giveaway conditional on providing liquidity and then you dump your personal tokens into LPers. This is so evil I would never have thought of it alone but it's so commonplace now we take it for granted. If you try to explain this mechanism to someone outside our ecosystem they'll look at you like \"how can you believe this shit\"? Nevertheless, I made a killing farming/dumping food coins once upon a time (Yam's anyone?).\n\nOnce we got familiar with the mechanics liquidity farming speculative tokens became a new type of casino. If ICOs were Shitcoin Roulette, liquidity farming was closer to slots. You *know* the price is going to drop but you gamble that you can make up the price drop on fresh issuance. I think both of these mechanisms enabled some serious speculative investing and were a major component in driving the bull runs of 2017 and 2021. I frankly look forward to what wizardry the ecosystem is going to deliver in 2025 to drive the next speculative investing wave.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A topic I&#39;ve been asked about a few times is whether liquidity farming is a fad or whether there is any actual value there?

To clarify I think the points you\u2019ve made around Curve and liquidity-mining\u2019s effects on the price of tokens are good, but the effects you mention on TVL are much more nuanced, and vary on a per protocol basis.\n\nIf you take Alchemix for example, I don\u2019t think liquidity mining has had the effect on TVL you mention. Alchemix has historically used liquidity-mining to incentivize LPs on alAsset pools. If there\u2019s not enough liquidity there then the product has a ceiling on how much it can scale, but that might not come into play if the product doesn\u2019t have the demand to hit that ceiling in the first place.\n\nBack in the days of DeFi summer yields were high all across DeFi (because of liquidity mining everywhere), so you saw underlying vault yields on DAI in excess of 20%, which made Alchemix very appealing since the loans would pay themselves off so quickly. Vault yields dropping in the bear market fundamentally changed demand on those vaults, which is what contributed most of the  TVL decrease imo.\n\nIf you look at Alchemix vault utilization in the current environent the stable vaults don\u2019t have much demand at all, but the ETH vaults are nearly max-utilized at all times because staking yields are higher. If you consider that most people are bullish on price appreciation of ETH relative to the dollar on longer timeframes, aggregated yield over time in dollar terms could be a lot larger than the stake rate percentage suggests. Establishing a credit line on this kind of collateral, that pays itself off, is just way more useful. Especially if you can tie in automated subscriptions to things like ENS. For this latter case (ETH vaults) the scaling factor influenced by emissions *does* impact TVL. For the stable vaults I would say it has virtually no bearing on TVL.\n\nThis might seem nitpicky, but I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that liquidity-mining only has the effect you mention on TVL if TVL is what\u2019s being incentivized, which is not always the case. I would also say that \u201cstickiness\u201d of TVL has as much to do with demand to use the product as it does trust factor.\n\nMoving on to your points on whether or not liquidity mining is worth it for protocols: If there\u2019s one thing the last cycle has proven, it\u2019s that liquidity is a commodity in DeFi, and one that protocols are willing to pay for. Every project needs some liquidity for their protocol token, but any protocol who\u2019s product relies on synthetic assets needs a lot more of it. Curve and Balancer are basically selling liquidity mining as a service, and in doing so allow protocols to curb sell pressure on their own tokens, but still benefit from the bootstrapping/scaling effects of liquidity-mining. Alchemix has been taking advantage of this for a while now, gaining in these liquidity-driving assets over time and greatly reducing emissions of ALCX.\n\nFor Curve and Balancer liquidity-mining seems worth it because the demand for the product they sell, in conjunction with contracting supply, potentially outweighs the cost. The game for assets like CRV and BAL is that hopefully enough of the supply is locked up, either through retail lockers to earn bribes, or by protocols through bulk purchases, that the revenue can potentially offset selling of *new* emissions, without having to worry as much about the previous ones. So you\u2019re betting on growth of the AMM, how the protocols can extract the most value out of their LPs on behalf of token holders, and the degree to which token holders are willing to lock. So far this had held up well for the top tier AMMs, but the timeframe is still smallish in the grand scheme of things. \n\nProtocols that want to make use of incentives outside of AMMs, like incentivizing depositors, won\u2019t be able to make use of these these liquidity-mining as a service products, and may opt to use their own liquidity mining because it\u2019s still too valuable as a bootstrapping mechanism. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going away, but I do think that defaulting to \u201cve\u201d won\u2019t work for everything.

In the sense that defi saver provides the smart contract logic and frontend needed to see, access and interact with everything - but any transactions and management actions are executed by you, just as with any other frontend for any of these protocols.\n\nIt's all fully non-custodial, not sure if I sounded confusing in that regard. \n\nThe only time when defi saver can do something for you is specifically when you enable (for example) automated liquidation protection for your Aave position, but even this is both non-custodial and limited *(onchain!)* to doing only what you configure it to and only when the conditions that you configure are met.\n\nSo, for example, you can configure \"if my Aave position drops below 120% on the ratio, unwind it so that it goes back up to 150%\" and then if ETH (or whichever asset used as collateral) drops enough that your ratio goes below 120%, then the system would kick in to unwind a part of your position to get it back to 150%.\n\nThese automation services are something we've been providing for years in the defi space - we've had some \"first-gen\" options for MakerDAO available as early as 2019, actually.\n\nBut you don't have to use automation at all if you're using defi saver managing any positions. Automation is like another, completely optional layer that you may consider or just ignore, fully up to you.\n\n**tl:dr:** No, the app (or us as the team behind it) does not have any kind of access to your positions.\n\nAgain, if I can clarify this or anything else better - shoot away.

In the sense that defi saver provides the smart contract logic and frontend needed to see, access and interact with everything - but any transactions and management actions are executed by you, just as with any other frontend for any of these protocols.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s all fully non-custodial, not sure if I sounded confusing in that regard. </p>\n\n<p>The only time when defi saver can do something for you is specifically when you enable (for example) automated liquidation protection for your Aave position, but even this is both non-custodial and limited <em>(onchain!)</em> to doing only what you configure it to and only when the conditions that you configure are met.</p>\n\n<p>So, for example, you can configure &quot;if my Aave position drops below 120% on the ratio, unwind it so that it goes back up to 150%&quot; and then if ETH (or whichever asset used as collateral) drops enough that your ratio goes below 120%, then the system would kick in to unwind a part of your position to get it back to 150%.</p>\n\n<p>These automation services are something we&#39;ve been providing for years in the defi space - we&#39;ve had some &quot;first-gen&quot; options for MakerDAO available as early as 2019, actually.</p>\n\n<p>But you don&#39;t have to use automation at all if you&#39;re using defi saver managing any positions. Automation is like another, completely optional layer that you may consider or just ignore, fully up to you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>tl:dr:</strong> No, the app (or us as the team behind it) does not have any kind of access to your positions.</p>\n\n<p>Again, if I can clarify this or anything else better - shoot away. Seems I haven&#39;t worded things perfectly well initially.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-23 09:54:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jheueqn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12vwbun","parent_id":"t1_jhes302","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-23 10:08:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jhewcrz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12vwbun","parent_id":"t1_jheueqn","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nikola_j","body":"No, it's not really signature related at all.\n\nThe smart wallet (or dsproxy, its more technical name) has the feature to provide different 'authorities' to other accounts or smart contracts, where that then allows those entities to execute the transaction for which the authority has been given.\n\nThis means that any automated transactions that you set up would not be sent out by your account - they would actually be sent out by defi saver bots, once your configured trigger condition was met.\n\nIf you're interested in how that actually looks (i.e. in terms of actual transactions) you can open up some labelled as \"automatically\" executed here: [https://stats.defisaver.com/](https://stats.defisaver.com/)\n\nGuessing that wouldn't be much use, though, so I think this intro to how 'defi saver automated strategies' work would be much more useful: [https://blog.defisaver.com/automated-strategies-technical-overview/](https://blog.defisaver.com/automated-strategies-technical-overview/)\n\nIn terms of your second question - I'm not sure I follow 100%, but in short I'd say the answer is no :D\n\nUsing defi saver doesn't give you access to different rules or rates within the protocol, it's just a set of different options and features on top of the selected protocol.\n\nSo, for example, in terms of your Aave position's liquidation point - you could set up DFS automated liquidation protection only at a threshold above that liquidation point.
