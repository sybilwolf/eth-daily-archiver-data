Both of the major bull runs we've had in this space since I've been following it have been accompanied by a new process of capital formation. In 2017 it was ICOs. ICOs are structurally a terrible idea for many reasons but the less talked about point is that most of the tokens in 2017 were structured as these weird *utility tokens*. They wanted to sell you the equivalent of poker chips you could cash in for some purpose in their system. Even at the time these designs struck me as a poor fit for their domains but I didn't understand the hidden purpose of these designs until I read The Infinite Machine by Camila Russo.\n\nThe design intention of a utility token is to fundraise using a commodity rather than a security. ETH pioneered this claim legally. There were multiple chapters in the book on how the Ethereum founders consulted with lawyers, carefully worded their ICO to do everything possible to make ETH a commodity, and ultimately appeared to get away with it. A few years later when there was no legal action against the Ethereum founders some copycats like Request Network, Golem, and Augur followed their pattern and raised stupid amounts of money with nothing more than a whitepaper. Following the initial success of these pioneers came a tidal wave of grifters and ultimately a massive bull run. ICOs made it so you could raise funds without KYC. Utility tokens made it that you weren't selling a security (at the time).\n\nThe next several years were a bumpy ride while we waited for the promises of all those ICOs to mature. It took years to get things we consider simple today like Maker, Compound, and Uniswap. We drifted up to $400 rather quietly. Then something funky happened where Compound launched a token that was given out to its users. Prior to this the only time I had heard of token distribution in this way had been Synthetix and that came with... other issues. After adding in the token rewards Compound users could actually turn a profit borrowing money from the protocol and lending it back to it. Naturally this led to a massive explosion in TVL.\n\nJust like with ICOs I think there was a hidden purpose to this pattern of distribution. Yes, it was encouraging people to try a protocol but it was *also* giving away a token and very deliberately **not selling it**. If all you're doing is giving away a token and not directly selling it to investors then it's hard to claim you're *selling* unregistered securities, right? As is often the case in Defi, once we had a pioneer it only took a short time for another to follow (Yearn). In this case though, they followed with bravado and fireworks. They cranked the rewards up to 11, pushed the APY up to 1000%, and forced a large portion of those receiving the token to provide liquidity for that token. This enabled them to use this give not sell pattern while simultaneously raising funds.\n\nWithin a few weeks of this evolution on the OG liquidity farms we saw the familiar wave of grifters appear in their wake. Food coins seemed to appear every day with nothing more than a whitepaper (sometimes only a page or two of technobabble). I saw money being raised for everything from currency that burns itself as it moves (Pasta), to pseudo-abductionary something or other (Seed), to commercial real estate (Pylon). Not one of these things had a chance at being successful and not a cash-grab. Nonetheless they were able to bootstrap multiple millions of dollars seemingly out of thin air. Making money by giving something away remains one of the most impressive magic tricks I've seen in this space to date.\n\nIn both cases there appears to have been so much demand for peer to peer capital formation that even outright scams were able to raise tens of millions of dollars. Why is this? There are only two major differences with Defi compared to traditional capital formation via angel investors and seed rounds. First, the burden of SEC compliance was removed. This removes bureaucratic red tape and enables expediency on behalf of the issuer. Second, you could fundraise from a permissionless audience. This expands access to previously inaccessible capital. The evidence indicates that either the red tape imposed by the SEC is so burdensome it has been holding back global capital formation for decades or that friction on capital flows using US dollars was so bad that a large amount of innovation was stifled because it couldn't be paired with investment vehicles. Either way, this is the actual cost of the SECs \"protection\".\n\nIn my ideal world registering a security would an optional process issuers could go through to be certified and expand their investment pool to funds that only include SEC certified securities. This would render whether something is a security or not a mostly irrelevant question. Everyone would be able to voluntarily opt in to this system without coercion. I'm aware scams would proliferate (just like they did with ICOs and Food coins) but outright fraud is still illegal. This will never happen voluntarily though.

Basically, just what we saw with ICOs and tokens. The Great Depression was sparked by the bursting of the massive stock market bubble of the Roaring 1920s.\n\nThe burden of regulation tempered all of that. In a sense, the US gave up unfettered capital formation in exchange for (hopefully) a lower risk of bubbles, busts, and fortunes lost. [Significant financial regulation was enacted as a result of the Great Depression.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities_law_history) So you have much higher barriers now, and small companies have to raise money largely from accredited investors instead of the general public (though the public's funds do reach private startups through venture capital investments). [(They can also have up to 35 non-accredited, i.e. retail, investors under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D.)](https://carofin.com/knowledge-base/security/what-securities-laws-and-regulations-govern-private-placements/)\n\nI see speculation as almost a natural human instinct, driven further by price inflation. Money is drawn to where it can make more money even if it's just betting on the equivalent of coinflips. Stock markets harness that drive for the societally useful purpose of forming capital for productive companies. Securities divisions and brokers are huge because the stock/asset market machine is simply that huge and profitable. Defi is providing competition to tradfi's machinery (extremely well-paid tradfi management and employees being labelled 'financial parasites' by some), which is well and good. It's just that if you leave this speculative activity unchecked, huge bubbles tend to form and speculators lose their pants.\n\nWhether governments should regulate securities markets depends on where each individual draws the ethical and individual rights line: should companies be allowed to raise capital from anyone at all, without those companies first being audited and required to disclose certain information? Should audits be required or should everything be caveat emptor, including for investors who know nothing about financial and fraud risks?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Nice overview of recent history.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The evidence indicates that either the red tape imposed by the SEC is so burdensome it has been holding back global capital formation for decades or that friction on capital flows using US dollars was so bad that a large amount of innovation was stifled because it couldn&#39;t be paired with investment vehicles.

The Great Depression was sparked by the bursting of the massive stock market bubble of the Roaring 1920s.</p>\n\n<p>The burden of regulation tempered all of that. In a sense, the US gave up unfettered capital formation in exchange for (hopefully) a lower risk of bubbles, busts, and fortunes lost. <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities_law_history\">Significant financial regulation was enacted as a result of the Great Depression.</a> So you have much higher barriers now, and small companies have to raise money largely from accredited investors instead of the general public (though the public&#39;s funds do reach private startups through venture capital investments). <a href=\"https://carofin.com/knowledge-base/security/what-securities-laws-and-regulations-govern-private-placements/\">(They can also have up to 35 non-accredited, i.e. retail, investors under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D.)</a></p>\n\n<p>I see speculation as almost a natural human instinct, driven further by price inflation. Money is drawn to where it can make more money even if it&#39;s just betting on the equivalent of coinflips. Stock markets harness that drive for the societally useful purpose of forming capital for productive companies. Securities divisions and brokers are huge because the stock/asset market machine is simply that huge and profitable. Defi is providing competition to tradfi&#39;s machinery (extremely well-paid tradfi management and employees being labelled &#39;financial parasites&#39; by some), which is well and good. It&#39;s just that if you leave this speculative activity unchecked, huge bubbles tend to form and speculators lose their pants.</p>\n\n<p>Whether governments should regulate securities markets depends on where each individual draws the ethical and individual rights line: should companies be allowed to raise capital from anyone at all, without those companies first being audited and required to disclose certain information? Should audits be required or should everything be caveat emptor, including for investors who know nothing about financial and fraud risks?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-24 00:00:49","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-04-24 02:26:27","id":"jhhpjsz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12x3uzq","parent_id":"t1_jhhi54d","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Your third possibility seems to just be my original conclusion that there is a large pent up demand for peer to peer capital formation and the SEC is in the way of it.\n\nOn the spectrum of personal responsibility vs nanny state I rest firmly on the side of personal responsibility so long as the consequences of your actions are shouldered by you.

(I'll refer to this tech as AGQR for the sake of brevity.)\n\nI finally took the trouble to switch my wallets over to AGQR in the wake of the mysterious wave of wallet drainings that Twitter has been [abuzz](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1648187031468781568) about.\n\n**How do AGQR signers work?**\n\n1. Similar to dedicated hardware wallets, you create a new seed on the signer device itself. (You can also import an existing seed.) **The seed is theoretically secure because the AGQR device at no point makes a physical nor network connection in order to sign transactions.** You store a backup of the seed you created in the same way you usually would/should: always by writing it down by hand on paper, never by screenshotting/photo.\n\n2. Your private key is held on the signer device--in my case I'm using an old Android phone running the free, open source Airgap.it Vault software. (I know, it might sound risky to keep your private key on a phone, but if you're cautious enough not to trust airplane mode, you could physically shield, remove, or otherwise disable the wifi, bluetooth, and cellular radios.) In this approach, the best-practices set up procedure is something like 1) do a factory reset of the phone, 2) update it to latest firmware 2) load the signer software either via wifi/cell or via .apk file on a usb drive connected to the phone 3) disconnect/disable/unplug all physical and network connections (airplane mode) 4) open the signer software and generate seed. **The security assurance comes via following the practice of never making a physical nor network connection after this moment.** Astute observers will ask \"What about a necessary software upgrade?\" Indeed, that requires making a connection of some sort. To be maximally cautious, you would rely on your seed back up: i.e. wipe the phone, install the new software version, remove all connections, then import seed.\n\n3. On a separate, networked device (PC/laptop/tablet/other phone), wallet software such as Metamask suggests a transaction in the way we're familiar with, but when you click \"Confirm\", instead of signing the transaction itself, it displays a QR code containing the parameters of the transaction.\n\n4. You scan this code using your AGQR signer device, and then authorize signing on the device itself, using whatever security features the device has--PIN number, pattern drawing, fingerprint, etc. Again this is similar to dedicated hardware wallets, but here there is no physical connection between the two devices. (Hence the term \"air-gapped\"... which is probably a rather old security term, and makes less sense now that wireless networking is pervasive, but I digress.)\n\n5. After you authorize, your AGQR device signs the transaction data and displays it on-screen in the form of a QR code.\n\n6. You then hold the screen of the AGQR device up to a webcam attached to the networked device that first suggested the transaction, and it reads the QR code and broadcasts the signed transaction to the Ethereum network.\n\nIt might sound like a hassle but the whole process takes less than a minute when you get used to it. The key principle is that the communication between the signer device and the suggest/broadcast device is strictly limited to QR codes, meaning the attack surface is minimized, because attacking through a QR code, while theoretically possible, is about as likely as someone guessing/brute-forcing your private key. **Note that, as with any other signing method, the AGQR method offers no protection against your decision to sign malicious transactions--it simply conducts the signing process in a maximally secure way, isolating your seed/private key.**\n\n**Why not just use a hardware wallet like Trezor, Ledger, Lattice, etc?**\n\n1. Owning a hardware wallet makes it obvious that you're into crypto. For those of us who would rather keep it discrete, an old phone wins hands down. The hw wallet companies seem to really disregard this segment of the market. Case in point, the new \"fashion\" Ledger wallets that you wear on a chain around your neck. Thanks but no thanks.\n\n2. Personal information exposure risk. Buying a hardware wallet potentially creates a record of your name/address/phone number/credit card number being associated with cryptocurrency. This could be no big deal, or it could be a huge deal in the case of the Ledger customer data leak. Buying a phone creates no such risk. In fact...\n\n3. You probably already own an old phone. If not you can buy one cheaper than you can a hw wallet.\n\n4. Phones are mass-produced consumer technology. We could argue that hardware wallets have become this too, but which is easier to quickly replace, repair, or troubleshoot? Definitely the phone, in my opinion.\n\n5. No custom firmware/drivers. It seems like every few weeks there are new headaches and incompatibilities based on faulty or late firmware/drivers.\n\n**Downsides?**\n\n1. Since it's just (free) software that runs on a phone, it doesn't create any revenue for the people that make it. Therefore if there are future changes to Ethereum's transaction data format, updates to the AGQR signer software could be slow or even, worst-case, non-existent. However, the software I'm using is open source, so I wouldn't expect it to be a problem for long, if at all.\n\n2. For the same reason, the supported range of phones might not be the best. The software installed on my old Galaxy S6, but wouldn't launch properly.\n  \n2. For the same reason, customer service/support might also be bare-bones or non-existent. I haven't checked yet.\n\n3. Not many people are using it, as far as I know, so you won't be able to Google for answers as easily. But hopefully as awareness of how effective this tech is, this situation will change! Indeed, that's part of the reason I'm posting this.\n\n**Summary and Conclusion**\n\nI'm aware I'm maybe honeymooning over it, but I'm strongly tempted to say the AGQR signer is \"the way\": it has basically all the benefits of a hardware wallet and basically none of the drawbacks. It's portable, small, and self-contained, without notifying everyone that you're into crypto, and if it breaks, no big deal, you can get a new one the next day.\n\nTrying to think about it more objectively, I know some people are likely to feel that AGQR on an old phone is a bit too \"DIY\" to trust their money with it. That's understandable, but on the other hand, I figure a lot of us here already have a pretty DIY attitude if we're willing to hold our own keys in the first place.\n\nIn conclusion, I think there will always be a market for dedicated hardware wallets, as a \"no compromises\" type, maximum security, industrial-grade solution. However, for most of us, I think AGQR fits the needs of the user so much better that it's not even close. Especially if you tend to think things should be open source and self-hosted, you owe it to yourself to explore this tech.\n\nTLDR: I'm loving my AGQR setup and just wanted to let everyone here know about it.\n\nedit: just found out that blockstream uses AGQR for its [jade hardware wallet](https://blockstream.com/jade/).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey folks, just popping in to say: air-gapped QR code-based signers are vastly underrated as a crypto wallet security solution.

This pivotal \"moment\" I've been describing can last a *long goddamn time*. The Fed is a slow lumbering beast with changes made on monthly intervals that means patterns and reactions can take months to *years* to develop. So breathe.\n2. The actual timing of and reaction to the Fed hike/pause/cut dance is understood by absolutely no one outside of nine ~~ringwraiths~~ people: seven governors, the President, and the Speaker (speculation by me).

Boy was I wrong. Turns out when you have a coin that is still high in yearly inflation (ZEC has only halved once(!) and shares near identical tokenomics to Bitcoin) *and* sees limited usage- very very bad for price growth. The long term log chart against BTC and ETH looks really bad and hasn\u2019t found a bottom. Might be worth a gamble if privacy becomes a thing but ZEC has major obstacles ahead of it including an ongoing spam attack that literally makes all of their wallets unusable. \n\nSo yeah, maybe pass on ZEC.\n\nLet\u2019s see, besides that\u2026I could see a case being made for XMR and LTC but only because they have the staying power.

Boy was I wrong. Turns out when you have a coin that is still high in yearly inflation (ZEC has only halved once(!) and shares near identical tokenomics to Bitcoin) <em>and</em> sees limited usage- very very bad for price growth. The long term log chart against BTC and ETH looks really bad and hasn\u2019t found a bottom. Might be worth a gamble if privacy becomes a thing but ZEC has major obstacles ahead of it including an ongoing spam attack that literally makes all of their wallets unusable. </p>\n\n<p>So yeah, maybe pass on ZEC.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see, besides that\u2026I could see a case being made for XMR and LTC but only because they have the staying power. Again you\u2019d want to check the long term ratio chart though. </p>\n\n<p>I can see a case being made for Ethereum L2s like ARB and OP, for obvious reasons. </p>\n\n<p>I can see a case being made for the Ethereum defi blue chips- UNI, AAVE, CRV, etc- but only due to their TVLs and usage- not due to any rational tokenomics that would accrue value (at least to my knowledge). </p>\n\n<p>I can see a case being made for some meme coins because they\u2019re far more resilient than we think- Doge is the obvious example here. </p>\n\n<p>I could also see a case being made for any coins connected to liquid staking- RPL, Lido, etc. Simply because staking is crucial and these coins may be able to skim value off the top to help appreciate their prices- and/or just due to general growing demand of staking\u2026but I also feel there will be lots of other competitors coming out here in the future so who knows. </p>\n\n<p>Bit of a ramble now but hope that helps haha!!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-24 06:10:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jhijqbg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12x3uzq","parent_id":"t1_jhid24f","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/kenzi28","body":"Upvote simply because you took the effort to write your thoughts, in a bear market.\n\nCheers!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Upvote simply because you took the effort to write your thoughts, in a bear market.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-24 06:15:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jhikexh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12x3uzq","parent_id":"t1_jhijqbg","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/thomaskolaz","body":"Thanks bro , Crypto market has a high beta.
