This may sound easy for certain applications like [AlphaGo](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago) but when you get outside of game environments even very simple -sounding objectives like \"survive\" or \"optimize for profit\" can have profound and deeply troubling unintended consequences. AI is *ruthlessly* efficient at optimizing its objective function. An objective function is a mathematical function that reduces a complex state into a *single number* that is the value of that state (I'm simplifying here for brevity). This reduction, just like feature transformations for inputs, sacrifices context in order to reduce the problem to one that fits into a more limited mathematical form that can be solved by calculus. This limited form is usually insufficiently expressive to reason about complex ethics decisions.\n\nThis problem exists everywhere in humanity but it is especially visceral in AI where an engineer is asked to express it in a single expression. In more traditional organizations the values of that organization are expressed in less concrete ways such as by writing a list of corporate values (e.g. frugality at Amazon) or by hiring a C-Suite executive that personifies the values the organization wishes to express.\n\nThe value alignment problem is an example of a [Wicked Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem). Wicked in this case means impossible rather than evil. It's insidious not just because our values are so poorly understood, but because they are *complex in form, contradictory, and evolving*. If we were to try to make an organization consisting of all humans across all time you'd find it difficult to reconcile all the differences in their beliefs about ethics. Our values are different from society to society, from one generation to the next, and even amongst neighbors across political lines. Nowadays we even seem to have a hard time agreeing on objective truths, let alone subjective matters like value prioritization. In many ways it feels like we've a large step back in my lifetime.\n\n> \u201cI have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness... -Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World\n\nA major problem with the world today is that because of information age technologies our societal values are increasingly shaped by whomever controls the capital while that capital simultaneously has a natural tendency to concentrate. This is most easily observed by looking at [wealth inequality](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/tpq3bz/oc_global_wealth_inequality_in_2021_visualized_by/). If money were an intelligent agent and you looked at what it seemed to be optimizing for you'd have to conclude money *wants* to be amongst its friends. Given what I've seen of the world that seems to be its only objective function. From a Moloch perspective profit above all else is an exceptionally bad objective function but that is basically where we're at as a species and what dominates our power structures today.\n\nIt's worse than just a Moloch trap though. This objective function of corporations is *legally* enforced because the board of directors at a company have a fiduciary duty to shareholders. Fiduciaries themselves aren't the problem. It just means trusted party. The problem is who the fiduciary duty is to and therefore the objective function the fiduciaries are obligated to honor. [Here](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TradiCorporateStructure.png) is a very simplified view of the existing power dynamics in modern day corporations. All power flows from the throne and today that throne consists of shareholders. This is what the SEC is actually responsible for enshrining: a profit above all else objective function amongst the dominant power structures of our society which is driving our species towards numerous extinction possibilities.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alignment_Problem\">value alignment problem</a> in AI is the challenge of describing to a machine what the creators of that machine actually want.

In many ways it feels like we&#39;ve a large step back in my lifetime.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI have a foreboding of an America in my children&#39;s or grandchildren&#39;s time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what&#39;s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness... -Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A major problem with the world today is that because of information age technologies our societal values are increasingly shaped by whomever controls the capital while that capital simultaneously has a natural tendency to concentrate. This is most easily observed by looking at <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/tpq3bz/oc_global_wealth_inequality_in_2021_visualized_by/\">wealth inequality</a>. If money were an intelligent agent and you looked at what it seemed to be optimizing for you&#39;d have to conclude money <em>wants</em> to be amongst its friends. Given what I&#39;ve seen of the world that seems to be its only objective function. From a Moloch perspective profit above all else is an exceptionally bad objective function but that is basically where we&#39;re at as a species and what dominates our power structures today.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s worse than just a Moloch trap though. This objective function of corporations is <em>legally</em> enforced because the board of directors at a company have a fiduciary duty to shareholders. Fiduciaries themselves aren&#39;t the problem. It just means trusted party. The problem is who the fiduciary duty is to and therefore the objective function the fiduciaries are obligated to honor. <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TradiCorporateStructure.png\">Here</a> is a very simplified view of the existing power dynamics in modern day corporations. All power flows from the throne and today that throne consists of shareholders. This is what the SEC is actually responsible for enshrining: a profit above all else objective function amongst the dominant power structures of our society which is driving our species towards numerous extinction possibilities.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-24 22:31:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jhmacsp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12y8q1c","parent_id":"t3_12y8q1c","score":60,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Holy shit, Carl Sagan said that?

Using public wifi is extremely unlikely to compromise anyone's wallet, especially if they don't click through \"you may be under attack\" warnings on websites that they are trusting to give them proper crypto addresses.\n\nIf I were using public wifi to conduct a crypto transaction, I would be 100 times more worried about someone physically snatching my phone, shoulder-surfing my password, or security cameras catching my password, than any security issue with the wifi network affecting my device.\n\nWarning people about those \"dangers\" is counterproductive as it forces them to use brain cycles on something that is a non-issue. It's like warning people who are crossing the road to pay special attention to planes falling out of the sky.\n\nIf I were able to re-write that article, I would have it say \"To safely conduct crypto transactions in a public place, be aware of these four concerns\":\n\n* Shoulder surfing\n\n* Physical theft\n\n* Surveillance cameras\n\n* Certificate errors","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Those exploits are unrelated to public wifi.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming a website follows reasonably modern security standards (HSTS), then OTT intercept attacks and wallet replacement attacks require the device itself to be compromised, not only the internet connection that it&#39;s using.
