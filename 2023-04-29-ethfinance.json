For those that aren\u2019t aware DeBank is a portfolio tracker sort of like Zapper and Zerion.

In that regard it seems comparable to the other two which is good. Like the other two I mentioned, they do have certain features that differentiate themselves. Zerion and Zapper seem to focus on native integrations with particular apps. In DeBank\u2019s case they seem to focus more on providing users with native analytics around dApps and large wallets; (whales) and also seem to be focused on trying to become a social platform to establish digital identities on top of wallets. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn regards to the latter they give you the ability to mint a web3 DeBank ID to associate with your wallet, and also have a \u201chi\u201d feature, where you can message other wallets on their platform for a fee, which (it looks like) is paid directly to the person you\u2019re messaging. The size of the fee, or rate, required to send a message is determined by the quantity of messages that ID/wallet gets. Not sure how high this can go but it starts at $1. This is an interesting way to assign a monetary value to social status. As for the feature mentioned in Twitter thread I linked, (streams) this doesn\u2019t seem to be live yet, but it sounds like a social media platform (I would imagine something like Twitter) that is meant to build your digital identity; and it sounds like they\u2019re basically going to reward usage with liquidity mining (or a future airdrop) on top.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you were around for the /r/ethtrader days you probably remember the donuts drama and might be worried about low effort spam. Their post seems to suggest that higher engagement will lead to better rewards, so that\u2019s better, but this may also be able to be gamed. In the short term maybe this will be combatted by the current cap on DeBank wallet IDs. (currently they\u2019re only allowing up to 100k IDs to be minted, at a price of $97 each; and only one per wallet) I\u2019m not sure how they plan to combat this long term though. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nStill, this potential approach of liquidity mining on top of a new social media platform (if that is indeed what it is) is interesting to me, because in an ideal case where its not gamed by a majority I actually could envision this working well at bootstrapping. Unlike DeFi, where liquidity is mercenary and users are always chasing the best rates, people tend to stick around on social platforms they enjoy using. All it takes is a few content creators or communities to adopt it for attention to be sticky for that userbase. Social capital gains (follower counts etc.) also provide another incentive to create \u201cstickiness\u201d. Not to mention, crypto influencers, moreso than other influencers, seem to be much more likely to gain followings based on their percieved wealth, or ability to gain wealth, so I could imagine success in a platform that ties wallets to social profiles.
