In that world there is no real reason why ETH price should be high. Ethereum could be succesful without big value accrual to ETH.</p>\n\n<p>My bull case as discussed <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/wtr2q4/daily_general_discussion_august_21_2022/il5w9cm/\">here</a> is that hopefully L1 will keep being used because of the prestige-effects attached to it, kind of like a luxury chain. It is not needed to pay that much, but it gives greater prestige and legitimacy to projects that seek it, such as hopefully NFTs and memecoins.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m hoping that of course for [mybags] sake and because I like to jerk to the burn, but furthermore a strong ETH is a strong basis for Defi because it is the best collateral. The more value accrual to ETH, the more potential for Defi to really flourish imo. It really seems the best scenario to have high fees on mainnet so we have high total revenue for Ethereum, and extremely low fees on L2s and L3s through immense scaling </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Again I have to spend 50$ for a swap, how do you wanna cater to the whole world&quot;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t really care for this critique, because the whole world will be able to transact and trade whichever asset they want very cheaply. Only those people that want to trade memecoins and NFTs on mainnet will have to pay that price, but they are willing to do that anyway</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-03 02:48:25","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-05-03 02:54:59","id":"jioeigs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_136avsi","parent_id":"t1_jio9zyj","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"I think we both agree on the *long term plan/ result*, but disagree with regards to how it plays out short term.

That is to say they are likely to get even more prominent and noticeable over time. Whether it's an image macro, copy pasta or a token, memes spread whether we like it or not. The explosion of web2 apps made the former types spread even faster than ever, as it became trivial for anyone to make and disseminate them. Likewise, the explosion of web3 apps and the internet of value make it easier and easier for memes with value ascribed to them to spread.

And the reasons regulation is a hot button topic now more than ever is from shit like FTX, LUNA, Blockfi, Celsius, etc. Without those events, congressmen wouldnt necessarily be shouting from the hill tops. We'd see some discussions, but not mountain moving headlines. \n\nAgain, in the US, for government, its all about everyday folks. And too many regular people have real money tied up into crypto. We are all that person. \n\nHere is another reality, crypto may be becoming less volatile now more than ever but these markets are still easily manipulated. Not saying thats a good or bad thing, its just a reality. But with that reality, comes opportunity. I believe the latest developments with Ethereum (merge/pos, eip-1559, shapella, etc) has leveled the playing field a bit, making it more difficult for the price of ETH to just tank from manipulation. A constant state of deflation allows for the price to have a lighter plight. \n\nMass adoption doesn't have to happen! Would be great, and yeah, I think it'll probably happen whether ppl know it or not (i.e. credit card settlement layer) .. but again, doesn't have to happen for Ethereum to have a new ATH or even go to 20k per eth or more. Look at the market cap of gold. 13.4 Trillion? all of crypto teeters on a tenth of that. I believe Ethereum will have its own trillion dollar MC and in some sort of short order. Too much innovation for it to not have that sort of evaluation, and we're only a few years into new frontiers like Defi. There will be more frequent and bigger waves of new ways of more and more capital coming into this space. \n\nStick to the fundamentals of investing if youre stressin; Have a job that pays your bills, have a nest egg that covers you for 5-6 months if you lose said job, and everything else should DCA into the investments you believe in. In this case, ETH is still a winner here. You'll get to lower your DCA price for eth, you'll have more ETH and you'll benefit from the high probability that ETH will find a new ATH within a few years. \n\nBy the way, when my uninformed family and friends asks me what I think about the price of ETH right now, I say the same thing over and over. I say, I won't be phased by any price action until US inflation is at or around 2%. -- and I think that'll happen within a few years.

But experience either shapes you or it breaks you and we have seen a number of people sell when they had that doubt and scramble to get back in or miss the boat entirely and we have seen people just buckle in despite their doubts...maintain the courage of their convictions and be rewarded heavily for it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t let the doubt make me do something stupid and now these bear markets are simply boring and annoying.  I don&#39;t really worry anymore about my investment.  Couple more cycles and you&#39;ll be feeling like a pro.

Of course, the magnitude of the last peak was of course a lot lesser than most of us expected.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are tied to the same overall crypto market cycles, so we can extend our view into the past by a bit if we include Bitcoin's historical price cycles.

It's not a good feeling.\n\n> I just dont see it.\n\nI wonder if you may have bought ETH in chase of a market trend, instead of buying it with conviction.\n\nIn investing, it's important to do your own DD and come up with your own conviction regarding an asset, then stick with that conviction through the inevitable nonsensical market cycles, good and bad. Conviction should have one critical property - that it's based entirely on the fundamental value you assign to the asset, and if there's any correlation with the current market price, it should be an inverse one.\n\nIf you truly have conviction that ETH will not see ATH again and that the Ethereum network isn't going anywhere, then there's no reason for you to hold ETH anymore. In that case, you shouldn't feel the need to FOMO later if the price starts rising again, any more than I feel any FOMO to ape into pepecoin or bet my money on black at the casino - you can label ETH as zero-sum trash and move on from it. Don't let the sunk cost fallacy emotionally bully you into continuing to hold it. You can chalk up your loss as emotional growth, as a lesson not to gamble in assets that you believe have no fundamental value.\n\nJust as people who are staunchly pro-Ethereum make money in investing, people who are staunchly anti-crypto also make money in investing (in meme stocks like TSLA and boomer stuff like SPY). It's the flip-floppers that the market tries to juice like a grapefruit, and market participants can prevent this kind of bleeding by developing conviction - either the positive conviction that drives one to hold ETH into the ground, or the negative conviction that drives one to never touch ETH even when tempted with overwhelming FOMO.\n\nI wish that you are able to find your conviction on ETH. Negative or positive, your conviction should stay the same through multiple market cycles - as long as the (good or bad in your opinion) fundamentals of ETH remain unchanged.\n\nIf your conviction is negative, then at the point of the next crypto market cycle, I hope you are able to feel secure in your tradfi investments and not be tempted by a bunch of internet gamblers pumping up an ETH that has no fundamental value in your opinion. If your conviction is positive, then I hope at the point of the next crypto market cycle, you have decided you will hold ETH into the ground and not be tempted to sell at bargain prices to Wall Street bankers an ETH that has lots of fundamental value in your opinion.\n\nRemember: bulls make money, bears make money, grapefruits get the juicer.
