They were not really popular, maybe because my thoughts were not well structured, maybe because I am wrong, I don't know. I still want to try one more time because I think the topic is important, at least for me, even if there is nothing that can be done about it (which is likely the reason why people call it \"fud\", which is not - obviously - not my attention).\n\n\"High fees are good.\" And \"High fees are not good.\" I don't think these two statements are contradictory. Why? Context.\n\nGenerally speaking and long term high fees are good. They are the result of demand for scarce block space provided by mainnet Ethereum.\n\nShort term high fees are potentially not good, because they have potentially (!) negative consequences that harm the Ethereum ecosystem in the long run.\n\nLet me try to explain: I think there are two results of high fees. High fees make mainnet basically unusable for users with less than 10k (?).\n\n1. Now people will say \"well, but L2s are here\" and rightfully so! I have most of my funds on L2s already despite the centralization. The same applies to a lot people that regularly visit this sub.But will a new user that onboards now understand what L2s are and how to use them? I think there are sadly still a lot of UX dimensions that lead to a strategic disadvantage of L2s in comparison with alt L1s like Solana or new contenders like Aptos, Sui et. al.Let's assume that most of new users will start on a CEX before going onchain. If they own ETH, there first withdrawal choice on most CEXes will be mainnet. (Funnily on Binance it's probably still BSC. Why would Binance make this the default if it didn't work and leads to ETH flows to BNB?) So there is at least one additional step.Afterwards users need to add their specific L2 to red fox wallet, because at least some time ago, ARB or zksync were not by default part of the networks in MM. This is a second step and I think it's fair to say it's a scary one.There are probably more things, but let's just take these two more a moment. Onboarding / user acquisition is a funnel. Experience shows that with every additional step there is user churn and it doesn't matter how small the step is. But I think these two are significant steps with the second one being a potential onboarding breaker.Or in a few words: L2s UX is worse, the funnel is longer and has more steps, there is a disadvantage (compared to alt L1s) when it comes to onboarding right now. To be honest: I don't understand how this statement is regarded as FUD or why people are fighting this. I highly welcome arguments against these two points and my conclusion, but I think this really is a fair and rather objective summary of the reality of new users these days.\n2. High fees will lead - again - to \"high fees memes\" like last cycle. And it doesn't matter if these are factually correct/ fair/ etc. It will just happen and it actually already is happening. Representatives from alt L1s will voice their concerns, CT and crypto media will spread the memes and people will read them.Let me take you back to my first buy. In 2018 I made my first buy. I bought ETH. Why? Cause it was just cheaper to transfer ETH to Binance from my local on ramp, BTC had.... high fees. I probably didn't even know that ETH would also arrive faster, maybe I did, that's of course a pro. Also ETH was good, because it had a lot of trading pairs, also pro ETH.Now obviously things have changed and these local exchanges where you convert FIAT to ETH/BTC are most irrelevant right now (see 1 -> people will most likely start on CEXes). My point is: I had no clue about crypto. But high fees scared me. I think it's a fair assumption that at least some users will have similar thoughts when they enter the crypto ecosystem.Now the community might be able to convince some new users to still try to onboard L2s, but then we still have the added complexity compared to alt L1s (see 1. again).\n\nSo basically: It's great that there are now L2s that are live, but they need to be accessible as well and they need to be regarded as equal or even superior by new users.\n\nSome rebuttal to the things people have said the last couple of days:\n\n\\- \"But Benido, ARB has more economic activity than most L1s combined\" That's completely true, but where does all this activity and TVL come from? From L1. It's users that have made money in the last cycle and that were onboarded to L1 when fees were still low and even with rather high activity fees were acceptable. ARB is not killing it because new users pick it as their home, at least not for the majority of users. It's OG hunting airdrops, then their money is sticky, cause it's farming on L2s now. But what happens if next cycle there are basically no new users that make it on L1? What happens if L2s lose the marketing war with SOL, Aptos etc.?\n\n\\- \"But Benido, it's not about the amount of users, it's about their economic power, so basically a few users with a lot of ETH are way more important than millions of users with a few dollars\" While I get that theory, I don't think it is that black and white. I understand and support ETH trying to be the center for big investors/ institutions. I don't think that ETH (both the ecosystem and the assets) will be *very* successful if \"retail\" isn't part of the ecosystem. One of the reasons is that users with a few dollars now might become decent users in terms of economic power after the cycle (because they 10-50xed their investment, which of course is not going to be the average, some will lose all, some will \"only\" 5x, but some will kill it).  And longterm I think ETH needs not just a huge market share in terms of TVL, but also in terms of number of users. And isn't that the goal of scaling anyways? To allow more people, even with lower balances, to enjoy ETH's security via L2? I think it is...\n\nSo let me try to summarize. High fees are generally good, but imo we are not in a position yet where high fees only have positive effects. Or in other words: if the goal is to onboard the first billion of users I don't think the ecosystem is there yet and if you asked me \"Would you prefer 5M ETH burned in 2023 or a better UX for the whole ecosystem than alt-L1s?\" then I would always prefer UX over fees burned, because only if UX is superior we can have it all and then high fees probably really have no or just little negative consequences.\n\nLet me add some more statements:\n\n\\- I am still bullish ETH, I haven't sold any ETH and I won't. This is not supposed to be FUD, I am just trying to voice concerns about the state of the ecosystem making assumptions and trying to predict what *could* happen.\n\n\\- I am obviously not 100% sure it will play out like this. E.g. Maybe my assumptions are wrong and user churn is way lower than expected despite the additional steps. Maybe L2s will explode in terms of TVL *and* amount of users.\n\n\\- I am voicing my concerns because I think we need to improve UX so much more. Basically this post is a call to action for all builders to focus on UX.\n\nAnd again: don't get me wrong, I love (!) ETH and I love L2s and my money is where my mouth is. This is *not* about me. It is about new users that have less insights, experience, knowledge about the beauty of the ecosystem. And I will die on this hill.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have made seveal posts and comments with regards to high fees in the last couple of days.

The mix of messages that Ethereum is for world peace and for getting rich is grade-A fuel for a reader&#39;s bullshit detector. I would personally get rid of all the &quot;investment angle&quot; messaging.
