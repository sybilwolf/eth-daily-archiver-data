TLDR my opinion at the time was good project, bad token. Since then the price has fallen from $312 to $18 and the ETH ratio has fallen from .155 to .01. There's no way to sugarcoat that. It hurts to see a good project getting hammered by 2020 era tokenomic designs but the price chart we see for ALCX is pretty typical of these inflationary incentive design tokens.\n\nOn the implementation side, everything has been going great. The project has launched a v2, launched on multiple chains, is always or nearly always full for any vault you want to use, and has some of the most professional liquidity management of any project I've seen (right up there with Frax which inspired their Elixir design). The reason I think people are asking me recently is because Alchemix has had a governance+tokenomic overhaul going through audit that is probably going to land any week now. So, if I didn't think the project was a good buy at 15x the ETH ratio today, are those tokenomic updates sufficient to change my opinion?\n\nBefore we talk about upcoming changes we need to review some of the fundamentals here. First, why does Alchemix have a vault TVL limit? Wouldn't more TVL usually be a good thing? Why cap it? Well, the usual flow of a vault user is to deposit assets, then mint alAssets, then sell them. That's why they are taking a loan after all. Selling the alAsset is the *expected* use case. So, more users = more sell pressure. This wrecks the price of the alAsset (which is bad). So the TVL of vaults is limited in order to protect the alAsset peg. This means the **protocol growth** is being systemically gated.\n\nNext, where is the potential profit that ALCX could extract? Without profits there is no dividend, no buyback, little fundamental token value besides \"governance\" over yet another profitless system. I'm not a buyer of those systems (sorry Uniswap). There is a little bit of profit in kickbacks from Yearn on certain vaults that actually deposit to Yearn but the lion's share of the potential profit is from users forfeiting the interest on their interest bearing assets. This is explained further in my old [transmuter](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/alchemix-transmuter-boost/) post. TLDR, the debt you are forgiven via your self-repaying loan goes to the protocol as profit. There are excellent stats on their harvests available [here](https://alchemix-stats.com/) and [here](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/user-docs/financial-reports). I don't even need to do calculation here, they are making about $3M a year in protocol profit. Let's say 10% of that goes to the DAO treasury. That gives you a treasury profit of about $300k. So if inflation was 0 (it still isn't) you'd have a justified market cap of about $60M (standard PE 20 assumption). There's currently a market cap of about $33.5M and treasury assets (excluding ALCX) of about $16M. So things look *ok* until you add in inflation and other expenses. Then you shed about $450k in salaries and quickly are in debt from issuance ($3.4M in issuance in the next 12 months). Overall still not a buy at these prices with the system as it is today.\n\nBut how does this system grow? Is there any hope on the horizon? What is changing with their governance revamp? Fundamentally, their biggest headwind is their limited ability to protect the alAsset peg while growing quickly enough. It's not for a lack of product market fit, they literally have too many customers banging at the gates to fit them all in the vault capacity. Let's explore this a bit further. Let's take ALCX inflation and Curve incentives entirely out of the picture for a moment. How does a *sustainable* version of this protocol work? Today the Elixir system has about $68M TVL. Those are LP positions owned by the protocol on places like Curve. Let's use that number for some napkin math. How much TVL can you support with 68M of protocol owned liquidity? Well, that depends on how strongly you want to defend the peg. For the sake of argument let's say that on some Curve pool there is a 3:1 alAsset/asset ratio at a .97 ratio due to liquidity compression. In that case, their 68M consists of about 17M of underlying. The other 51M is the alAsset they can support. It is literally being held in Curve by the Elixir system and requires no yield. At a 1:2 loan-to-value ratio that means they can support 102M of TVL. If the underlying is earning 3% yield that means they are earning about $3.06M in underlying asset protocol profit. This profit would allow them to expand the alAsset market cap by $9M and in turn that means they can expand the TVL by 18M. These numbers are in the ballpark of reality and show the potential for a ~15-25% YoY TVL growth *before* we utilize the treasury assets to buy commoditized liquidity. The real issue for ALCX as a low-cap token is the system can expand geometrically but not exponentially. A 25% YoY growth rate does not make for a moonshot. That might be fine if they were already huge like Microsoft but it's not great compared to other high-risk low-cap coins they are competing against. The key to make it work at those numbers is to make the project and therefore token a lower risk hold.

TLDR my opinion at the time was good project, bad token. Since then the price has fallen from $312 to $18 and the ETH ratio has fallen from .155 to .01. There&#39;s no way to sugarcoat that. It hurts to see a good project getting hammered by 2020 era tokenomic designs but the price chart we see for ALCX is pretty typical of these inflationary incentive design tokens.</p>\n\n<p>On the implementation side, everything has been going great. The project has launched a v2, launched on multiple chains, is always or nearly always full for any vault you want to use, and has some of the most professional liquidity management of any project I&#39;ve seen (right up there with Frax which inspired their Elixir design). The reason I think people are asking me recently is because Alchemix has had a governance+tokenomic overhaul going through audit that is probably going to land any week now. So, if I didn&#39;t think the project was a good buy at 15x the ETH ratio today, are those tokenomic updates sufficient to change my opinion?</p>\n\n<p>Before we talk about upcoming changes we need to review some of the fundamentals here. First, why does Alchemix have a vault TVL limit? Wouldn&#39;t more TVL usually be a good thing? Why cap it? Well, the usual flow of a vault user is to deposit assets, then mint alAssets, then sell them. That&#39;s why they are taking a loan after all. Selling the alAsset is the <em>expected</em> use case. So, more users = more sell pressure. This wrecks the price of the alAsset (which is bad). So the TVL of vaults is limited in order to protect the alAsset peg. This means the <strong>protocol growth</strong> is being systemically gated.</p>\n\n<p>Next, where is the potential profit that ALCX could extract? Without profits there is no dividend, no buyback, little fundamental token value besides &quot;governance&quot; over yet another profitless system. I&#39;m not a buyer of those systems (sorry Uniswap). There is a little bit of profit in kickbacks from Yearn on certain vaults that actually deposit to Yearn but the lion&#39;s share of the potential profit is from users forfeiting the interest on their interest bearing assets. This is explained further in my old <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/alchemix-transmuter-boost/\">transmuter</a> post. TLDR, the debt you are forgiven via your self-repaying loan goes to the protocol as profit. There are excellent stats on their harvests available <a href=\"https://alchemix-stats.com/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/user-docs/financial-reports\">here</a>. I don&#39;t even need to do calculation here, they are making about $3M a year in protocol profit. Let&#39;s say 10% of that goes to the DAO treasury. That gives you a treasury profit of about $300k. So if inflation was 0 (it still isn&#39;t) you&#39;d have a justified market cap of about $60M (standard PE 20 assumption). There&#39;s currently a market cap of about $33.5M and treasury assets (excluding ALCX) of about $16M. So things look <em>ok</em> until you add in inflation and other expenses. Then you shed about $450k in salaries and quickly are in debt from issuance ($3.4M in issuance in the next 12 months). Overall still not a buy at these prices with the system as it is today.</p>\n\n<p>But how does this system grow? Is there any hope on the horizon? What is changing with their governance revamp? Fundamentally, their biggest headwind is their limited ability to protect the alAsset peg while growing quickly enough. It&#39;s not for a lack of product market fit, they literally have too many customers banging at the gates to fit them all in the vault capacity. Let&#39;s explore this a bit further. Let&#39;s take ALCX inflation and Curve incentives entirely out of the picture for a moment. How does a <em>sustainable</em> version of this protocol work? Today the Elixir system has about $68M TVL. Those are LP positions owned by the protocol on places like Curve. Let&#39;s use that number for some napkin math. How much TVL can you support with 68M of protocol owned liquidity? Well, that depends on how strongly you want to defend the peg. For the sake of argument let&#39;s say that on some Curve pool there is a 3:1 alAsset/asset ratio at a .97 ratio due to liquidity compression. In that case, their 68M consists of about 17M of underlying. The other 51M is the alAsset they can support. It is literally being held in Curve by the Elixir system and requires no yield. At a 1:2 loan-to-value ratio that means they can support 102M of TVL. If the underlying is earning 3% yield that means they are earning about $3.06M in underlying asset protocol profit. This profit would allow them to expand the alAsset market cap by $9M and in turn that means they can expand the TVL by 18M. These numbers are in the ballpark of reality and show the potential for a ~15-25% YoY TVL growth <em>before</em> we utilize the treasury assets to buy commoditized liquidity. The real issue for ALCX as a low-cap token is the system can expand geometrically but not exponentially. A 25% YoY growth rate does not make for a moonshot. That might be fine if they were already huge like Microsoft but it&#39;s not great compared to other high-risk low-cap coins they are competing against. The key to make it work at those numbers is to make the project and therefore token a lower risk hold. The system is too small at the moment to be decentralized enough for that to be true so it still isn&#39;t a buy for me. Very little about this calculation changes due to their governance revamp.</p>\n\n<p>How can they get this number up? Per unit of protocol profit, how can you maximize the amount of alAsset you can support? One uncomfortable way is to allow the peg to slip more.

Currently veALCX is undergoing audit, but the code is done pending any findings there. The name for the early-unlock token (referred to as MANA in this post and MATERIA in Logris\u2019 above) has been finalized to be FLUX, as voted on by the community. This system is pretty nuanced, but happy to discuss further and answer any questions on it. The main difference from traditional \u201cve\u201d models is that the FLUX token will be earned by lockers and can be accumulated and used for an early unlock, burned for more voting power (meaning hopefully higher bribe revenue), or sold on the open market to others that may want to unluck early, or speculate on demand to do that in the future. I always respect your takes Logris and would also be interested to learn more about how you wish it went further.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith that out of the way let\u2019s talk Alchemix! Let\u2019s start with some of the good, which will rehash a bit of what you said:\n\n* Demand on ETH vaults has been very high. Staking yields are attractive, and after increasing caps last week they\u2019re already filled again. (I believe this happened the same day)\n* Although not the best metric, TVL comfortably exceeds the mcap of ALCX at ~57m to ~33m. Once veALCX is live and becomes a claim on revenue the protocol earns, this begins to matter a bit more as some of the protocol directly comes from TVL in vaults\n* The third thing, which I think you may have missed in the post, is that the Elixirs have not only created a faster-acting mechanism for peg-maintenance, but create a large amounts of revenue for the protocol. (See my last post on Alchemix from yesterday on AMOs for a tldr of how those work) If you go to alchemix-stats.com and check the Elixir tab you\u2019ll see that farming rewards are bringing in ~280k per month for the protocol. In part this depends on the value of farmed assets, but being that we\u2019re in a bear market I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect this to grow in a bull market. Together with treasury yields, which can also be seen on the same site, that\u2019s ~500k revenue per month that, if I\u2019m not mistaken, is not accounted for in your assessment.\n\nOn to the bad. You are absolutely correct that scaling has always been the largest challenge for Alchemix. The ETH vaults are heavily in demand and fill immediately, but there has to be liquidity to service loans, and that has a cost. We could as you mentioned allow the peg the fluctuate to a larger degree, but that arguably hurts the brand and viability of the product at any one time, which is why governance has opted to use deposit caps as a circuit breaker. A big part of what we do on the biz dev side is work to find ways to make this less costly, more efficient, and reduce incentive requirements over time. I think we\u2019ve made great progress in this regard so far. Some examples:\n\n* As you\u2019ve mentioned there\u2019s been a concerted effort to acquire liquidity-driving assets, which will reduce the need to use ALCX directly. Last I checked Alchemix is a top 5 VELO holder (top DEX on Optimism for this),   Somewhere around top 20 for AURA, and somewhere around the top 15 for CVX; the AMOs continue to help grow these stacks as well. The team utilizes things like stake DAOs liquid locker and pays attention to the best bang for buck on locking, and partners with protocols like Frax for joint incentives to save money there.\n* As you mentioned the introduction of veALCX consolidates two stakeholders that were receiving incentives (ALCX holders, and ALCX/ETH LPers) into one incentivized party. This will hopefully require less incentives thanks to yield earned from the cut of protocol revenue, and the fact that yield can be earned from BALANCER/AURA under the hood.\n* Recently a discretionary fund got approved by governance so that Biz Dev can experiment with smaller pools throughout DeFi to help in these efforts. Something new that\u2019s popped up in DeFi recently that I\u2019m particularly intrigued by are protocols such as Maverick, which allow incentivizing specific ranges of concentrated liquidity, which may be able to be used for increased efficiency on incentivized peg maintenance.\n\nOutside of that Alchemix had some other cool things coming up. To drop a bit of alpha, one is a high likelihood of an Arbitrum deployment in the relatively near future. Outside of that I\u2019m personally excited by the recent self repaying ENS product, and how that could result in future similar products around automated services in DeFi that utilize an Alchemix self-repaying credit line under the hood. I think this could form the bedrock of an attractive treasury management solution for DAOs that also have operational overhead that could benefit from automation. There are some other cool things in the works that I\u2019m probably not allowed to discuss, but I would encourage following Scoopy ( https://twitter.com/scupytrooples ) on Twitter since he likes to drop the occasional teaser post. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs an aside but related to the conversation of \u201cis X a good buy?\u201d, I\u2019m generally very picky about alt coin investments, since I basically compare everything I invest in to ETH, and ETH is pretty damn hard to beat. Imho ETH has the best risk adjusted returns in the space, and already a good chance at multiples on investment, so anything else I invest in needs to have measurably higher upside. With that said what I personally look for are assets that are (1) low cap, (2) generate yield that offsets the risk of holding, (3) tied to a product I value that I think has good growth prospects. Until veALCX is live, ALCX won\u2019t even fall into this category, but ALCX is one of only 3-4 alts I hold meaningful amounts of. I have not sold any that I\u2019ve earned from my role outside of tax lost harvesting and rebuying. Unrelated to ALCX, I would be super interested in hearing what these other low caps are that you think have better upside ;)\n\nAgain, great post and happy to discuss any of this further if you or anyone else would like.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Great post Logris, and I think a fair assessment overall.

I know some people on the team have suggested to initially set it such that 1/4th of your initially locked position could be unlocked after a year, but if you have an opinion on this I would love to hear it, and highly encourage you to make your voice heard in the Alchemix discord too.
