This will ofc greatly limit the ease of minting Ordinals, BRC20s etc. The most eye popping part is how he says this is a &quot;bugfix&quot; so it can be backdoored via a soft fork and not a hard fork. Even suggesting that is going to make a lot of people very mad lmao, because it tries to force a change on the BTC network by core devs decree, instead of giving the community the freedom to choose via mining hashrate. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It&#39;s possible BRC20s are so clunky (every sale needs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChainLinkGod/status/1655705391341375489\">minting a separate NFT for that tx</a> \ud83e\udd23) that this is a fad that dies off and the mempool clears out. But if it doesn&#39;t, and BRC20s take off, we are likely looking at the first contentious hard fork for BTC in almost 6 years I think.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-09 08:15:04","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-05-09 08:18:39","id":"jjh96hn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13cfzjx","parent_id":"t3_13cfzjx","score":48,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/VECHAIN_10_DOLLARS","body":"Interesting.
