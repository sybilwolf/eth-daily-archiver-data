Let me first state that I really liked the episode and now have a way better understanding wrt to the \"why\" its discussed, designed and seen as a (potential?) solution for Ethereum. But I still have some thoughts, comments, questions, I hope these weren't already discussed:\n\n\\- I understand that smoothing MEV is a security mechanism against reorgs because high MEV blocks are a huge incentive to reorg the chain to capture the MEV for yourself. That makes sense and is imo a good argument in favor of smoothing and potentially burning MEV. That seems like a good mechanism that improves the ecosystems security and stability. I don't understand why mainly Justin Drake talked so much about \"lottery\" and \"winners\" and \"losers\". It is a lottery. I actually stake because I wanna secure the network **and** be part of the lottery. I understand that I will most likely lose. That's why I have a some ETH in rETH and stETH as well. But that doesn't make me irrational. I understand the set up, the risks, the likely outcome and still can opt-in. I think these arguments are weak and they aren't neutral and neutrality is imo one of the beautiful values of ETH that we shouldn't lose. \n\n\\- Justin Drake again made a case with numbers in this episode. I am not sure this is a good idea. If you have been around (and listening to bankless, but not even a req) for 2-3 years you probably know about the ultrasound money episode and some google sheets with calculations that were published afterwards. Basically Justin Drake said back then \"I think we will have 20% APY including MEV for stakers after the merge when we go ultrasound\" IIRC, please correct me if I am wrong. Now first of all we all know that *at least right now* we are nowhere close to 20% APY, probably because his number were based on a bull market, maybe because the MEV landscape changed, I can't really tell. But what's imo even more important: Just 2 years later we are changing the whole calculation, because something (MEV) we thought *should* go to stakers to secure the chain now seems to be irrelevant for the chain security and also stakers aren't the number 1 priority anymore.   \nNow don't get me wrong, I am not saying Justin Drake and Domothy are wrong. Again, I think the changes seem to be reasonable after listening to their explanations and I also think that stakers are still in a very good spot, it's good the whole ecosystem benefits from MEV... But I wouldn't present a business case and concrete numbers (\"we will burn up to 500k ETH additionally\"), since maybe this might change again and creates expectations which in the end could lead to disappointed users. \n\n\\- Last but not least, a question with regards to security: Justin Drake said (not verbatim) \"we need decentralised stable coins and we need trillions in USD terms (backed by ETH)\". I fully agree with that point. But we also need to secure that value? Now if I that correctly that means if ETH is the collateral for trillions of dUSD (decentralised USD) that necessarily means that the ETH market cap is in the trillions and hence a certain percentage of staked ETH (I think 10.xM validators = 32/33M ETH were mentioned in the episode) would result in a lot of economic security... but maybe u/domotheus can explain the case for this, add a little context with regards to the timing (decades?) they were thinking about when making that case and just add a little more numbers so I can understand this better?\n\nAgain: I really enjoyed the episode, the general idea makes much more sense for me now but I would really appreciate your thoughts and best case some answer regarding security.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There were some posts about MEV burn already after the bankless podcast.
