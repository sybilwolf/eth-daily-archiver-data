In trying to wrap my head around how these work, I've found a few useful angles from which to understand BRC-20. Thought I'd share.\n\n##Back To The Basics\n\nGo back 25 or 30 years and ask someone with some knowledge of cryptography and the Internet to design a simple online digital currency token platform. They're not ready for full decentralization and effective global consensus algorithms (but their kids are gonna love it). So for now just something simple will do. They'll probably come up with something like this (and I'm certain this idea has existed for ages but haven't taken the time to find references):\n\nWe'll use public key cryptography (most likely RSA at this point). Each user will generate their own keypair. Their public key will be used to identify them, and their private key will be used to sign messages so it can be cryptographically verified that the holder of the private key has agreed to the content of the message.\n\nWe'll use a centralized server to store all the messages created and do some computation behind the scenes.\n\nSo now for the protocol. JSON isn't around yet, so this will probably use some serialized object format. Anyone can create a new token by constructing an object, signing it, and sending it to the server.\n\n* **Deploy**: Fields for ticker symbol, max supply, mint limit, and signature; server verifies the signature and stores it.\n* **Mint**: Fields for ticker symbol, mint amount, and signature; the server checks signature, whether the given ticker exists, if it hasn't reached it cap yet, and if the amount to mint is below the limit.\n* **Transfer**: Fields for ticker symbol, amount to transfer, receiving pubkey, and signature; the server checks signature, valid ticker symbol, and that the owner has enough tokens to send.\n\nPretty simple. The use of public key cryptography means you generally have control over your own coins. But the server acts as a central point of failure, is responsible for trying to prevent double spends, and can carry out a variety of attacks.\n\n**BRC-20**: These objects clearly map onto the BRC-20 protocol. The main difference being that Bitcoin is used for data availability and global consensus instead of the centralized server, a huge improvement. Ordinals enable this, allowing storage of arbitrary data in blocks whose order is determined by consensus. What Bitcoin *can't do* is the verification related to the protocol, as it lacks smart contract capabilities. So execution is outsourced off-chain to software that validates transactions, but there's no record made on-chain that a transfer was or was not successful.\n\n*tl;dr*: One lens through which to view BRC-20 is as a very simple digital currency platform in which users make cryptographic signatures of \"mint\" and \"transfer\" messages. BRC-20 is an implementation of this that uses Bitcoin's Ordinals for data availability of those messages and consensus on their ordering. Execution is necessarily outsourced off-chain.\n\n## BRC-20 via ERC-721\n\nOrdinals are NFTs on Bitcoin, right? So BRC-20 is an implementation of fungible tokens using non-fungible tokens as the platform. So couldn't we theoretically do the same on Ethereum: implement a fungible token standard using our own non-fungible ERC-721 standard?\n\nERC-721 tokens, especially the PFPs, commonly have a JSON structure that specifies that token's \"traits\". For example, [my EVMaverick](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x7ddaa898d33d7ab252ea5f89f96717c47b2fee6e/161) has the accessory \"Scar\", the lion \"OG Lion\", etc. This data is actually [stored on IPFS](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNpw6kYTQNfU7LTsbj4zrFfCN8Ck4m1reUdNE63VBiNj2/161), but could be stored on chain if gas weren't an issue.\n\nWe can implement BRC-20 on top of ERC-721 by using this same trait system to store the same information that /u/Maleficent_Plankton laid out. To deploy a token, you mint a new ERC-721 with \"traits\" specifying ticker symbol, cap, etc. To mint tokens, you mint a new NFT with the corresponding traits. To send tokens to someone else, yes, you mint a whole new NFT with Protocol, Operation, Ticker, and Amt, and transfer that NFT to your intended recipient.\n\nSince this is on Ethereum, we can improve on the design by writing a smart contract to handle the logic for execution of BRC-20 operations. This plays the same role as the central server in my previous example, or the off-chain clients processing actual BRC-20 operations. But on Ethereum, you'd mint your NFT then probably send it to the contact to officially register it and run all the appropriate logic to verify its contents, leaving an on-chain record of whether it was successful.\n\nOf course, it's silly to do all this on Ethereum when we have ERC-20. But on Bitcoin, Ordinals are the key to arbitrary data storage, so that's what they have to work with.\n\n*tl;dr*: Ordinals are a fungible token standard implemented on top of a non-fungible token standard. It's an interesting thought experiment to see how this could be done using ERC-721 as the basis. Possibly helps understand why BRC-20 works the way it does.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is really interesting.

Their public key will be used to identify them, and their private key will be used to sign messages so it can be cryptographically verified that the holder of the private key has agreed to the content of the message.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll use a centralized server to store all the messages created and do some computation behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>So now for the protocol. JSON isn&#39;t around yet, so this will probably use some serialized object format. Anyone can create a new token by constructing an object, signing it, and sending it to the server.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deploy</strong>: Fields for ticker symbol, max supply, mint limit, and signature; server verifies the signature and stores it.</li>\n<li><strong>Mint</strong>: Fields for ticker symbol, mint amount, and signature; the server checks signature, whether the given ticker exists, if it hasn&#39;t reached it cap yet, and if the amount to mint is below the limit.</li>\n<li><strong>Transfer</strong>: Fields for ticker symbol, amount to transfer, receiving pubkey, and signature; the server checks signature, valid ticker symbol, and that the owner has enough tokens to send.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Pretty simple. The use of public key cryptography means you generally have control over your own coins. But the server acts as a central point of failure, is responsible for trying to prevent double spends, and can carry out a variety of attacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BRC-20</strong>: These objects clearly map onto the BRC-20 protocol. The main difference being that Bitcoin is used for data availability and global consensus instead of the centralized server, a huge improvement. Ordinals enable this, allowing storage of arbitrary data in blocks whose order is determined by consensus. What Bitcoin <em>can&#39;t do</em> is the verification related to the protocol, as it lacks smart contract capabilities. So execution is outsourced off-chain to software that validates transactions, but there&#39;s no record made on-chain that a transfer was or was not successful.</p>\n\n<p><em>tl;dr</em>: One lens through which to view BRC-20 is as a very simple digital currency platform in which users make cryptographic signatures of &quot;mint&quot; and &quot;transfer&quot; messages. BRC-20 is an implementation of this that uses Bitcoin&#39;s Ordinals for data availability of those messages and consensus on their ordering. Execution is necessarily outsourced off-chain.</p>\n\n<h2>BRC-20 via ERC-721</h2>\n\n<p>Ordinals are NFTs on Bitcoin, right? So BRC-20 is an implementation of fungible tokens using non-fungible tokens as the platform. So couldn&#39;t we theoretically do the same on Ethereum: implement a fungible token standard using our own non-fungible ERC-721 standard?</p>\n\n<p>ERC-721 tokens, especially the PFPs, commonly have a JSON structure that specifies that token&#39;s &quot;traits&quot;. For example, <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x7ddaa898d33d7ab252ea5f89f96717c47b2fee6e/161\">my EVMaverick</a> has the accessory &quot;Scar&quot;, the lion &quot;OG Lion&quot;, etc. This data is actually <a href=\"https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNpw6kYTQNfU7LTsbj4zrFfCN8Ck4m1reUdNE63VBiNj2/161\">stored on IPFS</a>, but could be stored on chain if gas weren&#39;t an issue.</p>\n\n<p>We can implement BRC-20 on top of ERC-721 by using this same trait system to store the same information that <a href=\"/u/Maleficent_Plankton\">/u/Maleficent_Plankton</a> laid out. To deploy a token, you mint a new ERC-721 with &quot;traits&quot; specifying ticker symbol, cap, etc. To mint tokens, you mint a new NFT with the corresponding traits. To send tokens to someone else, yes, you mint a whole new NFT with Protocol, Operation, Ticker, and Amt, and transfer that NFT to your intended recipient.</p>\n\n<p>Since this is on Ethereum, we can improve on the design by writing a smart contract to handle the logic for execution of BRC-20 operations. This plays the same role as the central server in my previous example, or the off-chain clients processing actual BRC-20 operations. But on Ethereum, you&#39;d mint your NFT then probably send it to the contact to officially register it and run all the appropriate logic to verify its contents, leaving an on-chain record of whether it was successful.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it&#39;s silly to do all this on Ethereum when we have ERC-20. But on Bitcoin, Ordinals are the key to arbitrary data storage, so that&#39;s what they have to work with.</p>\n\n<p><em>tl;dr</em>: Ordinals are a fungible token standard implemented on top of a non-fungible token standard. It&#39;s an interesting thought experiment to see how this could be done using ERC-721 as the basis. Possibly helps understand why BRC-20 works the way it does.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-11 09:53:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jjremti","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13edhzt","parent_id":"t1_jjpilb7","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"**BRC-20-like tokens on Ethereum**\n\nYeah, we could totally do that.
