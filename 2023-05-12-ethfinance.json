Almost all the guest speakers had excellent ideas and explanations in the discussion. However, each person was allocated only 5 min at a time, so it was somewhat limiting. Please excuse me if some of this is a little raw. It is a 3 hr meeting and I don't have the time atm to format it correctly due to my excessive fiat mining op (work).\n\n**Intros of Committee and Guest Speakers:**\n\nMr Johnson: Must be a bipartisan effort for a promising tech/market. Conflict between securities and commodities laws. Most of the G20 countries are ahead of us. We want to be the leader in this tech/industry.\n\n\nMs Caraveo: Digital asset activity grows, but so does non-compliance. Any legislation requires increased funding of CFTC.\n\n\nMr Hill: Can this industry thrive here in the US? Many Democrats calling for common sense legislation for months (not just a partisan issue). Can't trust offshore exchanges (FTX), so we need to work on laws here for US exchanges.\u00a0\n\n\nMr McHenry: We want a collab of CFTC and SEC to make laws and close regulatory gaps to protect consumers.\n\n\n**Guest speakers**\n\n\nDurgee: I'm the only non-attorney here. Already there are conflicting laws against other existing laws for crypto from the SEC and CFTC. This is a developing tech innovation that happens to be a digital currency as well. Adoption at this stage is not a tech problem, it's a human conditioning issue. A 13 year old in their lifetime has grown up with BTC and only known a world with crypto in their life.\n\n\nMr Santori: Kraken is well established in the US and the world. Europe has more effective rules from tested principles unlike the US. Gaps in US have created litigation that doesn't protect consumers. Mandates needed to protect us: https://www.youtube.com/live/gwJ1QAwP7UE?feature=share&t=43m21s\n\n\nMr Massad: Confusion about commodity/security classification of crypto worsens the gap problem. How can we apply Howey test without this info? We need to pass a compliance law directing CFTC and SEC (or SRO; self regulating agency) to create laws and enforce them, without rewriting commodities and securities laws.\u00a0Regardless of your stance on crypto we need this framework to protect consumers.\n\n\nMr Blaugrand: If investors could have traded digital assets on an exchange that was regulated like the NY Stock exchange, FTX situation wouldn't have happened. We can use the established rules we already have and apply it to crypto with these 4 rules: https://www.youtube.com/live/gwJ1QAwP7UE?feature=share&t=58m34s\n\nMr Steil (WI): We still have no path forward for regulation, even after Gensler's meeting with Congress. Congress is ready to do the job. How do we not miss out vs overseas? W/Shoenberger: Switzerland made it very clear to define security/commodities. It gave them legal security and clarity that allowed them to proceed successfully. This framework that they provided certainly provided the legal certainty to be headquartered there and to have legal clarity around the classification instantly. W/Durgee: The rest of the world has more stability and growth in every avenue of crypto. 3x as much investments vs the US in some markets.\n\nMr Lucas: US is great because we embrace innovatio. w/Santori: G20 markets are ahead of us and are sophisticated. Kraken is expanding there, but we can't deploy the same resources here in the US due to these regulatory gaps. Lucas: what SEC rules need altering for exchanges to succeed? W/Blaugrand: SEC needs an onramp with regulation so exchanges can grow in the US. They don't because of regulatory vagueness. W/Satori: Flexibility of crypto is a perk. Broker/dealer construct can interact directly with consumers. We could limit exchanges and even close down exchanges after hours.\n\n**The negative:**\n\nLynch (Mass): Not regulatory ambiguity; it's mass non compliance with existing laws. Don't argue security vs commodities, we should instead focus on intermediaries (exchanges, lenders, and wallet users). SEC is clear, consistent, efficient, and prevails in every 140 cases. crypto industry has failed. No separate regulatory regime necessary for crypto. claimed that creating new legislation for digital assets seems \u201credundant and unnecessary\u201d given that the financial system\u2019s current securities laws have \u201csustained massive innovation in our financial system for decades.\"\n\nMr Casten: What return would I had if I invested in 12 cryptos during a time vs S&P (60% profit)? Loss 46% of investment, how is this a supposed way to close wealth inequality gap? W/Durgee: accredited vs credited access is important. Mr Casten: I'm happy to debate truth not lies. Everything stated here beginning to sound like SBF and FTX, what's the distinction? Sounds like you want to regulate crypto with the least funded organization.\n\nMr Sherman: Buttcoin mod? An ignorant person's lack of ability to learn anything new. Fossil garbage opinion. Uses term \"crypto bro\". questioned whether digital assets should even have a future in the United States. He referred to cryptocurrencies as a \u201chidden money system that diverts capital investment from useful industries, and whose announced purpose is to defeat sanctions and tax laws. \nCrypto bros make money literally by making money, and they\u2019ve made over a trillion dollars. They\u2019ll accuse the U.S. government of making money out of thin air. Maybe we do, but we\u2019re the U.S. government.\"\n\n\n**Threaten Web3 Anonymity:**\n\nMr Davidson (Chairman Housing subcommittee): Gensler's hotel California's regulation provides no path to exit/leave. Who should have the power of exit from intermediaries (power to have self custody)? w/Santori: Who is best placed to collect KYC info? Kraken is well paced to do that and doesn't require KYC for every transaction, but we could do that if required.\n\nDr Foster (IL): Estimates of 95% trades are fake or wash trades in derivatives. How can we have a regulated futures market with this fraud and manipulation? What alternative to KYC at all levels is there to avoid fraud? W/Satori: Kraken provides this as a portal. Foster: we can't stop BTC on the dark web with that. At a wallet level we must have mandatory monitoring with licensing like automobiles. Trusted digital identity from the government. W/Kulkin: CFTC had auth it could conduct surveillance under the rules and jurisdiction of the exchange thereby acting as an SRO in addition to the CFTC/NFA. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nMcHenry: Even if there is nothing of value in crypto, you would still need enforceable rights and protections already found in regulations and laws in the US.  Must come together in bipartisan manner to protect investors. \n\n5 days for additional legislation questions and responses granted from the panel. Plans for another hearing this month made. \n\nLast month, McHenry said he expects that the President will have signed some piece of crypto legislation into law within the next 12 months.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><h2>Summary/Highlight of US House of Reps session: Future of Digital Assets.</h2>\n\n<p>Pleasantly surprised by most of what was discussed.
