You should probably start with getting the node functional before worrying about configuring remote access using wireguard or other means.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-15 17:26:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jkb06tm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13hy6ue","parent_id":"t1_jk9sgks","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Moschus11","body":"It is a stand-alone house in the suburbs, the house belongs to us + extended family.
