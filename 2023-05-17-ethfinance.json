These are cryptographically protected and although they introduce some security trade-offs they can be considered generally secure for most intents and purposes and it's just a matter of deciding if you would like to partake in these trade-offs.\n\nThe reckoning many people are having is that most of us (including myself) believed that extracting the private key from the secure enclave was impossible modulo highly sophisticated physical attacks (i.e. clean room, oscilloscopes and zero day vulnerabilities...). And that this was an inherent property of the secure enclave due to its design and construction. What Ledger just did is putting into light that it was perhaps always possible to extract the private key through a firmware update? In the sense that, if you are able to extract an encrypted form of the key, why not the key itself? In more concrete terms, if I make through a firmware update the encryption function used for the export the identity, I export the private key. Normally this was not possible because the firmware didn't allow it and firmware's are cryptographically signed by Ledger, so any tampering by a third party was identifiable. But as the firmware is closed source, all the trust assumptions fell back on trusting Ledger.\n\nWhat is interesting is that most likely the attack surface has not changed. We needed to trust the firmwares produced by Ledger to do the right thing and we still do.\n\nSo the key thing that needs to be answered is, are secure enclaves physically secure irrespective of firmware? In my naivety I thought so, but the more I think about it the more unlikely this seems to be. So the answer to all this affair is to demand open source and audited firmwares and vote as consumers with our choices by picking products that align with this principle. Because it's likely any other product that has closed source firmware falls down to the same trust assumptions.\n\nWhy did Ledger take such a misstep? One possible explanation is that from a technical standpoint, nothing has changed. From their perspective, if they implement a sound firmware that does not allow to extract the private key it's as secure as it was before. And on top of it they are offering a service that provides value to a subset of its consumer base, plus nice revenue model. They see only positives. They may have thought that as the trust assumptions have not changed it's all good. What they may have not considered is that its consumer base may have not fully appreciated the trust assumption they were taking and that they do not inherently trust Ledger. And this update is serving as a reckoning.\n\n**TL;DR: We must demand open source and audited firmwares. If we manage to push in this direction after this event we may have gained something positive from all this affair. If Ledger makes its firmware open source and gets it audited by reputable firms, the Shamir private key back-up service may make sense for a subset of its consumers and it could even be a welcomed addition.**","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some thoughts on the Ledger affair.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think they are able to extract your private key, most likely what they have implemented is what they claim to have implemented: the ability to export encrypted Shamir shards of your private key.

Set up a 25th word passphrase, then use the Trezor T moving forward for everything. Then wipe the ledger used in step 2.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR: Use an existing wiped ledger plugged into wall (so it never touches the internet/a computer/ledgerlive) to generate a fresh seed. Then import it into a Trezor T (open source/battle tested) and set up a 25th secret passphrase and you are good to go.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Or if you are ok with a 12 word seed phrase just set up a Trezor T with a secret passphrase.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the best method I can come up with that doesn&#39;t seem to make too big of a tradeoff on security/convenience (maintains using a 24 word seed, no need for airgapped computers, battle tested, open source software, and can continue to be used with Metamask/Frame etc). Looks like Trezor is also offering a 15% discount right now (wasn&#39;t there yesterday) in light of Ledger&#39;s idiotic move.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-16 22:09:05","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-05-17 22:38:00","id":"jkgpyo9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13jryjf","parent_id":"t3_13jryjf","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/kenzi28","body":"I get the idea behind this, but we are truly fucked if we had to onboard new people to crypto like this.
