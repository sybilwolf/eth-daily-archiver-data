Since ledger's firmware is closed source we had to trust their firmware is secure and doesn't show us malicious transactions to sign \n\n2. Since ledger's secure element was proprietary we had to trust the proprietary secure element was as secure as they claimed and the vendor providing the secure element wasn't tampering with it.\n\n3. We were told that even with a firmware update it wasn't possible to extract the keys from the secure element.\n\n4. If a malicious actor had physical access to the device they will not be able to get out seed phrases.\n\nLedger's trust and security assumptions now:- \n\n1. Since ledger's firmware is closed source we still have to trust their firmware is secure and doesn't show us malicious transactions to sign or *export our keys*. \n\n2. Since ledger's secure element was proprietary we still have to trust the proprietary secure element is as secure as they claimed and the vendor providing the secure element wasn't tampering with it.\n\n3. We have to trust ledger going forward, will not have a backdoor in their firmware.\n\n4. If a malicious actor had physical access to the device and they had the support of an entity powerful enough to coerce ledger to extract out seed phrases with a malicious firmware. (Not sure if having a hidden wallet can be helpful in this scenario)\n\n\nTrezor's trust and security assumptions\n\n1. If a well equipped malicious actor gets hold of your device your keys can be extracted eventually. (This can of course be mitigated by using hidden wallets)\n2.

It tells token creators that their contract should allow users to transfer a token from one address to another, but it doesn&#39;t specify how that process should be implemented. It tells token creators that their contract should be able to say how many tokens are in existence, but it doesn&#39;t specify how the contract should keep track of or calculate that. It tells token creators that given a particular address, their contract should be able to tell the balance of that address, but it doesn&#39;t specify how those balances should be stored or retrieved (or calculated).</p>\n\n<p>In fact, creating a wacky ERC-20 token is a fantastic way to learn Solidity and get a good feel for how absurdly flexible the token standard is. You could, for example, write a token that allows anybody to send anyone&#39;s balance to anyone else at any time. Or that only lets you, the token creator, send people&#39;s balances at all - so nobody else can even send &quot;their own&quot; balances. Or you could write the contract to, when it gets a <code>balanceOf</code> request, check if the address is the token creator&#39;s address, then respond <code>0</code> if it is and <code>1000</code> if it isn&#39;t. That way, <em>every ethereum address except for you</em> &quot;owns&quot; 1000 of the token.
