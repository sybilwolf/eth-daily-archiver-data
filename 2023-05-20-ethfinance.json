[Maker Endgame plan](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-5-phases-of-endgame/20830) is like *seriously* bad. First of all, it isn't written to really justify what it is proposing to do. Like why do they want the majority of their liquidity denominated in DAIv2/MKRv2. That's a terrible idea. Why add 8333*625=$5.2M in sell pressure per year? Like yes that's small compared to the market cap but it is significant compared to their total profit of $40M. Also, why is this the magic number? Where's the analysis of how much liquidity is \"enough\"?\n\nHe's allocation another $13.5M for subdaos which basically are paid entities that work for Maker but have their own governance token. Is that funding also coming straight out of token holder pockets? Is the Maker DAO discontinuing existing divisions to pay for any of this? Again, is over $2M in funding justified for what the SubDAO actually provides the DAO?\n\nNext we get into the \"AI\" stuff.\n\n>The Alignment Artifacts are governance rulebooks built as a unified data structure containing all principles, rules, processes and knowledge of the entire MakerDAO ecosystem. The data is optimized for use with the specialized Governance AI Tools that can modify, improve, summarize and interpret the Alignment Artifacts. The use of AI tools help level the playing field between deeply embedded insiders and more peripheral community members, by making it possible for anyone to participate at a very high level with all relevant facts and nuance available, and audit and verify decisions and actions by insiders in real time.\n\nAs someone who actually understands AI tools, wtf does that mean? I'm quite passionate about the value alignment problem if you hadn't figured that out by now but this text just makes no sense. Is he just proposing using ChatGPT to explain proposals in more basic language to Maker voters? If so, why does this need governance involvement at all? The part that scares me is this: \"AI Tools that can modify ... the Alignment Artifacts.\" Hard no.\n\nIt basically sounds like he wants a Deux Ex style future, all hail our AI overlords, where the very purpose of crypto is for decentralized actors to embody our values and direct code to uphold them, not the other way around.\n\nIf MKR voters go along with this, they are going to get exactly what they deserve. I personally barely have any DAI exposure at this point anyway. The ecosystem has moved away from 3CRV as a base pairing which was the free lunch Maker was getting for years in the bear market. On Optimism the Velodrome pools are just paired against USDC. On Curve the higher paying pools are paired against FraxBP. On places like GMX DAI is only about 5% of the pool. Frax is a more efficient central bank than Maker is trying to be. LUSD and RAI are more decentralized. What is DAI? I don't even understand the niche they serve best at this point.
