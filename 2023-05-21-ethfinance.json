This is my experience on using Safe for a few days.\n\nDisclaimer:- I'm a smart contract developer (not professional yet) but have 10months of experience building with NFTs, erc-20, NFTs marketplaces, soulbound tokens, EIP-4337 wallets etc, so some of these stuff I was able to do with safe might have been helped by my technical knowledge.\n\nCreating a Safe was straight forward, you go to the safe app, select the total number of owners and the threshold number of owners who need to sign for a transaction. Then you deploy the safe on the chain of your choice. As far as I was able to figure out, you have to deploy a safe for every chain you use(please correct me if I'm wrong in this). I'm not sure if the addresses would be the same on all chains as I'm not sure if they're using create or create2 opcode to create the Safes. But I did hear in a podcast that they'll have that in a coming version release.\n\nOnce you have the safe deployed on-chain, you can update owners and the threshold for transaction at any point in time. \n\nI created a 2/3 multi-sig with owners as frame wallet, tally ho wallet and safe mobile wallet. \n\nI tested it with different transactions like receiving and sending ETH, receiving and sending ERC-20 tokens and NFTs, did swaps in cowswap and tried to mint an ens(this didn't work as the ens app inside the safe app kept loading after the commit transaction). \n\nAll transactions go through the same flow.\n\n1. One of the owners proposes a transaction.(this is not an on-chain action so it doesn't cost gas)\n2. The other owners have to sign that transaction in the queue tab in the safe app till the threshold is reached(this is not an on-chain action so it doesn't cost gas).\n3. One of the owners has to execute the signed transaction. This costs gas as any transaction. \n\nAfter proposing a transaction keep in mind that if that transaction is not signed by the required number of owners and is still in queue. The next transaction with be queued after that. For example, let's say you propose a transaction A and for some reason you decide to not go ahead with A. If you now want to propose a transaction B, you'll have to manually set the nonce to nonce of A, else transaction B with be queued after A and will have to wait till A goes through. It's not a big deal but it's something you have to keep in mind while using it.\n\nAfter the transaction is signed and ready to be executed, you have use one of the owners to execute it on-chain. The gas price for this is set very high by default by the safe application (it was set as 250gwei when gas price on goerli was just 40gwei). You can manually reduce it down to an acceptable amount. \n\nWithin the safe application they have in-built interfaces for many web3 protocols, like ens, cowswap, maker dao etc. I tried ens and cowswap. These were not intuitive as I was expecting and had to open a new tab to sign the transactions there. Using these were overall quite confusing in the beginning, but once you get used to it, it is quite easy.\n\nYou can connect to any web3 application which supports wallet connect using your safe and still be able to interact with contracts that way. I haven't tried this out yet but will try it out soon.\n\nI was even able to try out their transaction builder where you can batch many transactions with any smart contracts. But this needs a little technical knowledge and is probably out of scope for most users.\n\nYou can even upgrade the functionality of your safe by adding modules and guards. Modules are contracts with custom logic which has admin access to the safe, like assigning roles who can spend a certain limit without needing the threshold signature, etc. Guards are contracts which can be used to check for arbitrary conditions before and after a transaction. Like Blacklisting and whitelisting address etc.\n\nAs far as I'm aware and after looking into the Safe's code I don't think they are ERC-4337 compatible yet(I might wrong in this, please correct me if I am) but I heard in a podcast by the co-founder that they are about to upgrade to ERC-4337 soon. Maybe some of you might want to wait for that.\n\nOverall, using a safe with 2 or more signer threshold for everyday use might not be for everyone(although doable if you get the hang of it). But it is great if you are just going to use it as a vault/storage address and going to only be sending and receiving ETH/token/NFTs. It's the ultimate secure cold wallet.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I know a lot of us are trying to move to a multi-sig Safe, including me, so the last few days I&#39;ve been using Safe in the goerli testnet to test it out and work out the kinks so you don&#39;t have to.

If you can&#39;t get it for less than $12, fail the transaction&quot;</p>\n\n<p>A mev bot hears you saying that, so he goes to the seller (uniswap pool) and buys the TFT for $10, and sells it to you for $12, the max you would accept. \nThe mev bot got $2 for almost nothing.</p>\n\n<p>We could go a bit deeper if we take into account that these are liquidity pools and the middleman actually acts <em>on the pool</em>, not on your own transaction, but that&#39;s close enough.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-20 23:52:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jl01eva","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13njevl","parent_id":"t1_jkztyqv","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CaptainLoud","body":"In this scenario, does the bot check if the liquidity pool can already \"fill the buy order\" before buying itself?
