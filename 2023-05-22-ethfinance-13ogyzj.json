Pok\u00e9mon stadium was just added to Nintendo switch online (Nintendo 64 system) and I played it real quick and forgot that back in the day you could actually add your Pok\u00e9mon from the gameboy version to the n64 game. And I immediately thought, NFT\u2019s and metaverse. This game came out in 2000! Having that capability to use the Pok\u00e9mon you earned in one game and use them in another was brilliant. A gaming studio could basically make there own metaverse by releasing a multitude of games that can interact with one another using earned NFT\u2019s or just played as a standalone.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-22 11:22:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jl6rivn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13ogyzj","parent_id":"t3_13ogyzj","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Gravy_Vampire","body":"Not only did I just get done playing Pok\u00e9mon (will play more soon don\u2019t worry, just needed to charge), but I also have my own relevant anecdote.\n\nMy first shiny was caught the hard way (soft reset) on Pok\u00e9mon fire red version for the game boy advance.
