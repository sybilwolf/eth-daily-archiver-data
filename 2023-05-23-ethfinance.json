Some artists were very supportive (like Dave Grohl), many were not.  \n\nMetallica.. I was so sad.. My teenage love for them partly died that day..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Regulations came hard and heavy.  DRM insanity. Birth of Youtube. Now we have Spotify, Soundcloud, dozens of others, enabling users to listen and discover music virtually for free.  No more buying $20 CDs at Walmart with the lyrics censored, containing 12 tracks of dogshit and the one radio hit that you actually wanted to listen to. Artists can get their music out to people easier than ever.\n\nI have a slightly different take on this.. As \"poor\" teenagers, we had to carefully choose what that 20$ was spent on.. I remember taking the bus, the train, and walking 30 mins, just to go to a downtown cd/vinyl store. I could afford just ONE album.. That meant that a) I had done my research the previous days, asking all my friends, reading mags, etc.. b) I would go back home and really listen to the whole thing. Over and over again. I would read all the lyrics, marvel at the covers artwork, exchange mix tapes with my friends.\n\nNowadays, kids have it too easy at discovering music. It's almost endless. It's almost free, it's always available. And that is why they don't give it the focus and respect it should be given.\n\nDon't get me wrong, when I was 15 I WISHED those albums were cheaper.

Down the road I expect dividends will come to crypto, which basically means all you have to do is *own* the token and you will earn yield (staked, not staked, etc. doesn't matter). I think rent extraction will make its way to crypto. But for now tokens that earn yield should add value, like ETH staking secures the network. We need more features where the token really adds value and hence \"deserves\" the yield, apart from governance. \n\nMost of the real yield tokens don't do anything but make the tokens more scarce due to the locking. I understand that mechanic, and again down the road this will probably be the default, but I still believe that tokens that add more value (instead of just extracting value) will be in a better position and worth more. \n\ntl;dr: real yield in a decade is good, real yield today is probably not worth it and just harming the protocol on its way to conquer the market in the best way possible.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So my conclusion after thinking about it for some time: </p>\n\n<p>Both yield via native protocol tokens, but also real yield (if there is some) were probably activated too early. In the end we are playing this game to succeed longterm and by that I don&#39;t mean some months or years, but decades. </p>\n\n<p>If you hand out tokens too early (and there is a fixed supply) you will run out at some point. If you activate real yields too early you might simply miss money that could extend the run way for the startup (and obviously all these protocols are somehow young companies = startups). </p>\n\n<p>In the end I believe that if you have a great product you can survive without yield even if competition acts differently (see e.g. Uniswap vs Sushi or dydx). </p>\n\n<p>On top I changed my mind with regards to &quot;dividends&quot;. Down the road I expect dividends will come to crypto, which basically means all you have to do is <em>own</em> the token and you will earn yield (staked, not staked, etc. doesn&#39;t matter). I think rent extraction will make its way to crypto. But for now tokens that earn yield should add value, like ETH staking secures the network. We need more features where the token really adds value and hence &quot;deserves&quot; the yield, apart from governance. </p>\n\n<p>Most of the real yield tokens don&#39;t do anything but make the tokens more scarce due to the locking. I understand that mechanic, and again down the road this will probably be the default, but I still believe that tokens that add more value (instead of just extracting value) will be in a better position and worth more. </p>\n\n<p>tl;dr: real yield in a decade is good, real yield today is probably not worth it and just harming the protocol on its way to conquer the market in the best way possible.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-23 04:30:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jla012o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13pejil","parent_id":"t1_jl9ka9a","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":">Down the road I expect dividends will come to crypto, which basically means all you have to do is own the token and you will earn yield (staked, not staked, etc. doesn't matter).\n\nI doubt that unless the US/SEC changes it's tune because everyone's too afraid to fuck with the government","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Down the road I expect dividends will come to crypto, which basically means all you have to do is own the token and you will earn yield (staked, not staked, etc. doesn&#39;t matter).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I doubt that unless the US/SEC changes it&#39;s tune because everyone&#39;s too afraid to fuck with the government</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-23 07:39:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jlanx37","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13pejil","parent_id":"t1_jla012o","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"Once stock is tokenised and blockchains are the future of France I think it will be a nobrainer.

Also not on Arbitrum, but I&#39;ve been really liking some of Sommeliers&#39; vaults on mainnet.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-23 11:27:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jlbmgqo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13pejil","parent_id":"t1_jlb4g87","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/696_eth","body":"Ethereum","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-22 22:06:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jl96drc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13pejil","parent_id":"t3_13pejil","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Vinegar_Strokes__","body":"$1857","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$1857</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-22 22:10:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jl96o9x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13pejil","parent_id":"t1_jl96drc","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nixorokish","body":"0.068","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>0.068</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-22 22:48:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jl99zg3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13pejil","parent_id":"t1_jl96o9x","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/juxtanotherposition","body":"# EVMavericks Rocket Pool oDAO update\n\nThere was a meeting planned for Monday but too many people could not make it last minute.

There are so many entrenched direct incentives NOT to fund public goods. Why fund a public healthcare when a private health corp is putting millions into politician&#39;s bank accounts? And those same corps are convincing the general populace public healthcare is against their best interest so they vote the corrupt red or blue politician right back into office. I think the state of current US policy has made it clear that his vision of fixing central banking is a pipe dream.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-23 09:15:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jlb2rkb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13pejil","parent_id":"t1_jla8gq3","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"On top of that, his entire argument is based on the idea that many people don't have internet access.\n\nSurely its easier to achieve universal internet access than what he is proposing.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>On top of that, his entire argument is based on the idea that many people don&#39;t have internet access.</p>\n\n<p>Surely its easier to achieve universal internet access than what he is proposing.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-23 16:34:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jlcwwj0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13pejil","parent_id":"t1_jlb2rkb","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pocketwailord","body":"Exactly.
