I won&#39;t parrot much better advice that is available elsewhere, but the short of it comes down to: be kind, be warm, make them feel listened, connect about unrelated topics you both enjoy, then try to slowly introduce general points (unrelated to HEX directly) that get them to rethink their rationalisations on their own. The change has to come from within.</p>\n\n<p>On the plus side, while a cult can keep their followers on the leash forever, HEX is bound to go down. As the price keeps creeping lower, there will be a point where the cognitive dissonance in your friend will be too big to ignore.</p>\n\n<p>There is the &quot;risk&quot; of the scenario most of us hope for, an up cycle for the overall market coming soon - too soon, and dragging HEX up with it. Which could lead your friend to be stuck in this for a couple more years. But it&#39;s hard to see the scam lasting beyond 2027-2028 in any case.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-24 11:07:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jlggm9p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13qbpch","parent_id":"t1_jlfkf62","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/keynya","body":"At conferences I talked to a lot of people in the crypto space.

For instance, an exchange like Nasdaq settling orders onto its own L2, which then get posted to the L1. These L2s will not be open to the public to use, or have a token a governance or revenue token. They are simply owned by the corporation behind the business and used as the infrastructure necessary to settle onto Ethereum efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>Then IEX, Deutsche Boerse, etc... could do the same. And there would be MEV at the L1 doing inter-exchange arbitrage.</p>\n\n<p>Similar things could be said for other financial corporations. With this I mean to say that the future users of Ethereum L1 might look different than what we have today. The largest users may be rollups settling for large financial corporations, central banks, payment processors each with their own rollup settling onto the L1. They may be immensely valuable but as part of the business that owns them.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-24 02:43:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jlem6q1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13qbpch","parent_id":"t1_jlebght","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"Now obviously L3s are secured by L2s and L2s are secured by L1s, so L1s should be worth more than L2s and L2s should be worth more than L3s. \n\nBut imo we still need a different way to evaluate \"lower level layers\", cause the apps running on top of them will have a different business model than those on L1s/L2s, and hence the valuation maybe should be considered in a different way as well?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Now obviously L3s are secured by L2s and L2s are secured by L1s, so L1s should be worth more than L2s and L2s should be worth more than L3s. </p>\n\n<p>But imo we still need a different way to evaluate &quot;lower level layers&quot;, cause the apps running on top of them will have a different business model than those on L1s/L2s, and hence the valuation maybe should be considered in a different way as well?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-24 00:28:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jlecjwf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13qbpch","parent_id":"t1_jlebght","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Naelex","body":"hmm, my thought of l3's is that the fees are so cheap that a company may subsidize them, in which case they are free for the user, in which case the current model remains.
