I don&#39;t think you can access things on L2s thru etherscan cause you&#39;d get an error. And I think their general sense has been to wait. if I&#39;m understanding correctly there isn&#39;t an issue in doing it but more of waiting for Layer2s to mature.</p>\n\n<p>There are still things like this</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OptiNames/status/1662055825861488641\">https://twitter.com/OptiNames/status/1662055825861488641</a></p>\n\n<p>and there&#39;s also some team that has been working on implementation with starknet. </p>\n\n<p>And ofc you can do offchain stuff. </p>\n\n<p>But to me the 2 most implementations would be, being able to do all the gas stuff on a layer2 for way cheaper while having the domain on mainnet and again that goes back to the 1st point of waiting. And second thing, is to have all the stuff being resolved correctly at least on most active L2s.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-27 21:52:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jlwqagd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13sygtc","parent_id":"t1_jltovoz","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nitter_not_twitter","body":"[https://nitter.snopyta.org/OptiNames/status/1662055825861488641](https://nitter.snopyta.org/OptiNames/status/1662055825861488641)  \n\n ^(I'm a bot | )[^(Why & About)](https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&subject=Opt+Out&message=optout)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://nitter.snopyta.org/OptiNames/status/1662055825861488641\">https://nitter.snopyta.org/OptiNames/status/1662055825861488641</a>  </p>\n\n<p><sup>I&#39;m a bot | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/\"><sup>Why &amp;
