While I was browsing around for upcoming Web3 games I encountered [this article](https://decrypt.co/142527/from-square-enix-to-ubisoft-the-biggest-publishers-building-nft-games) that lists many featured projects from big companies like Enix and Ubisoft. Most of the games still look like they are trying to fit into an NFT profit scheme instead of just incorporating Web3 into a great game. Almost all, except a couple. This one caught my eye:\n\n\nFinally, a Web3 game that looks like it's being designed for gamers! Anyone lucky enough to try out the alpha of the Web3 game [Unioverse](https://www.unioverse.com/)? It looks pretty badass even for a sneak preview of the most rudimentary stage of alpha releases.  The producers are clear on this; this is not the final product and is under construction. \n\nTo be eligible to jump into their [Proving Grounds](https://www.unioverse.com/proving-grounds/) arena you have to have an NFT released last month obtained through challenges or buy it now on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/category/unioverse). The original genesis skins were all on the Ethereum chain, but it appears as if the test account skin NFTs are on the Polygon chain (called Clones). They have it set it up so you can trial run your experience with a Clone (costs 0.08 cents on polygon), and then anyone can transfer that Clone NFT to someone else so they can try out the game. \n\nReviews so far are promising, as many describe it as a hybrid of Halo, Aliens, and Tomb Raider.  The artwork is amazing and they've launched a [Comic Book](https://www.unioverse.com/explore/reyu-the-first-unioverse-comic-book-launches-may-9/) to showcase the beauty of their design. \n\nAnyway, I'm jumping in today and will report back on my experience. As a gamer myself, I'm just so friggin excited to see something like this finally being released. Cya in a few hours!\n\nSize: 4.41 Gb download\n\nCreated acct: Disappointed that I have to provide my tel# for authentication\n\nLogin is via tel# and then you can link your wallet. Make sure to purchase the Clone NFT before loading the game. Or restart it after purchase. \n\nEdit: Well, that was quick! 30 min later I've done the trial run. It has potential, but unfortunately it's just an alpha sneak peak. Not much to it, but it's a huge jump from any of the other web 3 games I've experienced. I'm excited for the actual game. They're currently working on a Battle Royal as their next release and then hopes of a campaign shortly after.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Videogaming is an industry that could accelerate the integration of the cryptoverse everywhere. While I was browsing around for upcoming Web3 games I encountered <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/142527/from-square-enix-to-ubisoft-the-biggest-publishers-building-nft-games\">this article</a> that lists many featured projects from big companies like Enix and Ubisoft. Most of the games still look like they are trying to fit into an NFT profit scheme instead of just incorporating Web3 into a great game. Almost all, except a couple. This one caught my eye:</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a Web3 game that looks like it&#39;s being designed for gamers! Anyone lucky enough to try out the alpha of the Web3 game <a href=\"https://www.unioverse.com/\">Unioverse</a>? It looks pretty badass even for a sneak preview of the most rudimentary stage of alpha releases.  The producers are clear on this; this is not the final product and is under construction. </p>\n\n<p>To be eligible to jump into their <a href=\"https://www.unioverse.com/proving-grounds/\">Proving Grounds</a> arena you have to have an NFT released last month obtained through challenges or buy it now on <a href=\"https://opensea.io/category/unioverse\">OpenSea</a>.
