Then, they would maintain a permissioned fork of the IGSS until the canonical data was received.

The incumbent dictator, of course, ignored this STOP and continued broadcasting transactions as if he had never been overthrown.\n\nThe first messages posted by this dictator were the financial equivalent of an SOS - a monumental bounty for his own safe extraction from the Grars 8052 sector. Because Crov MDK6 had not received the STOP message due to the outage, they incorrectly assumed that the dictator\u2019s bounty was valid on-chain, thus the Crov MDK6 financial district placed large investments in contracts for the dictator\u2019s extraction by galactic bounty hunters local to Grars 8052. These contracts had already been sent over the FTL system, were 40 days into their 90 day delivery time, and could not be rescinded.\n\nIn the ensuing financial mess, Crov MDK6\u2019s private sector had paid a handsome sum to the bounty hunters, while they had themselves expected to be reimbursed by the Grars 8052 dictator\u2019s (invalid) contract. Due to the exceedingly low probability of a STOP message being sent during the outage (typically STOP messages are only broadcast every few hundred years), Crov MDK6\u2019s private sector had ignored this tail-event risk, oversizing their investments to profit from the Grars dictator\u2019s generous (but ultimately invalid) contract. This left Crov\u2019s financial markets in debt and in ruin, leading to the Great Crov Depression of the early 3000s, eventually resulting in the Democratic Party Of Socialism taking the Crov presidency for the first time in over 700 years of running against the incumbent Democratic Party Of Free Markets.
