It's fundamentally an economic incentive issue (hint: you can read between the lines in half the replies below). And I don't see how this gets fixed... first move advantage wins again, and the 'event horizon' has passed. This isn't getting resolved easily. \n\n* I tried to help u/superphiz with his 22% limit (see: [my GitHub page](https://github.com/BobRossiETH/ETH-Staking-Service-22Cap-Signaling) where I tried to help community engagement). Outside of a few token responses by projects that would never reach 22% anyway, nothing. Funnily enough, to Lido's credit (yucky!) they were actually one of the few projects to take the request seriously, although it was shot down by governance pretty handily. \n   * I don't care enough to link the thread (unless you really want me too, I can), but Lido governance made it clearly it doesn't really think they are doing anything wrong. They view themselves as a Union type entity. And while I've saved my hear the struggle by not keeping up with it... I'm doubtful much of their internally proposed solutions to help mitigate risk made it to pass, or were super low hanging fruit. \n* I worked with u/hanniabu for a bit on [https://ethsunshine.com/](https://ethsunshine.com/). Hanniabu put in a ton of work on the project so everyone here should be sending their thankyous to him, but it ultimately fizzled out due to lack of really anyone else putting in any effort for that site. (And yes, don't put me on any pedestal, I contributed some writing to help but it was 98% hanniabu here. Hell, probably 102% as anything I contributed was probably doubled by his effort in giving me a pseudo github lesson lol) \n* I tried to convince the EVMavericks to pursue buying some LIDO and get a r/ethfianance or EVM holder to be a representative in their DAO. Went about as well (and controversially) as expected. I'm not even sure if it was a good idea. I probably could have tried harder, but it was clear any engagement would be minimal so my the slack in slacktivism took over. \n\nThe unfiltered and harsh truth is three big things, among many:\n\n1. Decentralized Layer 1 equals a Decentralized Layer 0. It's hard as hell to coordinate anything with Layer 0 and as were finding out unless it comes from big names / the EF / economic forces, things simply don't get attention until the stars align and they just sort of happen.

It&#39;s fundamentally an economic incentive issue (hint: you can read between the lines in half the replies below). And I don&#39;t see how this gets fixed... first move advantage wins again, and the &#39;event horizon&#39; has passed. This isn&#39;t getting resolved easily. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I tried to help <a href=\"/u/superphiz\">u/superphiz</a> with his 22% limit (see: <a href=\"https://github.com/BobRossiETH/ETH-Staking-Service-22Cap-Signaling\">my GitHub page</a> where I tried to help community engagement). Outside of a few token responses by projects that would never reach 22% anyway, nothing. Funnily enough, to Lido&#39;s credit (yucky!) they were actually one of the few projects to take the request seriously, although it was shot down by governance pretty handily. \n\n<ul>\n<li>I don&#39;t care enough to link the thread (unless you really want me too, I can), but Lido governance made it clearly it doesn&#39;t really think they are doing anything wrong. They view themselves as a Union type entity. And while I&#39;ve saved my hear the struggle by not keeping up with it... I&#39;m doubtful much of their internally proposed solutions to help mitigate risk made it to pass, or were super low hanging fruit. </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>I worked with <a href=\"/u/hanniabu\">u/hanniabu</a> for a bit on <a href=\"https://ethsunshine.com/\">https://ethsunshine.com/</a>. Hanniabu put in a ton of work on the project so everyone here should be sending their thankyous to him, but it ultimately fizzled out due to lack of really anyone else putting in any effort for that site. (And yes, don&#39;t put me on any pedestal, I contributed some writing to help but it was 98% hanniabu here. Hell, probably 102% as anything I contributed was probably doubled by his effort in giving me a pseudo github lesson lol) </li>\n<li>I tried to convince the EVMavericks to pursue buying some LIDO and get a <a href=\"/r/ethfianance\">r/ethfianance</a> or EVM holder to be a representative in their DAO. Went about as well (and controversially) as expected. I&#39;m not even sure if it was a good idea. I probably could have tried harder, but it was clear any engagement would be minimal so my the slack in slacktivism took over. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The unfiltered and harsh truth is three big things, among many:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Decentralized Layer 1 equals a Decentralized Layer 0.

Here's a summary of the key points, where CASP stands for Crypto Asset Service Provider:\n\n1. **Regulatory Framework:** IOSCO encourages regulators to use either existing or new frameworks to regulate CASP activities such as crypto-asset trading, issuing, marketing, and selling. The goal is to ensure market integrity and investor protection on par with traditional financial markets.\n\n2. **CASP Governance:** CASPs should have robust governance, systems, and policies to handle potential conflicts of interest. Acute conflicts may require legal disaggregation and separate regulation.\n\n3. **Role Disclosure:** CASPs should clearly disclose their role and capacity in non-technical language. This disclosure should occur before entering an agreement and anytime when their position changes.\n\n4. **Client Order Handling:** When acting as an agent, a CASP should handle client orders fairly. Disclosure of systems, policies, and procedures regarding order execution should be made to clients.\n\n5. **Pre- and Post-trade Disclosures:** CASPs that operate a market or act as an intermediary should provide pre- and post-trade disclosures akin to those in traditional financial markets.\n\n6. **Listing Standards:** CASPs should establish, maintain, and disclose their standards for listing or removing crypto-assets from trading.\n\n7. **Conflict of Interest Mitigation:** CASPs should manage and mitigate conflicts of interest surrounding the issuance, trading, and listing of crypto-assets.\n\n8. **Enforcement Against Fraud:** Regulators should enforce actions against fraudulent activities and market abuse in the crypto-asset markets.\n\n9. **Market Surveillance:** CASPs should have market surveillance requirements to mitigate market abuse risks.\n\n10. **Non-public Information Management:** CASPs should manage non-public information and disclose it where relevant.\n\n11. **Cross-border Cooperation:** Due to the global nature of crypto-assets, regulators should cooperate and share information with counterparts in other jurisdictions.\n\n12. **Protection of Client Assets:** CASPs should apply IOSCO's recommendations on the protection of client assets, segregate client assets from proprietary assets, and disclose clear information about how client assets are held.\n\n13. **Asset Reconciliation:** CASPs should conduct regular reconciliations of client assets, subject to independent assurance.\n\n14. **Risk Mitigation:** CASPs should adopt systems to mitigate the risk of loss, theft, or inaccessibility of client assets and comply with requirements pertaining to operational and technology risk and resilience.\n\n15. **Retail Client Interactions:** CASPs should operate in a manner consistent with IOSCO\u2019s Standards regarding interactions and dealings with retail clients.
