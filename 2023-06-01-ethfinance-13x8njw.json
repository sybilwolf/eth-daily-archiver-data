Timmy is onboard but now he needs 10 ball and cup.</em></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, remember how i told you these are valuable Timmy? I&#39;ll need you to give me the savings from your college fund, but think how much you&#39;ll make, 10,000% APY little buddy. &quot;</p>\n\n<p><em>Timmy goes all in on ball and cup and won&#39;t shut up to anyone who asks about how fun the game is. He convinces his friends to play and for a week things are good. Eventually his friends realise it&#39;s not a fun game but there&#39;s no other kids to give them money like Timmy is taking theirs. They stop playing and cut Timmy out of their social group. Timmy made $100, has $10,000 worth of ball and cup that no one will buy, and no friends.</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-01 16:08:51","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-06-01 16:14:09","id":"jmjjsv0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13x8njw","parent_id":"t3_13x8njw","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/NeedlerOP","body":"Am I timmy?\n\nIs cumrocket ball and sticks ?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Am I timmy?</p>\n\n<p>Is cumrocket ball and sticks ?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-01 16:11:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jmjk8r2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13x8njw","parent_id":"t1_jmjjsv0","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I edited to ball and cup so now it looks like you can't read, sorry \ud83d\ude05.\n\nTimmy doesn't have any friends, you are not Timmy.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I edited to ball and cup so now it looks like you can&#39;t read, sorry \ud83d\ude05.</p>\n\n<p>Timmy doesn&#39;t have any friends, you are not Timmy.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-01 16:33:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jmjn7ff","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13x8njw","parent_id":"t1_jmjk8r2","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-01 20:47:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jmkjqzc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13x8njw","parent_id":"t1_jmjjsv0","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I respect your vision, that is how NFT gaming is sold as a concept.

So the actual ETH/DAI/rETH is moving over the official bridge, but you don&#39;t have to wait because the bonders provided the bridged asset to you right away and then they get their share on the backend.</p>\n\n<p>I believe why all pools are on L2s only is because there are L2 token equivalents (begin with h) that work as the intermediary asset. These h-tokens on L2 represent a 1:1 ratio of underlying L1 token. </p>\n\n<p>Hmm, hopefully that makes sense. It probably glosses over a few things but thats the gist of it.
