[Exodus Privacy](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.reddit.frontpage/latest/) gives a good overview of the embedded trackers and requested permissions.\n\nFor the first group, it currently lists Branch, Google CrashLytics, Google Firebase Analytics, Instabug, and OpenTelemetry. This is fairly standard, and all of these trackers are rather reputable compared to what other choices exist on the market (of course that doesn't mean I like that Reddit includes these). Regarding permissions, I don't consider any of them intrusive because dangerous ones can be denied at runtime. (Notice that Exodus describes `WRITE_SETTINGS` as dangerous, but it's not displaying the full permission name - those two are actually for displaying notification badges in Huawei and Oppo default app launchers).\n\nSomething that Exodus does not display though, is the package visibilty queries of an app, which IMO is a very important list. The context behind this feature is that Android restricts the list of other installed apps visible to any given app whcih targets Android 11 or later (which most apps in Google Play now do following latest publishing requirements). This is useful because the list of installed apps is a unique identifier. Now this new query list also explicitly describes what other apps a given app wants to communicate with.\n\nI used [App Manager](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager/) to read the manifest of the official Reddit app and found the following package visibility queries: Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Google Messages (the default text app on many Android devices), Facebook Messenger, and Google Maps. It is possible that Reddit only uses these queries for benign purposes, for example to easily open a location on the map or share something with better integration, but there is nothing that restricts it from exchanging ad/tracking-related communication with Google, Meta, and Snap.\n\nOne more thing that the app manifest can hint about without looking into the bytecode is other third-party libraries used in the app, based on full activity/service/receiver/intent names (like com.google.android... just for third-parties). For the Reddit app, I found Sendbird and Twilio, with the former also listening to Huawei push messages (based on the intent name in the filter).\n\nOut of interest, I took a look at [the report](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.discord/latest/) of the Discord app too. Exodus lists Adjust and Google Analytics trackers, but App Manager finds Sentry as well. I've never heard of Adjust before, but looks reasonable, along with the other two. For permissions, same situation as with Reddit, nothing to worry about. Package queries of Discord are the following: Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Twitter, LINE, and Spotify. Strange choice of third parties. I found no other SDKs from the manifest.\n\nOf course, most Android apps use the basic Android SDKs by Google, so naturally they can share any information through those as well, even if no other Google-related trackers show up in any of the lists.\n\nThis high-level look is usually enough for me to decide if I want to use an app or not. Both are rather reasonable compared to other popular apps. Still, it is a question for everyone's threat model if potentially tying personal accounts to a crypto-related Reddit username through ads and trackers is acceptable.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>With the news about Reddit restricting the API for third-party apps, I decided to take a high-level look at the official Android app from a privacy perspective. <a href=\"https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.reddit.frontpage/latest/\">Exodus Privacy</a> gives a good overview of the embedded trackers and requested permissions.</p>\n\n<p>For the first group, it currently lists Branch, Google CrashLytics, Google Firebase Analytics, Instabug, and OpenTelemetry.

Some sort of hybrid with communal living in touch with nature but without giving up living in a modern industrial society would go a long way. Ethereum or something like it would undoubtedly be a key part of this. Accepting the use of psychedelics for those who are in a healthy enough state to take them responsibly and with respect might also help but we also need a lot more research on that topic too.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the ChatGPT thing, you know why it&#39;s frustrating to other users here. It has its uses but discussing a novel technology and trying to provide deep insight isn&#39;t one of them. It blurs the lines of useful content and it&#39;s just not helpful most of the time. You may have noticed you&#39;re not the only one here who uses ChatGPT for their comments. The reason why others haven&#39;t had backlash is because they tell us when their comment was AI generated. This allows people to realise they may need to do a bit of extra fact checking or tells them, its supposed to be a comment which is educational in nature (which is ChatGPT&#39;s strong point), not insightful.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-04 19:46:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jmxy9fp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1401prr","parent_id":"t1_jmxkjqz","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-04 19:55:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jmxzdtr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1401prr","parent_id":"t1_jmxy9fp","score":-5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"That's because it's seen by most people as you whining about getting downvoted for using ChatGPT.
