The podcast started in 2016 and just some days ago the 500th episode aired... Unchained covers all coins and ecosystems, regulation topics etc. Most of the episodes are interviews with (a) guest(s).

This podcast is rather new, started in mid 2022 I think. There are (from my understanding) two different kinds of episodes: a roundup that summarizes last weeks news/ events and season, which consists of various episodes around a focus topic. On top there are some \"0xResearch\" episodes, that also seem to be semi-connected to the bell curve podcast. Focus seems to be on ETH and Cosmos (apparently also sponsor of the podcast), but there is no dedicated focus on any ecosystem. \n\nThis podcast focusses more on the business/ financial dimension of crypto. It's even possible the hosts talk about stock. I found this podcast recently and checked the whole season 4 which was about MEV, a topic I really like. These episodes were mostly great.

Thanks in advance","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everybody! I rarely post, but have a question I trust ethfinancer\u2019s opinion on. I\u2019m in a financial situation where I could benefit from selling some ethereum, yet the thought of doing so is gut-wrenching. I haven\u2019t looking into nor done much research on putting up eth as collateral for a USD loan, and I feel like I remember people getting rekt from these type of actions over the years. Is this a safe thing to do, is it a stupid thing to do, should I just sell eth and eat the cost, or is there a safe, minimal risk way to put up eth as collateral for a USD loan? Are there decentralized routes for doing this? So far all I\u2019ve been able to find are cefi routes like nexo. Any insight here or resources to suggest I read would be greatly appreciated.
