The unbonding period may mean it can take weeks for a crypto asset validator to unstake\ncrypto assets (or release them from staking) and transfer or use them for other purposes. During\nthe time the crypto assets are bonded to a protocol, the crypto asset owners are unable to transact in\nthem, for example, to react to market price fluctuations of the crypto assets\n\n\nNow about coinbase staking:\n\n> Through its Staking Program, Coinbase offers and markets an investment\nopportunity to receive rewards from proof-of-stake blockchains and gain benefits that may not be\navailable to those investors if they were to stake crypto assets on their own. In particular, the\nStaking Program offers investors the ability, through Coinbase\u2019s efforts, to obtain returns based on\nCoinbase\u2019s participation in proof-of-stake activities for the five staking-eligible crypto assets.\nIndeed, in a YouTube video marketing its Staking Program, Coinbase stated, \u201c[w]hile it\u2019s possible to\nstake crypto on your own, this can be confusing, complicated, and costly\u201d and touted that \u201cCoinbase\nis changing all that.\u201d\n\n\n> Specifically, the Coinbase Staking Program offers and markets several features that\ndifferentiate it from what staking investors would be able to do by staking and earning rewards on\ntheir own.\n\n> For one, the Coinbase Staking Program offers no, or low, staking minimums or\ndeposits. Staking protocols typically require a certain threshold number of crypto assets, or an\nadditional refundable deposit, to be able to participate in staking, and investors who stake on their\nown\u2014not with Coinbase\u2014are subject to those minimum thresholds. For example, the Ethereum blockchain requires users to stake a minimum of 32 ETH (currently approximately $60,000) to run a\nvalidator node. But the Coinbase Staking Program allows investors to participate in staking without\nhaving to meet such thresholds; as Coinbase touts, investors can \u201c[s]tart earning with as little as $1.\u201d\n\n\n> Relatedly, running a validator node is often expensive, for example due to equipment\nand/or software needed to stake. Through the Coinbase Staking Program, investors avoid paying\nthose expenses because Coinbase operates its own validator nodes to earn and pay investor rewards.\nFor example, CGI\u2019s February 21, 2023 annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and available\non Coinbase\u2019s website stated: \u201cStaking independently requires a participant to run their own\nhardware, software, and maintain close to 100% up-time. We provide a service known as \u2018Delegated\nProof of Stake,\u2019 which reduces the complexities of staking.\u201d Similarly, Coinbase acknowledged on\nits website that \u201c[b]ecoming a validator is a major responsibility and requires a fairly high level of\ntechnical knowledge.\u201d\n\n> Further, until approximately April 2023, the Coinbase Staking Program maintained a\n\u201cliquidity pool\u201d of crypto assets\u2014for each of the five stakeable assets\u2014that were held in reserve,\nwhich enabled Coinbase to provide investors faster liquidity in connection with unstaking requests.\nEffective April 1, 2023, Coinbase purports to no longer maintain reserves of stakeable assets. In or\naround October 2022, in response to an FAQ on its website (\u201cCan I trade or send funds while\nthey\u2019re earning rewards\u201d), Coinbase stated: \u201cYou\u2019ll typically be able to cash out your cryptocurrency\nthat\u2019s earning rewards on Coinbase as you would any other cryptocurrency. Cashing out may be\nsubject to factors including, but not limited to, your account history, transaction history, and\nbanking history. In rare circumstances, trades and cash-outs may be delayed while we wait for\nstaked funds to be unlocked.\u201d As a result, during the Relevant Period, Coinbase was able to offer\ninvestors enhanced liquidity and quicker reward payments compared to staking on their own.\n(Currently, in response to the same FAQ, Coinbase\u2019s website states: \u201cFunds can\u2019t be traded or sent while they\u2019re staked and earning rewards. You\u2019ll need to unstake them first.\u201d)\n\n\n> 321. Coinbase has also offered bonuses to Staking Program participants during the\nRelevant Period. For example, in or around June 2022, in a marketing email soliciting staking\ninvestors for ETH, Coinbase promised: \u201cStake at least $100 to earn [a] $10 bonus \u2026 We\u2019ll deposit\nthe $10 ETH bonus to your account within 45 days. That\u2019s it! You don\u2019t have to do anything else.\u201d\nAs set forth in Coinbase\u2019s User Agreement, Coinbase also offers, on a promotional basis, \u201cBoosted\nStaking Rewards\u201d where specified investors (\u201cCoinbase One members\u201d) are offered \u201chigher net\nreward rates\u201d (as a result of Coinbase taking \u201clower commissions\u201d) for certain stakeable assets. \n\n\nLots of allegations about Coinbase Staking, but doesnt argue that staking itself is a securities transaction/operation\n\nIncludes a full howey test analysis of now Coinbase Staking is a securities transaction\n\n> iii.

In particular, the\nStaking Program offers investors the ability, through Coinbase\u2019s efforts, to obtain returns based on\nCoinbase\u2019s participation in proof-of-stake activities for the five staking-eligible crypto assets.\nIndeed, in a YouTube video marketing its Staking Program, Coinbase stated, \u201c[w]hile it\u2019s possible to\nstake crypto on your own, this can be confusing, complicated, and costly\u201d and touted that \u201cCoinbase\nis changing all that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the Coinbase Staking Program offers and markets several features that\ndifferentiate it from what staking investors would be able to do by staking and earning rewards on\ntheir own.</p>\n\n<p>For one, the Coinbase Staking Program offers no, or low, staking minimums or\ndeposits. Staking protocols typically require a certain threshold number of crypto assets, or an\nadditional refundable deposit, to be able to participate in staking, and investors who stake on their\nown\u2014not with Coinbase\u2014are subject to those minimum thresholds. For example, the Ethereum blockchain requires users to stake a minimum of 32 ETH (currently approximately $60,000) to run a\nvalidator node. But the Coinbase Staking Program allows investors to participate in staking without\nhaving to meet such thresholds; as Coinbase touts, investors can \u201c[s]tart earning with as little as $1.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Relatedly, running a validator node is often expensive, for example due to equipment\nand/or software needed to stake. Through the Coinbase Staking Program, investors avoid paying\nthose expenses because Coinbase operates its own validator nodes to earn and pay investor rewards.\nFor example, CGI\u2019s February 21, 2023 annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and available\non Coinbase\u2019s website stated: \u201cStaking independently requires a participant to run their own\nhardware, software, and maintain close to 100% up-time. We provide a service known as \u2018Delegated\nProof of Stake,\u2019 which reduces the complexities of staking.\u201d Similarly, Coinbase acknowledged on\nits website that \u201c[b]ecoming a validator is a major responsibility and requires a fairly high level of\ntechnical knowledge.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Further, until approximately April 2023, the Coinbase Staking Program maintained a\n\u201cliquidity pool\u201d of crypto assets\u2014for each of the five stakeable assets\u2014that were held in reserve,\nwhich enabled Coinbase to provide investors faster liquidity in connection with unstaking requests.\nEffective April 1, 2023, Coinbase purports to no longer maintain reserves of stakeable assets. In or\naround October 2022, in response to an FAQ on its website (\u201cCan I trade or send funds while\nthey\u2019re earning rewards\u201d), Coinbase stated: \u201cYou\u2019ll typically be able to cash out your cryptocurrency\nthat\u2019s earning rewards on Coinbase as you would any other cryptocurrency. Cashing out may be\nsubject to factors including, but not limited to, your account history, transaction history, and\nbanking history. In rare circumstances, trades and cash-outs may be delayed while we wait for\nstaked funds to be unlocked.\u201d As a result, during the Relevant Period, Coinbase was able to offer\ninvestors enhanced liquidity and quicker reward payments compared to staking on their own.\n(Currently, in response to the same FAQ, Coinbase\u2019s website states: \u201cFunds can\u2019t be traded or sent while they\u2019re staked and earning rewards. You\u2019ll need to unstake them first.\u201d)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Coinbase has also offered bonuses to Staking Program participants during the\nRelevant Period. For example, in or around June 2022, in a marketing email soliciting staking\ninvestors for ETH, Coinbase promised: \u201cStake at least $100 to earn [a] $10 bonus \u2026 We\u2019ll deposit\nthe $10 ETH bonus to your account within 45 days. That\u2019s it! You don\u2019t have to do anything else.\u201d\nAs set forth in Coinbase\u2019s User Agreement, Coinbase also offers, on a promotional basis, \u201cBoosted\nStaking Rewards\u201d where specified investors (\u201cCoinbase One members\u201d) are offered \u201chigher net\nreward rates\u201d (as a result of Coinbase taking \u201clower commissions\u201d) for certain stakeable assets. </li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lots of allegations about Coinbase Staking, but doesnt argue that staking itself is a securities transaction/operation</p>\n\n<p>Includes a full howey test analysis of now Coinbase Staking is a securities transaction</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>iii.

Clearly if I pay someone to take care of my vegetable garden and reap any profits after selling the veggies, then they are not selling me unregistered securities. On the other hand, if I deposit money into coinbase, they stake my eth, give me a liquid staking derivative, take some of the profits and give me the rest, that's (according to the howey test) clearly selling a security. So what is the difference between these two?\n\nFirst, obviously the 'liquid staking derivative' part is prolematic. So let's take that away first. Let's say it still works the same, but coinbase doesn't give you the ability to trade staked eth. Is it still a security? Well, first and third prong (investment of money and profits from the works of others) still apply. Is it still a common enterprise? Not sure.
