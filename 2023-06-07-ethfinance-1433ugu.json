Ethereum PoS protocol itself was re-architected several times. Rollup-centric roadmap emerged not that long ago. Modularity is a good practice for reasons that can take time to pay off. Of course its possible to waste time by modularizing too early or along the wrong boundaries, but I feel the Ethereum ecosystem is practically built on the concept of modularizing logic into a fractal of applications running on shared state. It makes sense that modularization would be a priority of infrastructure projects in the space.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-07 03:27:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jn8jmwk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1433ugu","parent_id":"t1_jn8dy12","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/InsideTheSimulation","body":"\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f aliens \ud83e\udd1a","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f aliens \ud83e\udd1a</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-07 05:14:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jn8u74a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1433ugu","parent_id":"t3_1433ugu","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"But can they land without crashing? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I have no idea what this is all about and what started it, but yesterday was apparently a lot of CT drama?)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>But can they land without crashing? </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>(I have no idea what this is all about and what started it, but yesterday was apparently a lot of CT drama?)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-07 05:25:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jn8vei1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1433ugu","parent_id":"t1_jn8u74a","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/tutamtumikia","body":"Same story, new packaging.

I wanted to write but I didnt really know where to put 'writing' into my life, I did write a few things here and there, mostly psychology and mental health related but that's about it.

It's kinda funny but I met some people who are still not a fan of Ethereum yet they work on some projects that are built on Ethereum and contribute to the ecosystem. I mean they can hold whatever assets they want but if they are spending their energy contributing to this ecosystem rather than contributing to the ecosystem the asset they believe of - maybe it says something.

There are parts where we can improve mechanics to make MEV harder (e.g. encrypting transactions so people can't be frontrun or the mechanic you describe where you participate in the MEV that you (involuntarily) create , but some MEV will always be there (there is a term for it, which I can't recall right now but it boils down to \"bad MEV\" = e.g. frontrunning and \"good MEV\" e.g. liquidations that are necessary for defi to work. \n\nMy point is also more: blockchains are \"new\". There are new developments/ discoveries regularly, both on a technical level, but also with regards to the economics of blockchains. Partly because users are involved, but also because there is competition/ new chains with new approaches. \n\nPeople have been telling us for more than 2 years now that \"within one year new users will never touch L1\" and I guess we can also conclude that this is sadly not true.
