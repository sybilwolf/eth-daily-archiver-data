CRV emissions are corporate expanses for obtaining bigger market share and increasing its revenue. And it works. \n\nTheir spending is high (very high inflation), but for 99% of the time, you always could easily get higher APR on CRV than the inflation. CRV token price is downtrend only, that's the fact, but change the charts from price to market cap, and it is steady climb up in ETH terms for over 3 years. \n\nAll the APR above the inflation is just a cherry on top of that. \n\nCRV controlling emissions of CRV might not be very intuitive, but it is not much different for anything you do in trad fi. Just convert all the tokens as well as stocks to underlying USD values, and viola, it all makes sens and can be used in CAPM and other valuation models. \n\nThe rule of thumb for any DeFi project, is not to measure your share in nominal terms, but as a %% of the project's market cap.

CRV emissions are corporate expanses for obtaining bigger market share and increasing its revenue. And it works. </p>\n\n<p>Their spending is high (very high inflation), but for 99% of the time, you always could easily get higher APR on CRV than the inflation. CRV token price is downtrend only, that&#39;s the fact, but change the charts from price to market cap, and it is steady climb up in ETH terms for over 3 years. </p>\n\n<p>All the APR above the inflation is just a cherry on top of that. </p>\n\n<p>CRV controlling emissions of CRV might not be very intuitive, but it is not much different for anything you do in trad fi. Just convert all the tokens as well as stocks to underlying USD values, and viola, it all makes sens and can be used in CAPM and other valuation models. </p>\n\n<p>The rule of thumb for any DeFi project, is not to measure your share in nominal terms, but as a %% of the project&#39;s market cap. The yield offered should cover your dilution in well lead projects.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-08 04:35:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jndqs0w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_143ztf8","parent_id":"t1_jncz4fp","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SpontaneousDream","body":">crvUSD is cool because of the \"liquidation\" mechanics.

Curve is not very well documented and often poorly understood. Speaking to your post specifically:\n\n> I\u2019m trying to think how much wstETH you\u2019d have to deposit to make this worth the fees. L2 would be great to have this feature but then again you\u2019re taking on L2 risk as well.\n\nI wouldn't touch this until more time has passed. I probably wouldn't expect any amount under $25k to generate profits in excess of gas, and I wouldn't put that in unless it's less than 1% of your portfolio. So multi-millionaires can experiment here during this period of high risk, but I wouldn't suggest you do it until more time has passed, more money is in it, and the risk parameters of it have been more thoroughly digested and understood.\n\n>Anyways, what the big risk here? I\u2019m guessing just contract risk, but Curve has been pretty reliable and time tested now. There\u2019s crvUSD risk, but even if crvUSD fails, borrowing it against wstETH wouldn\u2019t affect your collateral. Overall it seems fairly okay?\n\nYes there is contract risk. There is also price risk. The liquidation system is more gradual and forgiving than Maker but you can still lose several percent which can easily outweigh the interest spread you find in Defi right now. I'm not worried about the crvUSD price failing as a borrower. You borrow and sell it to a different yield source, so your exposure to the price only matters at the time of your sale. If the peg fails to the bottom side you can repay the loan for cheaper.\n\n>As for Curve itself\u2026I am still a bit hesitant simply because its tokenomics and overall system feel a bit\u2026ponzi-ish to me? Or, should I say \u201cartificial\u201d? Open to rebuttals here. Some days it feels ponzi-ish/artificial, other days it feels like they\u2019re the cutting edge of tokenomics and DAO function. They did in fact pioneer the vote escrow model which many other projects have copied- but to me the vote escrow thing is just a part of what I call a \u201cmanufactured flywheel\u201d.\n\nSo, this is one of those difficult to understand bits. CRV issuance costs are offset with bribes. Practically they are like an Olympus DAO bond where the Curve DAO is trading away the token at a loss over time. What this does to the marketplace is it distorts the liquidity allocation on Curve from a trading fee optimal allocation to a trading fee + issuance optimal allocation. Liquidity is directed to pools that are more net optimal for CRV voters. The customers of this system are DAOs or other entities that want to create a like-kind asset and need liquidity depth on it to protect their peg. Between all the synthetic ETH tokens and stablecoins, that's a serious use case that Curve dominates. It's less flywheel and more just a feature of the Curve exchange for a different customer base than traders and LPs.\n\nThe vote escrow model to me is an often cited and less interest part of the tokenomic design. A vote escrow token inevitably just creates a liquid locker. That just means that capital doesn't like being locked and so someone like Convex, Concentrator, or StakeDAO creates a contract that max locks it on your behalf and gives you a tradable token in return so you're capital is not really locked. This bypass around the veToken model is apparently a service that the majority of CRV holders are willing to use even if it costs them a management fee to do so. I personally like Alchemix's pending Flux design better for this. Tokenize the unlock and make the cost of the unlock itself a market-based good.\n\n> Further, CRV just feels like a farming coin and in my mind has no real value besides simply voting on how much CRV gets emitted\u2026how can something have value if it\u2019s used to vote on rewards for itself? Does that give it value? Idk. I don\u2019t think so because by that logic anyone can create the same artificial flywheel effect. Again, open to rebuttals here and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong somewhere.\n\nDid you know the Curve exchange takes 50% of the [trading revenue from LPs](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html#fee-distribution)? Curve is the second largest DEX. Those fees are significant. Furthermore CRV holders get the bribes related to issuance and another cut of their own CRV issuance for admin fees. That adds up to a pretty serious revenue stream. The issuance is of course a cost but I encourage you to look deeper at how the admin fees work, the percentage of Curve issuance in $'s that is paid back to Curve voters in bribes, and how much trading revenue the Curve system generates due to its high volume.\n\n> Lastly, CRV is at all time lows against ETH and nearing all time low against BTC. Not a good look.\n\nNo arguments there.\n\nI would like to talk about what happens as the CRV price goes to zero on the Curve exchange. Does it lose all its volume and implode or will it find some equilibrium based on the fundamental value of its smart contracts? First, lower CRV price or lower CRV issuance both diminish the amount of bribes received. So assume CRV price was zero. Basically bribes just offset a fraction of issuance which is why I think they are more akin to an Olympus bond. DAOs that want liquidity depth will therefore stop bribing CRV voters and instead bribe the pools directly. They still want their liquidity depth and can't just own it all themselves outside so they will resort to renting what they need. The net result of this is it will be less capital efficient for those DAOs, so they will be able to offer less APR this way, so some fraction of the liquidity will be pulled from Curve pools. However, this is still the best game in town for like-kind assets, so they will stay on Curve and continue to bring in volume. Again, 50% of those trading fees are taken by the Curve contracts so that's going to generate a non-zero amount of revenue for CRV holders. This will create APR for CRV that is not powered by inflation. If the CRV price was zero, this APR would be infinite, so assume it will instead force the price above zero. This creates a floor on the CRV price that's diluted as the circulating supply expands. Again I encourage you to look at the actual value capture mechanism for those trading revenues. It's indirect but present. The result of this line of thinking is Curve can't and won't death spiral to zero. There is a floor, there is just a question of where that floor is. For that you need to model what percent of the liquidity will leave as the CRV price falls, what the trading volume of the system will be in a difficult to forecast market, and the demand for and interest rate on crvUSD which is a whole new revenue line I barely touched.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Poke <a href=\"/u/_WebOfTrust\">/u/_WebOfTrust</a> since you asked.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve written a lot about Curve and its tokenomics in pieces and replies if you search my comment history.

If SOL is deemed a security by the court it's the exchanges who listed it that may be at fault under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I would expect most VCs aren't going to be liable for selling directly to unaccredited investors and are either selling to MMs OTC (legally), or are market making directly themselves on an exchange (legally), or just waiting and dumping themselves directly on an exchange (grossly, but also legally--again it would be the exchange at fault here, not the VCs). \n\n> That's why it's Solana's fault in a legal way procedurally *but they and the VCs will still be held liable for an unregistered securities offering.* \n\nSolana could likewise not be in trouble here if they handled things the right way (only selling OTC to MMs and VCs), with a huge asterisks on that if the foundation provided liquidity on DEXs (especially those they built themselves) or other places directly.

EOS had a fair sale to everyone that was deemed a security and the illegal sale was settled with SEC. From a legal perspective preferential fundraises don't really have any impact on whether the asset is a security when the coin and network is actually live. If the ETH ICO was sold only to VCs at first but was Ethereum was still able to decentralize in the same way it did (debatable if it *could* do that the same way still, but just for sake of argument let's say it could) the likelihood of it being a security would be the same as it is today.\n\n> From a tech perspective, why did ETH go through all the hassle of maximally decentralized staking only to become dPOS through pools?\n\nTo the extent that it has, it's due to poor mechanism design imo, and the fact that devs did not have the foresight to plan for a canonical liquid staking solution","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>That&#39;s not what that you think it means.
