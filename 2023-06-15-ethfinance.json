I have thought we've bottomed on sentiment a few times (e.g. post FTX), but I believe we're seeing it more visibly in the daily than I have noticed before. Is this as far as it goes? \n\nThe reasons for the poor sentiment make sense: people are under more pressure financially than they were 2 years ago, there is an ongoing and concerted attempt to eradicate access to crypto in the largest economy in the world, and there is yet to emerge a large  and non-speculative use case in the space. \n\nIn my opinion, more than anything else, it is the non-speculative use cases that crypto needs. We can see and appreciate the advances being made in the tech side of the space, but we still don't see much usage that can't be described as \"a casino\". So where would it come from?  The prime candidates usually stated are things like, identity, gaming, and some kind of enterprise level service such as the stuff EY are working on (i recommend watching their recent keynote). But right now, given seemingly entrenched sentiment and current complexity of UX I do not expect any kind of consumer facing crypto app to find mass adoption. I used to work for a fintech, and i can tell you that a surprising proportion of the population find the UIs of bank accounts to be confusing. Anything requiring something more complex than a username and password will not easily gain mass adoption.  We have all noted the success of Lido (in terms of product adoption), this is primarily due to the ease of UX that they offer. \n\nWith respect to B2B use cases this is where i think there remains most untested opportunity. UX is not a concern as long as the value of the proposition is undeniable. How much money can a company save or make via usage of some enterprise level service? How big is the market for these use cases? Who is building these services? These are the questions i'd like to understand better as ultimately this is where you would expect free markets to function well. If company \"A\" can gain cost or margin advantage over competitor \"B\" via usage of a blockchain, they will. Does sentiment affect the decision makers in these companies? Likely yes but their decision making will be more objective than consumers, many of whom currently wouldn't touch something associated with the word \"crypto\". \n\nOver the long term there is a trend towards efficiency in order to maximise profit amongst companies, and as long as the guarantees of blockchains offer this then long term crypto usage will increase and mass adoption will happen. This, much more than consumer adoption, is why I've bought ETH and why i'm still bullish long term. Detractors often argue \"you can do it already with a database and an API\", while this is true i am arguing that we've not yet seen an offering that serves the total use case, and that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sentiment seems incredibly bad right now.

I just worry those will be few and far between as trends change.\n\nI do also have good teammates, so lucky there. It's just one of those things where our role has very limited client interaction and even internally fairly silo'd off. Not like shove them down in the broom closet type stuff, but I have like maybe 2-4 team meetings a month. Maybe 1 client call every other week. Mostly emails and project work. All to say the type of job that attracts introverts like myself. Personalities vary and people chit chat, but it's no surprise like 90% of the people are 100% remote. So it just feels pointless given maybe I spend 1 to 2 hours a week actually talking to co-workers about work. Maybe another half hour a day talking about non-sense. Half my group doesn't even work in my office anyway... I have enough friends and I don't want to rise of the ladder, so networking and all that is meaningless to me. \n\nBleh, rambling... but yeah I know it varies person by person. It just sucks when that choice is lost because people 4 levels above I've never met want to see more faces in the office or are annoyed they are paying a mortgage on an empty building.

So I&#39;m glad you bring that up as it&#39;s a good point. </p>\n\n<p>I still think I&#39;ll keep my eyes open for other opportunities if they can be full remote... I just worry those will be few and far between as trends change.</p>\n\n<p>I do also have good teammates, so lucky there. It&#39;s just one of those things where our role has very limited client interaction and even internally fairly silo&#39;d off. Not like shove them down in the broom closet type stuff, but I have like maybe 2-4 team meetings a month. Maybe 1 client call every other week. Mostly emails and project work. All to say the type of job that attracts introverts like myself. Personalities vary and people chit chat, but it&#39;s no surprise like 90% of the people are 100% remote. So it just feels pointless given maybe I spend 1 to 2 hours a week actually talking to co-workers about work. Maybe another half hour a day talking about non-sense. Half my group doesn&#39;t even work in my office anyway...
