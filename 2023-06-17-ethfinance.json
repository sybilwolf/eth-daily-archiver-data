They were playing Halo 5 and I went to do a split-screen match with them and we couldn&#39;t do it. Found out it&#39;s not an option - which is wild to me since Halo was one of the early series to push split-screen &amp; LAN on consoles. So I gave them a copy of my old Halo games, so much simpler then the alternative... had a digital version been a thing back then.</p>\n\n<p>Books, fair point. Although I think a caveat here is books are a physical media turned digital, where games are inherently a digital media. To you point though, I should be more optimistic. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have been a bit insulated from the other gaming industry shenanigans like micropayments because my son still doesn&#39;t have his own phone and needs my password to buy stuff on the Apple store (or for his Switch) but I think I need to be more aware as he gets more seriously into gaming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you take anything from this discussion / todays daily... please, I beg of you, look into some of that stuff before it&#39;s too late. I&#39;ve had discussions with others in the past and I often fail to get across how much more predatory it is than when we were growing up. I&#39;m sure you can get a sense of it, but you&#39;d be surprised at how it&#39;s evolved. It&#39;s far beyond the discussion of &quot;is it worth paying $5 for a skin?&quot; and into the relm of blantant lying. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll maybe try to find a good video later. It&#39;s scary and disgusting, especially considering the demographic. A quick example for context, but there is a lot of stuff where they will say it&#39;s a 1/100 change. But it&#39;s programmed to literally happen on the 100th roll. So while that is technically true, it&#39;s not like there are people who get it on roll 2 or something. Along with programming it so content creators get better rolls since they know all the fans of them watch it.  It&#39;s yucky.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-17 11:44:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"johz1dk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14bhuxo","parent_id":"t1_johws7o","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"Thank you I\u2019ll do my research","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you I\u2019ll do my research</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-17 12:39:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"joi5xom","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14bhuxo","parent_id":"t1_johz1dk","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Nervous_Yak_2538","body":"Hi-jacking the thread slightly but speaking of patient gaming plus noting your profile pic...
