A large transaction that spends a lot of gas but then ends with a send to an OFAC-sanctioned address wastes resources on nodes that try to censor. They have to run through all the compute for 99% of the transaction, but then have to discard it in the end with no real way of knowing in advance that the tx would have to be censored. Spam the mempool with a bunch of those transactions and you bring censoring nodes to their knees. This kind of attack has long been used as an argument as to why censorship on Ethereum is technically challenging, or even unfeasible, to implement on a large scale.\n\nThe authors list another attack (as a variant, though it's pretty different) in which a malicious proposer can spam MEV-Boost infrastructure with high value transactions, but instead publish their own block with a transaction that makes the spam tx's invalid, wasting the builders' efforts. Discussion below.\n\n**MemPurge** is possibly more interesting because it doesn't depend on censoring nodes as an attack vector. An attacker constructs a chain of transactions from the same address, so each has a different nonce. Each one looks to be very valuable (paying a high gas price) and seems valid at first glance (so worth keeping in the mempool). They broadcast these transactions in *reverse* nonce order, and the last one broadcast (w/ the lowest nonce, to be executed first) sends all the funds to some other address, retroactively making the entire chain invalid as the sender can't afford the gas. But given that nodes have a limited size mempool, a large chain of transactions which *seem* valuable (but are actually not) can cause eviction of actual legitimate transactions.\n\n~~Interestingly, this was mitigated in [Geth v1.11.4](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.11.4)~~ Mistake on my part, it was DETER that was mitigated. This one remains in the wild.\n\n**GhostTX** seems to be a very specific exploit that depends on there being a discrepancy between the censoring validation logic used by Flashbots' mev-boost-relay code, and the public API that Flashbots provides to give searchers a way to check if a given transaction *would* be censored *if* it were to be submitted. So not at all related to the Ethereum protocol; I'd say this is just a bug with Flashbots' code, which I assume they've fixed by now (and non-censoring relays were never vulnerable). As a side note, I don't see a citation for Eq. 1 and haven't heard of searchers being assigned an automated numerical \"reputation score\", but I don't know much at all about the builder/searcher side of things.\n\n----\n\nSo *ConditionalExhaust* is an actual concern if regulations reach a point where Ethereum nodes become forced to censor transactions, but it's not exactly a new idea (the formalization is nice though). It's irrelevant to non-censoring nodes, and the numbers they cite for censorship on Ethereum are way out of date. The *ConditionalExhaust MEV-Boost variant* is something I think MEV-Boost builders will want to be robust against but shouldn't have large-scale impact. *MemPurge* (now that I understand it) stands out as a practical exploit; hope a good mitigation can be developed. *GhostTX* was an exploit of a Flashbots bug with limited scope that should have been an easy quick fix.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Did a quick read of the paper, thought it was interesting and academically useful, though some of the attacks have limited practical implication.
