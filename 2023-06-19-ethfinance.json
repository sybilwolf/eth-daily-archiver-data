Maybe you are DCAing now, maybe you are trying very hard not to liquidate your underwater positions, maybe you are just trying not to think too hard about the payin of the last 18 months. Whatever it is, now is the time to start with a plan what you would do with your crypto positions if the price rises again in the next years. Doing it in the time of bear is great as you might not have an oveinflated price target which easily happens in the bull. Squishchaos target of 150k ETH anyone? Planing now makes your plan more reasonable.\n\nHow do you make such a plan? There was some discussion here a few months ago with some great insights: [Yeopaa comments on Daily General Discussion - April 5, 2023](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12c90ok/daily_general_discussion_april_5_2023/jf0vkuj/)\n\nI personally set up a level in total crypto net worth I start selling small portions. From this level onward I sell a quarter of the net worth increase for every about 10 percent increase. On a second level I just sell all the increase into stables and keep some in the crypto system and move some out.\n\nThe level I set starts slightly above the last all time high. I think it is a bit too early to sell right then, but this first level is around a time when the market is not too frothy just yet and therefore I can do that sell with a calmer mindset. If I try to do the first sell in the middle of the bubbly bull market it makes it much harder to actually sell and not just delay it a day more and the another one and so on, which leads to you never selling anything.\n\nThe second level for me is around 12k per ETH. I plan to sell all crypto net worth above that level directly into stables.\n\nIs this the perfect plan? I am not so sure myself, but a similar plan worked pretty well for me in the 2021 market. I also had some other plans back then which did not work out so well, so I stick to the parts that worked.\n\nIn the last bull I still had a ton of altcoins and some BTC and ETH ETFs from the 2017 market which I wanted to get rid off anyway. So I set some more specific levels to sell those off. ETFs went first and then the Alts. This also made it easier for me to start selling as I was still keeping my more precious coins.\n\nBy the way, do not get me wrong I am not advising anyone to sell their holdings. You do you. Maybe you optimise for passive crypto income, I have that as well. Maybe you are only thinking with a very long term horizon and it is DCAing for you for the next 20 years. The only thing I am suggesting is that now is the perfect time to think about the next years, before you are blinded by the expectations of the next bull market. The pain you might be feeling now and the plans you are doing now will make you more grounded if things get frothy again.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A PSA:</p>\n\n<p>Now is the perfect time to think about what you want to do with all the wealth you have in ETH or other crypto positions.

Kind of like exiting the Matrix.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I&#39;m sitting here reading about prices and detailed, multi-paragraph posts about exit strategies at $5K or $12K or $100K... and I&#39;m like bitch, I&#39;m never selling. The pain that I went though hodling this shit for years makes any fiat price irrelevant. If I can live off of my staking rewards, good, but I&#39;ve long now separated my personal crypto economy from my fiat economy, and it&#39;s the best decision I&#39;ve made.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-19 09:19:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jopxbic","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14d4z2j","parent_id":"t1_jop2xvy","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Yeopaa","body":"[I'm nobody. ](https://youtu.be/WKozetTrAGk)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/WKozetTrAGk\">I&#39;m nobody. </a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-19 05:51:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jop5grf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14d4z2j","parent_id":"t1_jop2xvy","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-19 06:06:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jop75pr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14d4z2j","parent_id":"t1_jop2xvy","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/MrVodnik","body":"https://youtu.be/h6fcK_fRYaI","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/h6fcK_fRYaI\">https://youtu.be/h6fcK_fRYaI</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-19 06:52:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jopcplg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14d4z2j","parent_id":"t1_jop75pr","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/qwed113","body":"Is Coinbase still safe to use for purchasing and selling coins as long as I don\u2019t store them in their wallet?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is Coinbase still safe to use for purchasing and selling coins as long as I don\u2019t store them in their wallet?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-19 20:41:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"josg8k3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14d4z2j","parent_id":"t3_14d4z2j","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/alexiskef","body":"yes!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>yes!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-19 20:45:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"josgn3r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14d4z2j","parent_id":"t1_josg8k3","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/viners","body":"Instead of having a fixed deposit amount required for staking, why not just sort the list of validators by amount deposited, include the top ones, and the others are deactivated until they deposit more? 1m or so validators in the top list.
