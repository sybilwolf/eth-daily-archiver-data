I think this question is great and deserves more attention, it deserves a more in-depth answer and definitely also input from others (you!). But let me start with extended thoughts: \n\nFirst let's start with \"projects that stand out\" = the status quo of L2 today: \n\n\\- First of all there are L2s as necessary scaling solutions for the ETH ecosystem. The need is obvious and optimistic roll-ups are out there with ARB and OP (and their corresponding tokens) at the front. zk roll-ups are following, most are still testnets only, but some are live on mainnet. \n\nRight now it feels like optimistic roll-ups are in the lead. They were launched earlier and have attracted both developers and users. ARB seems to be the biggest and most active ecosystem (60% market share wrt TVL according to [l2beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl)). I think both ARB and OP are good L2s if you want to explore execution layers, even if they have airdropped tokens already and the financial incentive is low. \n\nWhen it comes to zk roll-ups right now only zksync Era is really relevant. It has launched on mainnet, it's working, it really feels fast and a defi ecosystem is developing. One issue are the fees, that don't feel as low as they should be to be honest. As stated several times the past days Starknet doesn't feel good. It's slow, it's not cheaper and because of the alpha status there's not a lot going on. Even defi protocols that have launched are limiting usage (e.g. via max allocations/ address). \n\nOn top I would really recommend paying attention = playing around on testnets. There are still a lot of zk RU that haven't launched, but have a clear roadmap for mainnet. To name a few, there is Scroll, Taiko and Linea. \n\n\\- On many L2s I see the same things happening: Most L2 have the major defi apps like Uni, AAVE, Curve. On top there is a \"L2 native\" defi ecosystem. Most L2s have additional AMMs and borrowing and lending protocols, but as far as I can tell those are mostly similar to defi 1.0 protocols. \n\n\\- One (incremental) innovation we are seeing on L2s is orderbook based DEXes, which are obv only new onchain. Most of the time these offer perps and no spot trading. Also the counterparty is mostly a liquidity pool that we know from Uniswap pools. These new DEXes are a result of cheaper fees on L2 that make these innovations possible (of course they were possible on L1 as well, but not economically viable). \n\n\\- A necessary innovation were bridges. There's a lot of competition and like a year ago (?) or so the \"infra narrative\" was hot. We use them regularly, they are most of the time the cheapest (on and off ramp to L2s) and in many cases the fastest way to off ramp (in the case of optimistic RU). There are some differences, e.g. no bridge features all the L2s I use regularly, sometimes swaps are possible, sending to a different address is optional. Bridge tokens are not really taking off. E.g. hop (which seems to be every devs favorite, caused it's forked for most L2 testnets) has a market cap of 4M (FDV 62M). \n\n\\- One very cool innovation is Lens protocol and decentralized social media. I think this is a huge step, it's built by the AAVE team/ founders who have delivered in the past. The whitelist of course is an issue and if you use e.g. lenster regularly you will see that it is still buggy. So it's early, but the general idea is - as we have experienced with reddit in the past couple of weeks - great. \n\nSo what's necessary for a protocol to take off next cycle? Innovation and a USP that results in usage and hype. \n\nL2s feel like winners, and I don't think I would really make a difference between optimistic roll-ups and zk roll-ups *for this cycle*. I think there is a consensus that longterm zk roll-ups will win the L2 market, because they don't have the 7day waiting period for withdrawals (which obviously isn't really important with bridges that allow you to leave more or less instantly) and have better mechanics to lower fees down the road (if I understand the tech correctly). I expect a L2 season at some point during the next cycle and would be surprised if that rising tide doesn't lift all the boats. And yeah, we all expected L2 summer last year already... so maybe we are all wrong, or this is kinda obvious, but the timing is harder to predict. I think this is like defi last cycle. Defi was the obvious use case for Ethereum, L2 is the obvious scaling solution for Ethereum.  \n\nDisclaimer: I have received ARB and OP airdrops and I haven't sold a single token and was actually long OP for some time, but closed it at 2.20 USD or so. I am not planning to sell these tokens within the next 12 months and will probably hold them longer than that. If there is another capitulation that feels like March 2020 I might go long again and even with a time based capitulation I think going long at one point is an option I will evaluate again. The same applies for a potential zksync/ starknet/ etc. airdrop. Will hold them all (and potentially add more) for the bigger part of this cycle. So I won't pick one \"winner\", but naturally diversify into all L2 tokens. \n\nI think for L2 defi protocols this will be hard. There is so much competition and while there is innovation and also some hype (e.g. GMX as one of the earlier and more successful ones on ARB, probably also because of it's revenue share model --> \"real yield\") I think it will be hard to predict winners in that category. I think the same applies for bridges. They are fundamental, but not really sexy, but once L2s / L2 tokens take off, bridges could be a proxy to invest with a good risk/reward, mainly because of low mcaps. \n\nLens is innovative and unique, hence could be a winner, but you can't really invest right now. Only option for now would be a 0.1 ETH invest in a lens-profile/ NFT hoping for an airdrop. Still I think trying to get a whitelist spot and invest time digging for opportunities to mint a profile is probably a smart move. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time I feel like the biggest winners aren't out there yet or are hidden (at least for me). It's going to be innovation no one expects like UNI last cycle with a revolutionary innovation like AMMs. I feel NFTs and PFPs also did fall into that category. These will most likely pop-up in the first months of the bull market. As I said yesterday, maybe it's gonna be something with RWA (though that was a hyped narrative at some point in the past as well). If that's the case I think that would be huge, since RWA would create a valid use case and connect on- and offchain in a way we haven't seen yet and I think the criticism that \"we are only exchanging/ dumping imaginary internet moneyz without any value\" needs to be countered with actual legit use cases. \n\nBut since I love predictions (as you have probably noticed by now) , I will try to pick the winners of next cycle based on gut feeling: \"MEV protocols\". MEV is a huge \"industry\" and I think there is a lot of space for innovation and there are a lot of approaches to \"solve\" MEV (it can't really be solved, but the entity that's profiting the most can change and I expect the users that create MEV will profit the most). This winner could be flashbots (with SUAVE), but there are probably more solutions being developed right now (also some that have launched, e.g. FOLD?). I am really looking forward to see how this develops. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but again, I think this question yesterday was great, cause it helped me structure my thoughts, experiences and thesis for next cycle and I think that's worth a lot. So thank you, hanniabu!\n\nNow I wanna see some more people summarize their experiences and thoughts :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So yesterday <a href=\"/u/hanniabu\">u/hanniabu</a> in a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14e1fzr/comment/joszks6/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">thread</a> asked me the following</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any projects you&#39;ve seen that stand out as potential winners for next cycle?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I answered the question yesterday, but only with a few bullets and I kept thinking about it for the whole day.
