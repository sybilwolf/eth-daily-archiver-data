This is why they have soft forks. I don't think Bitcoin is capable of hard forking at this point and it will die with the 21 cap.\n\nAgree. Going back to my original post in this thread, I've been arguing my point that \"lack of smart contracts wouldn't have necessarily been a show-stopper\" from the perspective of an idealized progression of blockchain technology, where Bitcoin incorporated every new blockchain technology except that smart contracts were never invented. But your view, of course, does a good job of describing the actual state of Bitcoin.\n\n> Ethereum is capable of scaling because it has smart contracts\n\nI don't believe that's true, see prior point. Smart contracts are not strictly necessary for a blockchain to scale - any kind of scaling you could do with smart contracts, the core developers could theoretically enshrine directly into the protocol as an official protocol feature. The benefit of smart contract based scaling is to allow third party dev teams to compete to code scaling solutions, rather than having only the single core dev team able to work on them.\n\n> There's also something to do with your stablecoins on Ethereum (like swap, lend, borrow, etc.) These are simply NOT possible on Bitcoin today without a HF or some sort of centralized workaround. \n\nSwaps are relatively easy to implement on Bitcoin with a soft fork that declares a new order book transaction type. No hard fork required. In fact I'm a little surprised I haven't heard anyone talk about this, but I'm not too tuned into the Bitcoin dev community anymore.\n\nBorrowing is a much bigger challenge, as it requires much more opinionated designs that would need to enshrine subjective concepts like relative expected volatility and safe liquidation thresholds. Theoretically they would also be possible with a soft fork, but in practice they might be impossible to implement properly. It would need price oracles too which on first thought seem impossible, but on second thought maybe you could repurpose the swap feature as a price oracle.\n\n> But still so far, among the only true innovations in crypto so far has been developed all on Ethereum (smart contracts, true PoS, zero knowledge tech, L2s, etc. etc.).\n\nI would give the zero knowledge tech innovation crown to Zcash, personally. Ethereum's work with zero knowledge tech has felt more incremental to me (though generalized zk-rollups do have big future potential).\n\nEthereum has definitely pioneered the rest on your list, though.\n\n> Anyways, I am enjoying the back and fourth because it does force me to think through my positions.\n\nMe too, it's great discussing this with you.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I think the best currencies are fiat because they are centralized and have the ability to change issuance on demand in order to react to economic conditions. IMO this is necessary for currency stability as market cycles are just emergent from human behavior and inhernetly unpredictable. So I am very bearish on native cryptos being used as currency. Much more likely that we continue with stablecoins / CBDCs only onchain. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree with you that native cryptocurrency tokens are not currencies and will probably not replace fiat currencies (if anything imo they have the potential to spawn additional fiat currencies through regulatory arbitrage).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This architecture simply cannot scale</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe Bitcoin could add native roll-ups with no more than a soft fork. No change to existing transaction types or chain structures would need to be made.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem hasn&#39;t been a lack of good ideas with Bitcoin, it&#39;s a complete lack of governance and this notion of a Bitcoin &quot;virgin birth&quot; where the protocol cannot be changed and people must find technological solutions. This is why they have soft forks. I don&#39;t think Bitcoin is capable of hard forking at this point and it will die with the 21 cap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Agree. Going back to my original post in this thread, I&#39;ve been arguing my point that &quot;lack of smart contracts wouldn&#39;t have necessarily been a show-stopper&quot; from the perspective of an idealized progression of blockchain technology, where Bitcoin incorporated every new blockchain technology except that smart contracts were never invented. But your view, of course, does a good job of describing the actual state of Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ethereum is capable of scaling because it has smart contracts</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s true, see prior point. Smart contracts are not strictly necessary for a blockchain to scale - any kind of scaling you could do with smart contracts, the core developers could theoretically enshrine directly into the protocol as an official protocol feature. The benefit of smart contract based scaling is to allow third party dev teams to compete to code scaling solutions, rather than having only the single core dev team able to work on them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&#39;s also something to do with your stablecoins on Ethereum (like swap, lend, borrow, etc.) These are simply NOT possible on Bitcoin today without a HF or some sort of centralized workaround. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Swaps are relatively easy to implement on Bitcoin with a soft fork that declares a new order book transaction type. No hard fork required. In fact I&#39;m a little surprised I haven&#39;t heard anyone talk about this, but I&#39;m not too tuned into the Bitcoin dev community anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Borrowing is a much bigger challenge, as it requires much more opinionated designs that would need to enshrine subjective concepts like relative expected volatility and safe liquidation thresholds. Theoretically they would also be possible with a soft fork, but in practice they might be impossible to implement properly. It would need price oracles too which on first thought seem impossible, but on second thought maybe you could repurpose the swap feature as a price oracle.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But still so far, among the only true innovations in crypto so far has been developed all on Ethereum (smart contracts, true PoS, zero knowledge tech, L2s, etc. etc.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would give the zero knowledge tech innovation crown to Zcash, personally.
