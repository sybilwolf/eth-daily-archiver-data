Availability is one of the most important properties blockchains provide and it's critical for certain types of use cases. I don't see a nice path forward to recuperate the availability guarantees in an L2 without re-incurring a lot of the same costs that the L1 has, which perhaps means that any use case that is sensitive to availability guarantees will forever be tied to the L1. This is good and bad. Good because some use cases will inherently be tied to the L1, so these will always be native users of the L1, hence transaction revenues/security budget, etc...

As any meme, it's an oversimplification of the reality with the purpose of maximizing how easy it's to spread. I get that. I also get that it was born as a response to the even more stupid meme of Bitcoin is sound money because 21M. But in my opinion it has gone a step too far in oversimplifying the economics of ETH and it may come back to bite us. It has been oversimplified to mean deflationary issuance, to the point people celebrate when ETH is deflationary and get worried when it stops being so. This is wrong. ETH is not inherently deflationary, nor inflationary. In fact, the underlying model is even more beautiful, ETH's economics are adaptive. It allows the market to find equilibriums for total circulating supply, yield, security, and price of ETH. This is even more amazing because you don't need to tinker parameters (cue the Fed raising or lowering interest rates) in a quarterly fashion to adapt to the economic conditions or have a fixed issuance schedule that breaks when you don't have sufficient security budget. The market does the hard job and discovers all those equilibriums for you, the monetary policy sets the right incentives to ensure those equilibriums exist. This is what the ultrasound money should be about. Ultrasound monetary policy. I know it's less catchy, won't spread as easily. But we won't need to pivot when the oversimplified memes are proved to be wrong. \nIf ETH is successful, it will inevitably exit the deflationary regime and become inflationary. Because what makes ETH inflationary or deflationary is the interplay between those equilibriums. If ETH succeeds and acquires monetary premium then that's because it's being acquired above its natural usage levels. Gold has monetary premium because it's not being bought to be used in electronics or industrial processes, it's being bought above these levels to store it. The usage of ETH is to feed the EVM as fuel, burning it in the process. If ETH is being created above its consumption levels then it's inflationary. A successful ETH future looks like: low yield, slightly inflationary, high price given its usage.\n\n- I'm concerned with EigenLayer's unknown unknowns. I cannot put the finger on anything concrete. But I have seen plenty of situations where leverage came back to bite in economics to be very cautious. And EigenLayer is a leveraged play over an L1's security. We tend to be very bad at estimating long-tail risks and that's when leveraged plays blow out. Tread carefully. I'm hoping its adoption is small and cautious, until we have a very well understood idea of all its risks.\n\n- Not ETH related but something Vitalik is very interested in, so perhaps some of you have paid attention to it.

Data availability is a problem for L2s. However there are solutions that help this problem, like data availability sampling which allows nodes to store far less of all of the data, but still have network wide coverage of the data, and these same techniques could be implemented in L2s such that they can \"enshrine\" L1s DA. \n\nSecond paragraph: Agree with all of this. Issuance is meant to fluctuate according to market demand. We'll start seeing risk on / risk off events. When  staking yield is low and lots of peopel are staking, then you'll see people chase yields in riskier assets like DeFi. This will in turn increase the staking yield as more capital flees, until there's another turning point where participants flee DeFi back to staking. Very similar to how markets work with interest rates today.\n\nThird paragraph: Agreed. EigenLayer is interesting, and could be an incredible oppertunity to strengthen Ethereums security, but it's also very complex and could introduce unintended behavior in validator participants.\n\nFourth paragraph: Somewhat agree, however, prolonging life expectancy is about making older adults healthier for longer. Will this have all sorts of consequences on society? Yes, absolutely. But these will play out over relatively long timeframes and humans are great at adapting. No doubt that society will change drastically if this were to occur, but I hope it would change for the better.\n\nThese don't seem like unpopular opinions to me.

However there are solutions that help this problem, like data availability sampling which allows nodes to store far less of all of the data, but still have network wide coverage of the data, and these same techniques could be implemented in L2s such that they can &quot;enshrine&quot; L1s DA. </p>\n\n<p>Second paragraph: Agree with all of this. Issuance is meant to fluctuate according to market demand. We&#39;ll start seeing risk on / risk off events. When  staking yield is low and lots of peopel are staking, then you&#39;ll see people chase yields in riskier assets like DeFi. This will in turn increase the staking yield as more capital flees, until there&#39;s another turning point where participants flee DeFi back to staking. Very similar to how markets work with interest rates today.</p>\n\n<p>Third paragraph: Agreed. EigenLayer is interesting, and could be an incredible oppertunity to strengthen Ethereums security, but it&#39;s also very complex and could introduce unintended behavior in validator participants.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth paragraph: Somewhat agree, however, prolonging life expectancy is about making older adults healthier for longer.
