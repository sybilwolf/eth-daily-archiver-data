You can\u2019t go to a doctor with an easily curable disease, look at the absurd pricing, and decide to die instead to stick it to the man, in the same way you could cut out almost any other luxury in your life if the price was absurd enough. </p>\n\n<p>The only solutions are to either get rid of it altogether (\u201csingle payer system\u201d), or artificially introduce a large insurer that\u2019s not allowed to make a profit, and therefore can undercut the private insurers, providing real competition so their investors don\u2019t get so fat. These economic incentives are why I\u2019ve really come around on public option health insurance over the years.
