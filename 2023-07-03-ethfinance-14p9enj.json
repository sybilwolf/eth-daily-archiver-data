There's a good outline of it here if you're out of the loop: https://proton.me/blog/online-safety-bill\n\nTL;DR: \n\n>The Online Safety Bill is currently working its way through the UK parliament, and it\u2019s expected to be passed into law this autumn. This wide-reaching piece of legislation would force any \u201cuser-to-user service\u201d (such as TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter) or search engine that\u2019s available online in the UK to protect all its users from illegal content and children from potentially harmful content.\n\n>Clause 110 of the Online Safety Bill would allow the UK government to require any \u201cuser-to-user service\u201d to use \u201caccredited technology\u201d to identify and remove child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or terrorist content \u201cwhether communicated publicly or privately by means of the service\u201d. \n\n>In plain English, clause 110 would give the UK government broad powers that would allow it to require any online service available in the UK to monitor all user-generated content on its platform, including its users\u2019 private messages. \n\n>This is a problem for end-to-end encrypted services, which can\u2019t access their users\u2019 content. \n\n>While UK lawmakers have stated they don\u2019t want to ban end-to-end encryption, the only ways an end-to-end encrypted service could comply with the bill are:\n\n>- Remove its end-to-end encryption\n\n>- Weaken its end-to-end encryption\n\n>- Install client-side scanning\n\n>- Cease providing service in the UK\n\n>UPDATE March 6, 2023: Removed a reference to the Online Safety Bill applying to \u201clarge\u201d companies. In fact, it would apply to companies of all sizes, placing a large technical burden on many medium-sized and small businesses.\n\nI find this extremely concerning. Apps like Signal and WhatsApp have pledged not to weaken their encryption for such legislation and Signal will straight up leave the UK.\n\nRegarding my personal situation, my lovely girlfriend lives in the UK and I am finishing a degree in NZ for the next year. After that, I plan to move to live with her since she isn't really able to move to NZ in the next few years but long term is a different story. But I genuinely don't want to move to the UK if this goes in to force and it's either illegal to use encrypted messaging apps or not possible to privately communicate with Brits. I know that might seem extreme and I realise that it would be naive to assume such legislation would never come to NZ but for now that's not the case. Plus of course it seems like Apple and Google want to implement client side scanning anyway.\n\nBut for me, privacy is a hill worth dying on (well not literally but it's worth fighting hard for and moving to a quiet place in the middle of nowhere for). The way I see it, you cannot have a free democratic society without privacy. Though there may be a slight caveat for if the surveillance tools involve open source client side scanning with transparent and effective detection software but let's face it, that's not how it will be done. There are already too many stories of false positives and cases of guilty until proven innocent and it's clear that legislators are either too stupid to understand the technical problems with backdooring encryption or are malicious and just want more surveillance.\n\nI've got nothing to hide. If you visit me in person you're more than welcome to go through all of my private messages and emails as long as you're only looking at them with your own eyes. I genuinely don't care. But I do care about people being able to hide perfectly normal things if they need to- it's human nature. Plus, in a democracy, there will be things you need to hide to prevent malicious capture of the government by bad actors. This means privacy is worth it even if it means criminals will hide things too (though they'll do that regardless of if there is mass surveillance or not- only normal people lose if legislation like this passes).\n\nAm I going insane or is the average Joe too distracted, complacent and/or stupid to realise how big of an issue such legislation is?\n\nOh, and if you disagree with me, I'd love to hear why. Having strong opinions is pretty stupid if you're never open to criticism and dissent.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Do any Brits want to weigh in on the Online Safety Bill which is getting closer and closer to passing?

We paved the road but did not invent the car yet. Or we deployed an electric grid but the light bulb is yet to be invented. \n\nIt seems counter intuitive when you compare it to the older industrial innovations where we first invent a process or a mechanism and then we work on infrastructure for scaling and deployment.\n\nBut when compared to more recent digital innovation, there are more examples of first deploying an infrastructure to allow the use case and end products to flourish: the internet was deployed with very limited use cases at first: mainly email and other basic text exchange. Most people were like - meh what is that ?\nDeployment of mass use cases came decades later !\n\nThe iPhone example is a bit more intricated since it was both a new product and a new infrastructure (SDK+Appstore). The former aspect caught early interest, the latter came to fruition later on when developers started to deploy actual use cases as Apps.\nApple tries to reproduce that with the Vision, but faces trouble since consumers are less attracted by the product aspect yet, and no actual use cases are yet ready.\n\nI am pretty convinced that crypto could enable a broad new class of applications.

We paved the road but did not invent the car yet. Or we deployed an electric grid but the light bulb is yet to be invented. </p>\n\n<p>It seems counter intuitive when you compare it to the older industrial innovations where we first invent a process or a mechanism and then we work on infrastructure for scaling and deployment.</p>\n\n<p>But when compared to more recent digital innovation, there are more examples of first deploying an infrastructure to allow the use case and end products to flourish: the internet was deployed with very limited use cases at first: mainly email and other basic text exchange.
