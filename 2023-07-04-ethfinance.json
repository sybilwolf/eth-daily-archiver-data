With this small window and an overloaded server that could not process all requests in time, you can imagine the frustration that this caused current holders. Also, the artwork for the new Elementals collection was revealed to be very similar to the original Azukis, leading many to question the purpose of this new mint: if you can have an Elemental for 1ETH, why buy an Azuki for 8, when they look almost the same?

In a recent conference call with VIPs, the team emphasized their intention to deliver an immersive experience, building a vast IP with Elementals to draw in a wider community. They announced the production of an anime series tied to the Azuki lore and teased an upcoming project revolving around a new utility token, Green Beans, which would only be available to OG Azuki holders.\n\nThe after-effects of this Azuki fiasco have reached the overall NFT market, which was already in the midst of a bear market, causing panic selling across several collections, and further amplifying the bearish sentiment.
