As an example it can't solve the same types of css problems that it could before. Imagine if you were talking to someone everyday and their iq suddenly dropped 20%, you'd notice.

Chainlink will be used as an enterprise abstraction layer to securely connect the Swift network to the Ethereum Sepolia network, while Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) will enable complete interoperability between the source and destination blockchains.\n\nhttps://www.swift.com/news-events/news/swift-explores-blockchain-interoperability-remove-friction-tokenised-asset-settlement\n\nThis will likely be the future. The utopian world of blockchain purists will be like the Linux purists of today.\n\n>The part of Fidelity\u2019s business headed up by Froehlich focuses on digital assets and only started at the beginning of 2022, but it was the culmination of a long journey into decentralised assets. Not only was Fidelity seeking to enter the digital assets space, it was striving to future-proof its business by preparing for tokenised securities and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) too.\n\n>One way it did this was by examining the tokenisation of some of the fund share classes it offered, and identifying where there was demand in the market, Froehlich says: \u201cIf you think of digital-native investors, which are naturally more adept to digital assets, they are also looking at ways of integrating traditional assets into their portfolio or wallet. Tokenising this asset necessitates a change, an upgrade in our infrastructure, which is another area that I'm focusing on. So it's both this convergence from client demand and need for an upgraded infrastructure that led to the decision to dedicate resources to this topic.\u201d\n\nhttps://fintechmagazine.com/company-reports/how-fidelity-brings-digital-assets-to-institutional-clients","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Global financial messaging service provider Swift collaborated on the project to support \u201cinteroperability across the international financial ecosystem,\u201d the NY Fed added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically it&#39;s a private/permissioned blockchain trial. You can then connect that to some of SWIFT&#39;s other work:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our next set of industry experiments is designed to show how Swift\u2019s infrastructure can be leveraged to facilitate interoperability, enabling tokenised value to be transferred between existing systems and both public and private DLT platforms with existing connectivity, standards, and messaging.</p>\n\n<p>The first use case will involve the transfer of tokenised assets between two wallets on the same public blockchain network (Ethereum Sepolia testnet). <strong>The second involves the transfer of tokenised assets from a public blockchain (Ethereum) to a permissioned blockchain.</strong> And a third use case will test the transfer of tokenised assets from Ethereum to another public blockchain. Chainlink will be used as an enterprise abstraction layer to securely connect the Swift network to the Ethereum Sepolia network, while Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) will enable complete interoperability between the source and destination blockchains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/swift-explores-blockchain-interoperability-remove-friction-tokenised-asset-settlement\">https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/swift-explores-blockchain-interoperability-remove-friction-tokenised-asset-settlement</a></p>\n\n<p>This will likely be the future.

Not only was Fidelity seeking to enter the digital assets space, it was striving to future-proof its business by preparing for tokenised securities and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) too.</p>\n\n<p>One way it did this was by examining the tokenisation of some of the fund share classes it offered, and identifying where there was demand in the market, Froehlich says: \u201cIf you think of digital-native investors, which are naturally more adept to digital assets, they are also looking at ways of integrating traditional assets into their portfolio or wallet. Tokenising this asset necessitates a change, an upgrade in our infrastructure, which is another area that I&#39;m focusing on.
