This is akin to things like [tvtropes](https://tvtropes.org/) for writers or software patterns for programming but this in particular applies to coordination. I call the set of anti-patterns Moloch's Toolbox. These are qualitative criteria amongst actors in an ecosystem that lead to coordination failures. To anyone unfamiliar, Moloch is anthropomorphized coordination failure. Moloch's toolbox is the means by which this malevolent deity influences human organizations to inevitably fail.\n\nOne pattern I'd like to call out to day has to do with situations where, in game theory terms, there is a [Pareto-optimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) solution that cannot be reached because all actors are stuck in the current [Nash-equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium). If everyone were to move, everyone would be better off but an individual actor moving leads to a suboptimal reward for that actor so no one is willing to make the first move resulting in a suboptimal steady state.\n\nFor example, let's look at the global reserve currency. The reason the dollar became the current world reserve currency is because oil is priced in dollars. So whether you are buying or selling oil, you are using dollars by default. Everyone deals in oil, so the infrastructure was setup to use dollars and then this kind of carried over into everything else. As the US prints its way towards a $200T national debt there may arise a better contender for global reserve currency in the coming decades. But, even if everyone wanted to, everyone is kind of trapped into this system. Change at this point would be difficult because even if everyone wanted to move, there are high costs and risks of being the first to move.\n\nFrom the perspective of an actor in this system, imagine you are a country that wants to reduce your dependence on the US dollar and want to switch to something like the Euro. In theory you could setup a trade deal with another country in that currency for oil but it's kind of like OTC trading; there is less infrastructure for transmittal, fewer banks to rely on, less established regulations, and most importantly less liquidity. Any strategy that doesn't place your oil for sale on the market with the highest liquidity will cost you money. As a seller, you would only want to move to a new base currency for your oil if over half of the global oil sales are there first. The first mover is taking a huge risk, putting in all the effort to address that friction, and losing money on their oil sales. This causes everyone to stay complacent even in bad systems. This is Moloch's tool.\n\nIn web3 we see the equivalent pattern every time a new Dex wants to attract capital. The incentive pattern we have seen for this kind of migration is called a vampire attack. It historically has required someone to put up a large sum of money to compensate those first potential movers. This would not be a viable strategy for the global oil market. However, Sushiswap did something quietly brilliant besides juicing their vampire attack with SUSHI tokens. When it first launched, Uniswap LP holders could deposit their LP tokens in a migration contract. Rather than moving the liquidity to Sushiswap immediately, the contract held the money in escrow until a certain time passed. In this interim period, the liquidity was still on Uniswap, which meant it cost participants nothing to join. This latter part is the coordination breakthrough we should be more interested in.\n\nIn the oil/USD example above we could create an escrow contract that would hold your LP position until a certain criteria is met such as having a critical percentage of the order book in the escrow contract. Then the escrow contract could atomically move everyone at once. This allows everyone to escape the Moloch trap together.\n\nWithout a blockchain, there is no infrastructure for this type of coordination. With smart contracts though we have a moat-breaking technology that enables all of society to advance towards global-optimal solutions. It removes the first-mover disadvantage by enabling atomic coordinated action without a privileged coordinator (arbiter). With the blockchain acting as a incorruptible neutral arbiter to execute the rules, without any risk that this arbiter can run away with the funds or do something devious because the rules are auditable by everyone. Seemingly tiny innovations like this that came out of a greedy vampire attack from a dying exchange are how we are changing the world, one contract at a time. Beauty out of chaos.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As part of my tokenomic consulting work I&#39;m building a kind of meta-inventory of tokenomic patterns and anti-patterns in my head.
