This one is like the inverse of first-mover disadvantage and it's probably the best known pattern of coordination failure. Of course I'm talking about [Tragedy of the Commons](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues). Formally, there is a known Pareto Optimum but each actor is free to defect from that strategy and personally profit by doing so at the expense of all other actors. Common outcomes from this coordination failure are things like nature ecosystem collapses from activities like overfishing, market collapses from raced selling into a price inelastic market, and famine.\n\nBy this definition, there are many examples of things that are not commonly considered \"Commons\" that nevertheless fall into this category of problem such as the famous Prisoner's Dilemma. The \"commons\" in this case is reduced jail time. In this scenario each actor is free to defect from the optimal solution and snitch to the police and reduce their personal prison time while increasing the total prison time. The net result is all actors inevitably defect and the system collapses to the worst possible value (what is the antonym of Pareto optimum called?).\n\nTo correct the incentives you have to change the local calculus of each actor. Recognizing that each actor is likely to locally optimize, you have to add external incentives for complying or external penalties for defecting from the Pareto Optimum. Typical solutions to this problem resemble [fail-deadly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-deadly) deterrence systems which admittedly isn't a source of optimism for humanity. A less seemingly insane variation of this requires that all actors submit to an common arbiter such as a government that makes defecting illegal but this solution breaks down when they don't share a nationality.\n\nLet's look at fixing the prisoner's dilemma as an example. If, prior to the crime, each criminal had to put up a hostage then their local optimum is to risk the longer prison sentence to protect their hostage. They would be willing to do this because they also know this is true of the criminal in the other room so they can rest assured that the other criminal will also comply rather than defect. After they get out of prison with their minimum sentences they can have their hostage back so it ultimately cost them nothing to enter this agreement (the hostage experience notwithstanding).\n\nWhat I like about this solution is that it can be applied as a layer on top of existing systems without having to otherwise change those systems. For example, the criminals can enter this agreement without changing the dynamics between the criminals and the police and can do so without the consent of the police.\n\nThe example above breaks down in two situations:\n\n1) There are actors outside the contract system. In the prisoner's dilemma, what do the criminals do to secure the cooperation of an outside witness? How do you prevent overfishing from countries that refuse to pass or enforce laws preventing ships from their nation from overfishing?\n\n2) The actors have nothing to use as a hostage.\n\nTo address the first case, the hostage you stake has to be something you can weaponize. For example, the criminals could stake a large sum of capital instead of a loved one. As long as the stake can be used to apply negative incentives against external actors somehow, you can use it to fix local incentives. For example, the criminals could make a conditional assassination contract against any witnesses and leak the information about this contract to the witness before they speak to the police or testify in court. This solution can be combined with a dead man's switch so no active actions are required by the criminals to enforce it.\n\nIn the second case, you have to find some kind of negative outcome to enforce. The most common stake-of-last-resort example is the safety or life of the defector. For example, in The Dark Knight, The Joker made each criminal literally implant bombs into themselves. Assuming we can bootstrap reputation systems, reputation is a much saner collateral for less extreme use cases. That's basically all your credit score is when Visa grants you a credit line without collateral. I like the idea of using reputation collateral better than having to implant oracle controlled bombs into everyone before we would have a chance at fighting climate change in any case.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Today I&#39;d like to talk about another tool from <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14sx3ji/daily_general_discussion_july_7_2023/jr21wrm/\">Moloch&#39;s Toolbox</a>.

Think of it like an AMM but rather than buying my ETH, you are buying the LP my ETH will be placed in until the next settlement. This is roughly what they describe with their DAO liquidity marketplace. It is objectively a good idea and I can see why DAOs would prefer to use this over direct Curve or Balancer pool bribes *as CRV rewards wind down*. At the moment though the efficiency of bribes is higher than 1:1 on Curve so participating in this market instead would be less capital efficient for DAOs which is all that matters really (calculate how much CRV issuance you get per bribe on Curve right now).\n\nTheir autopilot (LMP) just sounds like pooled liquidity farming solutions like yearn in principal but with an LMP you are exposed to IL. Basically if you want a risk adjusted return at present you have to swap the assets yourself and find the optimal rate between aura, convex, and yearn yourself. You spend gas moving it around as things shift and it takes time. They are proposing to automate that for a fee which is basically the premise of Yearn. Assuming the take rate is reasonable I'll use this with a portion of my funds. If nothing else all the shifting around I do today incurs taxes which is capital I pay to the IRS and can't compound in the following years. So if they do what is currently my part time investing job well I'll be a loyal customer.\n\nAs for the TOKE token I don't buy tokens based on anticipation regardless of how much I like their plan. I wait for the numbers to point to positive adoption and for the PE I calculate to be underpriced. Basically I want to scoop up bear market depressed assets where the underlying protocol is showing substantial growth and has fundamentals that guarantee a price floor. So it's something I'll keep my eye on.\n\nRegarding TOKEs fundamentals: do I want to be someone's IL insurance? For something like ETH/rETH, maybe? Depends on the rate. But an LMP ends up being split into potentially dozens of places so you're essentially insuring *all of them* **and** the solver itself. That doesn't sound fun to me. I don't want my day job to be a professional underwriter. Fundamentally the yield per TOKE will depend on the ratio of TOKE insuring the pool to the size of the pool. If there were 1:1 $'s insuring vs in the pool (a fully insured pool) the rate would be abysmal. So instead you're going to see like 100:1 LMP TVL to staked TOKE insuring it. Even with a relatively sane fee rate for insurance that might give the staked TOKE a 20%+ APR (denominated in LMP underlying) for the LMP but that's also a direct measure of how fucking risky that position is. I can make 20% holding CRV with a lot less risk. CRV is growing well. crvUSD in particular is growing aggressively. For me to stake TOKE in a new system with as many risks as I see I would need over 100% APR. Practically this means the LMP collateral will be *barely* insured and even minor losses will completely wipe out TOKE stakers. So for me to hold TOKE I would probably want some type of senior tranche (like the accTOKE system). I'm more bullish on the protocol as a user than a TOKE holder from what I see today.\n\nFor anyone curious to dive deeper: https://medium.com/tokemak/tokemak-v2-introducing-lmps-autopilot-and-the-dao-liquidity-marketplace-86b8ec0656a","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve said for over a year now we need a liquidity order book rather than current bribe markets.
