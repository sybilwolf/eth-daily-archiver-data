I  built the machine myself and installed dappnode afterwards. Once it is running it is super convenient and the most hands off solution of them all. It does automatic updates if you want it to, can send notifications over telegram and all in all is a pleasant experience. It now also includes the possibility to start rocketpool minipools, which had (still has?) some issues, so I would recommend to read up on it if you want to use it for rocketpool. Tweaking all settings the way I like them is possible. Setting up dappnode takes some time and is definitely the most time consuming of the three solutions for me, but once it is running it is just great. </p>\n\n<p>The rocketpool, ethstaker and dappnode community are super helpful if you run into any issues.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-10 01:09:49","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-07-10 01:35:04","id":"jrdn6az","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14vk91l","parent_id":"t1_jrdhitl","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/696_eth","body":"Thanks for the info.\n\nI wouldve expected the dappnode to be the easiest, why is it not the case? \n\nAnd just looked over thru eth-docker and idk it doesnt look as easy as I wouldve expected it.

I have started dozens of nodes and probably hundreds of validators (on testnets mostly) using eth-docker. The simplicity of it is a huge advantage for me.\n\nWith dappnode, you install it with a script (or full operating system), then you have to log in via Wifi, change passwords and wifi name, re-login, configure VPN/wireguard (on the dappnode and your PC) and connect through them. Dappnode is special in the way you connect to the node. It is all web based. You connect to the node via the browser. You cannot attach a screen to your dapopnode and configure it.

You have to click through the webui if you want to change anything, which takes quite a bit more time. If you want to check the logs, you cannot do that on the command line you have to connect via Wifi or vpn again, go to the individual packages and check the logs there.

Some of the reasons it takes longer are because you can do more: Having a VPN connection to your home network is great, notifications via telegram are convenient.  \n\nSetting up the validator client with ethdocker took me about half an hour last time I did it.
