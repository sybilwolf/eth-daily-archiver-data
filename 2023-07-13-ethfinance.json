It was quite straightforward:\n\n- Open a Gnosis safe on Gnosis chain (See edit at the end.)\n  \n- Sign up to monerium\n  \n- Link the safe with walletconnect to monerium\n  \n- Do the KYC thingy: picture of ID/Passport and a selfie and some questions about your occupation, salary and expected number of transactions\n  \n- Wait a few minutes until the KYC check clears.\n  \n- Request an IBAN number (European Bank account number) and send funds to/from your on chain bank account.\n  \n\nThey only accept users from EEA (European Economic Area) member states plus UK and Switzerland. Monerium itself is from Iceland and the IBAN number you get is from a bank in Spain. The received funds from the fiat world will be converted to EURe an ERC-20 token and deposited to your gnosis safe.\n\nBeing able to send funds from a bank account directly to a gnosis safe is kind of magical. It is a self custodial bank account. You can exchange the EURe to any other tokens on Cowswap, send it to the mainnet (have not tried that) or do whatever you like with it.\n\nI sent some EURe token from my gnosis safe wallet to my normal bank account and they arrived on the same day. Pretty impressive. The other way around took a full day, mostly because my normal bank is a bit slow and does not process any new transactions when you send them after the daily cutoff time which is at 10 AM or so. There was not any fee involved. I got exactly what I sent. I even did not have to pay to send the EURe. I signed a transaction in my gnosis safe and they initiated the transaction to burn the EURe in my gnosis safe.\n\nThe whole experience is quite good. The monerium functionality and interface is very minimal. You can look at your account and balance, send transactions and check the transaction history. You can also export the transaction history to a text file. That's it. Sometimes the UI bugged out a bit and I had to reload or re-login to get it working again. Not nice, but also not so scary as the actual tokens are secured by a gnosis safe and not the monerium website.\n\nAs always they are a tradfi institution so they can sever your link to the tradfi world if they want/need to, but they cannot take away your money in your gnosis safe. I looked briefly at the EURe smart contract on mainnet and they have functionalities to 'validate' transactions due to regulatory reasons. To me that sounds like they might be able to blacklist certain addresses. They can definitely recover EURe sent to 'wrong' addresses. Overall it sounds similar to what USDC has which can blacklist certain addresses and mint new USDC. So, in extreme cases they might be able to block your EURe on chain. Not surprising to be honest. I have only looked at the smart contracts for a few minutes though, so take this finding with a grain of salt. Another thing to consider is the liquidity of EURe. FDV is only 1.3 million USD and trading volume is around 150000 USD per day. So the on chain price is not super stable but fluctuates +- 5% around the off chain Euro price.\n\nThe newest Epicenter podcast is an interview with one of the Monerium founders: https://epicenter.tv/episodes/503\n\nAll in all I love it. It is one of the few really mindblowing moments for me in crypto. I like the idea of having a tradfi connected gnosis safe even though I do not really have a need for one at the moment. Maybe I could use it as a more convenient off ramp, especially if the EURe price is below the off-chain price. If they introduce a debit card on top of it I would definitely use it.\n\n\nEDIT: Played around some more. They also support Ethereum mainnet and Polygon POS.
