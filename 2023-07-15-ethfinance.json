The judge asks the SEC's lawyers to comment on Gensler saying under oath that there's absence of regulation in crypto. Then later beginning on page 36, the judge quizes them on allowing the S-1 filing when six of the assets they now claim constitute illegal securities trading were already traded on Coinbase. Some highlights:\n\n- The SEC claims that Gensler does not speak for the SEC, even in his official role as commissioner testifying before congress. Quote: \"*Your Honor was asking about Mr. Gensler and his statements to Congress, and I believe they were three weeks after he became commissioner. I just wanted to note for the Court that any individual commission or statement, as I am sure your Honor has heard before, does not represent a decision. It does not speak for the five-member commission.*\"\n\n- As to the S1 filing they basically imply it's useless buraucracy that has no function in protecting the public: \"*Your Honor, I'll say that simply because the SEC allows a company to go public does not mean that the SEC is blessing the underlying business or the underlying business structure or saying that the underlying business structure is not in violation of the law.*\u201c The judge does not seem to buy this, at all. \n\n- Apart from Bitcoin, they can't comment on assets being securites or not. They can\u2019t answer clearly what the difference between different crypto assets is and how the issuers would determine whether they're securities or not. However they claim the issuers can figure it out on their own with the Howey test. They don't elaborate - basically Gensler's old spiel again. \n\n- They do not want the court to consider the major questions doctrine and allow Coinbase's affirmative defense, arguing for example that it \u201cwill be used to purportedly justify intrusive discovery into the SEC's internal communications and emails (sic!)\u201d. \n\n- The judge seems reasonable and, while not too familiar with crypto, curious to learn more. She's not buying any of the SEC's bs.
