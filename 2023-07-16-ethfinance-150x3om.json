He made sure I set up an account at a CEX and installed a wallet on my phone and gave me a small amount to move back and forth so I knew what I was doing. He'd tell me sometimes about a major news article or if he made a good trade but I didn't really know the details.\n\nAnd then he died.\n\nNow, he'd left me at least some means to gain access to his wallets and accounts. Most were empty. One, a CEX, locked me out completely when I converted his holdings from a token I was unfamiliar with. Mostly, though, it was easier dealing with the CEX than the other bits and pieces lying around. He didn't (to my knowledge) have a hardware wallet.\n\nThis is the bit that people talk about: ensure your partner knows where to find your seed phrases and login details in case of an emergency. I'm going to argue that this isn't enough. I didn't know anything about what I was doing. I took some big risks, like leaving everything on Metamask at one point, and made some stupid mistakes. The biggest problem was that there was no one that I could talk to about this. My friends, his friends, they all had no idea. It didn't take long to work out that asking a question on the Internet was effectively painting a target on my back. I couldn't trust *anyone*. \n\nWhen you are dealing with overwhelming grief and the fact that your entire life has just changed, then dealing with the fear and insecurity of crypto is huge. A lot of the advice, good advice, can be questionable in these circumstances. \"Don't invest more than you can afford to lose\" isn't helpful when you weren't the one who invested. Where do you hide your seed phrase if your living situation is tenuous? A piece of steel doesn't help and just makes it more likely that someone will discover your wallet. Repeating \"staking is easy but you must solo stake\" is really not helpful to someone without a home, or even someone with a home who has never even heard of a NUC, let alone know the difference between chains, blocks and attestations.  \n\nA side effect of losing a loved one is paranoia. I still have moments where I'm just convinced my entire life is going to blow up out of control, because that's exactly what did happen. And with the crypto, that was not paranoia but a very real and true risk. \n\nI gained the impression that he was consolidating his funds into BTC and ETH. There were a lot of coins that I knew nothing about, so I investigated each one and then sold or converted as I worked out how. At some point, I found r/ ethereum and then EthFinance. You don't  know me, but I just want to say that the conversations here have always felt thoughtful and well-thought-through. I will never really feel at ease in crypto space, but at least I wasn't in a room full of people looking to trick the newbie.\n\nI'd like to make a plea to get your partners or loved ones a little bit more involved, if you can. Even if it's just talking about scams and how people lose control of their funds, which can be interesting but also help the person be aware of what the world is like. But I know it is not that easy and might just make someone paranoid. \n\nThere are no good answers. But I did want to say thank you for being there.
