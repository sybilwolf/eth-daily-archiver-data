That is, non-productive assets whose value is strictly derived by people hoarding it. Then for the value to go up always requires the next cohort of buyers to be greater than the previous one. This is basically true for Bitcoin given its economic fundamentals.\n\nThis is not true for Ethereum. And it's due to the burn and PoS. The burn gives an ultimate use to Ethereum, to be spent to feed the EVM in order to settle computation. This creates ultimate buyers, for ever, on an ongoing basis. The users of the network. This means that, even the day that there is not a single extra use case/person/IoT/AI to onboard, ETH will still have to be acquired on an ongoing basis to keep using the network. Therefore, in that scenario where there is no one left to onboard, the burn and issuance will reach equilibrium, the ETH that is consumed will be replaced by the ETH that is produced. At that point the only exogenous demand for ETH is to keep using the network. It's easy to see that this induces a price equilibrium for ETH, therefore deviating for prolonged periods of time from it is difficult, as it results in a very scarce asset.\n\nThe other side of it is that ETH is not only a consumable but can be made a productive asset. The fact that staked ETH has a yield also places a floor on a secular bear market. Because extremely depressed prices result in higher yield. And yield (more specifically risk adjusted yield) is like the communicating vessels principle for finance, all assets tend to have the same risk adjusted yield. This creates another source of demand (besides the one described above) that is reactive to price. Very low prices, result in inflated yield, which attract buyers to obtain that yield which lowers the yield until it reaches equilibrium. Again, this creates a stable price equilibrium around the risk adjusted yield.\n\nA final twist on all of this, which is the only saving grace for Bitcoin. A price is always a fraction, and the base currency (e.g. USD) is in the numerator. All of the above is true when the numerator is constant, which is true in short timeframes (months/quarters...) but not true in multiyear spans. As we know, the central bank policy aims to always increase the numerator, because there is a policy target to result in 2% yearly price inflation. Which, without economic growth, will be met by expanding the monetary base by an equivalent amount and with economic growth then by an even bigger amount. So this gives an ultimate source of new buyers too, due to an ever increasing supply of base currency. This makes all assets whose supply increases at a lower rate than the base currency to be hoarded, making greater fools economics viable.\n\nIf we go into a secular bear it will be because:\n\na) Price went up too fast and too far ahead of fundamentals (onchain economic activity) and needs to come back to meet it.\n\nb) Ethereum, the network, doesn't reach market fit, usage dwindles and price follows.\n\nWe are not in scenario a), at all.

Since the other party has been much more active, this would require rare bipartisanship.  But I do think this is an issue that can appeal to both parties in different ways if only they would try.  If anyone else cares to do the same thing, here is the text of my letter for you to freely borrow from:\n\n*Dear XXX:*\r  \n*\\[removed doxxing intro\\] ...digital assets and the broader domain of blockchain technology, which is what I am writing to you about today.  Recently, this field has been active on the legislative and regulatory fronts, with new legislative proposals in the House (Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft) and Senate (S. 4356 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act) and several high-profile lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It seems likely that one or more bills will emerge for you to consider this year.*  \r  \n\n\n***I am writing to encourage you and the Congressional Progressive Caucus to engage actively in these discussions to assure that resulting legislation can maximally promote the progressive agenda and earn your support.***  \n\n\r  \n*In fact, there is significant alignment between the principles underlying cryptocurrency and the progressive agenda.  The essence of the crypto ecosystem is that data and open-source computer code distributed and synchronized around the world can replace reliance on institutional middlemen (e.g., banks, centralized internet platforms) with a decentralized transparent system available to all in which users can directly take custody of their own assets and personal data.  These features can directly support the progressive agenda and its commitment to sweeping, transformative change:*\r  \n*\u2022\tReplacing banks with self-custody and a fully transparent accounting on a public blockchain will reimagine the role of institutions that exacerbate injustice and inequality.* \r  \n*\u2022\tIncome inequality can be reduced by helping underserved populations\u2014who under legacy systems often cannot get a loan, buy a house, or start a business\u2014to build wealth and carry out financial transactions without needed to rely on gatekeeping banks that may have institutional biases that disadvantage them.*  \r  \n*\u2022\tFacilitating crypto use can help advance racial justice and equity.  A 2019 FDIC survey found that 14% of African American households and 12% of Hispanic American households were unbanked compared to only 2.5% of white households.  A recent Harris Poll found that 30% of Black Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans owned crypto compared to 17% of white Americans.*\r  \n\n\n*Much of the focus of recent attention by Senator Warren and other Democratic leaders has been framed by the dramatic excesses of unregulated scammers such as FTX.  Unfortunately, the tendency has been to throw the baby (digital assets) out with the scammer bathwater by forming an \u201canti-crypto army\u201d.

Since the other party has been much more active, this would require rare bipartisanship.  But I do think this is an issue that can appeal to both parties in different ways if only they would try.  If anyone else cares to do the same thing, here is the text of my letter for you to freely borrow from:</p>\n\n<p><em>Dear XXX:</em></p>\n\n<p><em>[removed doxxing intro] ...digital assets and the broader domain of blockchain technology, which is what I am writing to you about today.  Recently, this field has been active on the legislative and regulatory fronts, with new legislative proposals in the House (Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft) and Senate (S. 4356 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act) and several high-profile lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It seems likely that one or more bills will emerge for you to consider this year.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>I am writing to encourage you and the Congressional Progressive Caucus to engage actively in these discussions to assure that resulting legislation can maximally promote the progressive agenda and earn your support.</em></strong>  </p>\n\n<p><em>In fact, there is significant alignment between the principles underlying cryptocurrency and the progressive agenda.  The essence of the crypto ecosystem is that data and open-source computer code distributed and synchronized around the world can replace reliance on institutional middlemen (e.g., banks, centralized internet platforms) with a decentralized transparent system available to all in which users can directly take custody of their own assets and personal data.  These features can directly support the progressive agenda and its commitment to sweeping, transformative change:</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u2022    Replacing banks with self-custody and a fully transparent accounting on a public blockchain will reimagine the role of institutions that exacerbate injustice and inequality.</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>\u2022    Income inequality can be reduced by helping underserved populations\u2014who under legacy systems often cannot get a loan, buy a house, or start a business\u2014to build wealth and carry out financial transactions without needed to rely on gatekeeping banks that may have institutional biases that disadvantage them.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>\u2022    Facilitating crypto use can help advance racial justice and equity.  A 2019 FDIC survey found that 14% of African American households and 12% of Hispanic American households were unbanked compared to only 2.5% of white households.  A recent Harris Poll found that 30% of Black Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans owned crypto compared to 17% of white Americans.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Much of the focus of recent attention by Senator Warren and other Democratic leaders has been framed by the dramatic excesses of unregulated scammers such as FTX.
