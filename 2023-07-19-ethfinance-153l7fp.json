on my [Moloch's Toolbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14uphdc/daily_general_discussion_july_9_2023/jr8s6ig/) saga.\n\n**Bystander Effect** occurs when there is a group of people who individually all fail to act despite sharing a common goal. Formally, there is a shared objective function amongst actors but there is no *individual* incentive for action. Everyone just assumes or hopes someone else will address the problem. This famously occurs in situations like medical emergencies where no one calls the ambulance despite an incident being widely witnessed. Presumably, everyone prefers that no one dies, but no one is paid out for personally for calling the ambulance and contributing to saving lives so we just watch with morbid curiosity. There are several examples of this that occur Ethereum's staking layer that Ethereum has either weak or no answer to.\n\nThe first example has to do with balancing the adoption of various EL/CL clients ([client diversity](https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution)). Everyone wants to use the easiest to use, best supported, client but if everyone uses it the network is at risk. There is a global incentive for staker's to protect the network (and therefore the value of their stake) but everyone just hopes everyone else will switch so they don't have to. Ethereum actually does have a weak answer to client diversity so long as no client gets a supermajority of validator nodes but there was a time not so long ago where Prysm was edging on this supermajority and we were all at risk. In this specific instance, there was a surge of Layer 0 coordination to push staker's to diversify and Prysm today sits at closer to 40% adoption (but Geth still remains dangerously high).\n\nThe second example has to do with LSTs and staking providers ([staking centralization](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13wcu4w/daily_general_discussion_may_31_2023/jmbhv0z/)). If any given staking provider has 33% of the validators they can potentially do things like ransom attack the network or at least halt finalization at their whim. As above, everyone is better off with a more decentralized network but everyone hopes everyone else will switch so they don't have to. Unlike with client diversity, Ethereum natively offers no incentive of any kind to protect from staking centralization and Layer 0 efforts so far have fallen short.\n\nThis is a tokenomic failure of Ethereum but not one without potential solutions. It is obviously in the interest of competing LSTs to pound the Layer 0 alarm but they should also be willing to spend their marketing budget to target existing Lido validators for conversion. In this vein there are four things that can be done (from most to least ethical).\n\n1) Create convenient zaps to migrate from one LST or staking solution to another. The less friction to migrate, the better. In fact, collaborate to put conversion all under one website with information about each competitor in an easy to digest format.\n\n2) Add bribe incentives for existing Lido validators to migrate and stay with their new staking provider for some time. It makes sense for alternative staking providers to spend their inflation/marketing budget to attract this capital to their platform. The result could look something like the Curve bribe markets or what Tokemak v2 is making that resembles something closer to an exchange.\n\n3) Pool assets to acquire governance share in Lido and vote for self-throttling Lido's market share. You could alternatively just bribe existing LDO holders to vote one way on this particular issue.\n\n4) Become Lido node operators themselves and attack the network from within. Get ETH directed to yourself then ransomware to slash the stake and destroy Lido's reputation unless the DAO votes to self-throttle.\n\nI'm happy to say my local EVMaverick community is doing the first two of these under project codename Lidont. The third option would require a delegating voting locker like XToken was once making. The fourth option would be catastrophic and definitely illegal so if you want to pull that off be sure to do so in a country without an extradition agreement.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Continuing on my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14uphdc/daily_general_discussion_july_9_2023/jr8s6ig/\">Moloch&#39;s Toolbox</a> saga.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bystander Effect</strong> occurs when there is a group of people who individually all fail to act despite sharing a common goal.

But as always, writing will (hopefully) help me connect the dots better and verbalize my gut feeling in a way that makes more or less sense. \n\nLet me start with an unpopular opinion: \"*We are the new maxis*\" \n\nObviously I am not fully serious. Also I don't want to offend anyone in this sub, that's the last thing that is on my mind. I am not talking about we/us as in this community, but rather the ETH community. Additionally I know it's a generalization and that is often bad, but please bare with me for a minute/ wall of text. \n\nLast cycle Solana/ SOL popped up and started questioning the need for decentralization with nodes that basically can only run in large data centers, which excludes solo stakers and hence broad decentralization. A lot of people, including myself from time to time, criticized Solana for it. The trade offs Solana was willing to make seemed wrong and probably still does to a lot of us. \n\nThe next cycle will be even more extreme. The next gen \"parallelization\" block chains will probably take Solanas trade offs even further. I am not an expert in other ecosystems, but e.g. some [participants of the Cosmos ecosystem seem to question PoS](https://twitter.com/sunnya97/status/1673680660358103044) and their solution is not more decentralized, but less with Proof of Authority + governance. \"Social slashing\" (\"if you do things we don't want you to do, e.g. extract MEV by front running, we will slash you\") seems to be state of the art as well. Though we see some L2s that are aiming to decentralize, there are also people questioning if L2s should even be decentralized. Of course, L2s aren't L1s and the security inherited from ETH changes the case, but it was still surprising to me to hear this. \n\nThere are no new chains attacking ETH by being *more* decentralized, they are all coming from the same angle.  \n\nSummary: I think it's a fair hypothesis that next cycle will be to a certain extend the de-decentralization cycle. If that's the case, then ETH will be in a similar position like BTC was last cycle. \n\nNow here's a thing. The ETH community luckily isn't the Bitcoin community. People, both members of the community and \"leaders\", and culture are completely different. I really liked Vitalik's blog post about [Convex vs Concave](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html) world views and how Ethereum's approach is more concave, more pragmatic, more balanced. \n\nStill I feel like at least parts of the community feel strongly about the value of decentralization and see trade offs that don't value it as much as a threat. And I totally get that. In my mind (basically) none of this works without decentralization though I feel like I can start to warm up to *less* decentralization on L2s, because of L1s / ETH's focus on decentralization. Also I understand that experimenting with less decentralized blockchains probably makes sense, but for use cases, that aren't too finance/value-driven. Always remember, from a Bitcoin maxi point of view, Ethereum already is centralized... and that \"experiment\" should have been killed with fire. \n\nBut I also think that reacting like Bitcoin maxis for the past couple of years wouldn't be the right way. First of all I see no competition for truly secure block space. There is no blockchain that could take that place apart from the BTC network and they will probably never give up their core, hence no smart contracts and no \"new alt L1\". I see all these new blockchains as a validation for ETH, not a threat. They know they can't compete, they know they have to make things differently and pick even more extreme trade offs to somehow carve out a niche for them. In my eyes, that's beautiful... I might now agree with them, but why attack them? I understand the argument that they are basically risking their user's deposits by sacrificing decentralization and why people would want to call that out. I also think this won't change a thing, because again... they can't do what ETH does, cause ETH does it already and pretty perfectly. \n\nLet's focus on ETH, the values, the development, the community. Let new L1s fight with Solana (oh my, that's gonna be so much fun when the SOL community calls new L1 out for \"crazy trade offs with regards to XYZ\" etc.). And if you can, try to talk to people that show maxi behavior so that our community makes sure we are really different.  \n\nAgain, because it is so important to me:  I don't want to offend anyone and I also have no concrete people in mind writing this. It's just a gut feeling, but if we all agree that we can be better, we *will be better.*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have been thinking a lot in the past couple of days and I can&#39;t structure everything perfectly just yet.

There is also a reward for reporting validators that should be slashed, equal to 1/512 * effective balance for each slashed validator.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/block-proposal/\">https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/block-proposal/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-19 22:40:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jsoz7v0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_153l7fp","parent_id":"t1_jsoalx5","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/barthib","body":"The reward for proposals increase with respect to the square root of the number of validators.\n\nHowever, overall, we earn less and less because the proposals get rarer and rarer.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The reward for proposals increase with respect to the square root of the number of validators.</p>\n\n<p>However, overall, we earn less and less because the proposals get rarer and rarer.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-20 02:39:07","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-07-20 02:43:40","id":"jsphz17","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_153l7fp","parent_id":"t1_jsoalx5","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Thank you!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-20 02:44:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jspid0c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_153l7fp","parent_id":"t1_jsphz17","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Itur_ad_Astra","body":"So far the past few months, BTC has had its run, Alts have had their run, XRP has had whatever that was, and ETH has just been stalling.

Obviously it isn't good, but, for many people, it may not *that* bad (assuming you aren't concerned with the plight of others too much - some people, like the poorest in certain areas are clearly fucked). So let's assume we avoid global anarchy. Crypto networks are not going away, and will probably grow substantially in time. PoS is \"portable\", so contributing to such networks brings decentralization and stability. If crypto exposure brings you sufficient wealth to adapt, then 1) consider moving to an area that is less likely to be affected (e.g. don't live where: there is crazy heatwave risk; there is drought risk; there is hurricane / tornado risk; there is risk of coastal inundation / sea level rise; there is risk of local shortages due to social pressure, such as densely populated cities). Invest in domestic solar power and water storage. Maintain decent food stores. including nutrients (vitamins etc).\n\nOne thing about high temperatures, that we all expect to see going forward (e.g. 40C+), is that they're *usually* associated with a lot of sunshine. Well guess what, solar power is pretty good at running A/C. So if you have decent solar capacity, you stand a good chance of maintaining local cooling even if the grid goes down.\n\nConsider this case study on heatwaves (likely to affect everyone in the coming years): Most \"developed\" countries, especially at higher latitudes, can handle temporary or even fairly prolonged disasters or heatwaves, *provided power and water infrastructure are operational*. So lets consider somewhere like the U.K. suffers 40+C. After the first week, the power grid starts to fail because 1) it is not designed to tolerate such high temperatures for a prolonged period, and 2) people start running portable A/C units which causes overloads. This has the knock-on effect of causing disruption and panic (like panic buying water etc). If you have local solar powering A/C, and sufficient food / water supplies, you'll probably ride out the crazy shit (2-3 weeks?) until temperatures cool off.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Government collapse is basically anarchy.

Maintain decent food stores. including nutrients (vitamins etc).</p>\n\n<p>One thing about high temperatures, that we all expect to see going forward (e.g. 40C+), is that they&#39;re <em>usually</em> associated with a lot of sunshine. Well guess what, solar power is pretty good at running A/C. So if you have decent solar capacity, you stand a good chance of maintaining local cooling even if the grid goes down.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this case study on heatwaves (likely to affect everyone in the coming years): Most &quot;developed&quot; countries, especially at higher latitudes, can handle temporary or even fairly prolonged disasters or heatwaves, <em>provided power and water infrastructure are operational</em>. So lets consider somewhere like the U.K. suffers 40+C. After the first week, the power grid starts to fail because 1) it is not designed to tolerate such high temperatures for a prolonged period, and 2) people start running portable A/C units which causes overloads. This has the knock-on effect of causing disruption and panic (like panic buying water etc). If you have local solar powering A/C, and sufficient food / water supplies, you&#39;ll probably ride out the crazy shit (2-3 weeks?) until temperatures cool off.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-19 14:37:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jsnamkc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_153l7fp","parent_id":"t1_jsmsy8m","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/llamachef","body":"The climate effects we're experiencing more are from the emissions of decades ago, and humanity hasn't really slowed or decreased those since so the buildup will continue.
