I watched it on livestream yesterday as I am generally interested in the gnosis ecosystem and their chain. Shiftly mentioned being surprised by the vision of gnosis chain as they have thought it being more like an incentiviced testnet. \n\nI am financially and technically invested by being a solo validator on gnosis chain. So take any positive sentiment I have with a grain of salt. The history of gnosis chain is quite an interesting one. It was born as xdai chain as one of the earlier EVM compatible alt L1 chains. The interesting thing they did was not having their own coin, but using xDAI, bridged DAI, as the base token to pay for gas. No own token meant no speculative frenzy in the last bull run. They developed rather quietly the only bigger deal they made was with POAP in 2020, that is why all our POAPs life on there now. And thanks to xDAI chain POAPs can often be minted for free as the gas costs are pretty negligible and are being paid by POAP. I still remember the pre xDAI chain POAPs which sometimes would have cost me $50 to mint.\n\nIn Summer 2021 Gnosis got interested in xDAI chain and took them over. xDAI chain rebranded to Gnosis chain. They started changing the consensus layer from a more permissioned set to a permissionless Ethereum approach. For this they started using the GNO token as a mandatory staking token. One validator costs 1 GNO, which is about $120. Much cheaper than Ethereum. There are about 130000 validators on Gnosis chain, about 6 times less than on Ethereum, but the economic security is obviously much lower due to only 1 GNO being staked per validator compared to 32 ETH for a single Ethereum validator. There are some large staking as a service providers, but nevertheless there are a substantial number of solo stakers, making the gnosis chain pretty decentralized. Unfortunately, I do not have any statistics available, as the websites I used before are defunct since a few months ago.\n\nNow to the vision. The following description is how I understand it and is from public sources I read over the last 2 years. Generally, I think it is very hard for any alternative L1 to have a value proposition as Rollups most probably will eat their lunch sooner or later. At the same time the Gnosis founders have been in the crypto space for so long, I assume they know what they are doing and how hard it is to have a value proposition. At first, their idea was for Gnosis chain to be like an incentivized testnet, like Kusama is to Polkadot. The idea was to first test hard forks on Gnosis chain and then deploy to mainnet. Reality threw a wrench in that idea, the merge on Gnosis chain was a few months after the Ethereum merge, same with the shapella hard fork which will be in 2 weeks on Gnosis chain. \n\nThis brings me to the talk linked by u/shiftly yesterday, which describes the new vision I have not seen described before. I definitely have seen more critical talks by Gnosis chain people aginst rollups in the last few months but did not really know why. The Gnosis team pivoted Gnosis chain to being more of Cosmos like ecosystem around Ethereum. They build a trustless bridge to and from Ethereum. And also gnosis pay will make jumping from the various chains as simple and trustless as possible.\n\nWill it work out? I have no idea. Rollups for me have been the big disappointment of 2021 and 2022 and still are far away from the final version of being as trustless and decentralized. On the other hand Optimism and Arbitrum have become pretty reliable for everyday use and various ZK rollups are coming out left and right. Nevertheless, for me Gnosis chain is a hedge against the Rollup vision not working out as fast as necessary. Gnosis chain might be able to get some more usage in the coming years. Will Gnosis chain end up as a rollup on Ethereum? Maybe. But even then, due to the decentralized validator base, they might have a headstart for sequencer decentralization compared to othe rollups which first have to achieve that.\n\nTldr: Gnosis chain, formerly known as xDAI chain, pivoted in the last few months to a more Cosmos like vision for the Ethereum space consisting of EVM chains connected to each other by trustless bridges.

All in all I think the gnosis team managed to bootstrap a decentralized staker ecosystem, which in itself is quite an achievement. After the upcoming shapella hardfork on gnosis we will see if these programs were succesfull to keep solo stakers for the long term or if most are just staking because they got free GNO and will leave as soon as withdrawals are enabled\n\n1 GNO per validator definitely lowers the barrier.

My gnosis node runs on a beefier NUC than my Ethereum node","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As far as I know their plan was to get to 100000 validators by summer 2022. Which they achieved. They were and still are distributing GNO for staking to dappnode buyers. They had an incentive program were they sent out 10 GNO to stakers. They had a geographical decentralisation incentivisation program. I do not have any up to date statistics on the stakers distribution to judge if all these programs have been successfull. All in all I think the gnosis team managed to bootstrap a decentralized staker ecosystem, which in itself is quite an achievement. After the upcoming shapella hardfork on gnosis we will see if these programs were succesfull to keep solo stakers for the long term or if most are just staking because they got free GNO and will leave as soon as withdrawals are enabled</p>\n\n<p>1 GNO per validator definitely lowers the barrier. But in the end, earning the returns on 1 GNO validator is just not worth it. You will have to run many validators. At the same time Gnosis chain gets quite resource intensive if you have run many validators. Not on the ssd, but on the Network and CPU.

Say I get a 5 ETH MEV block and I am currently opted in. What is preventing me from stealing the full MEV because it is so big and forfeit say 3 months of pending rewards of 0.2 ETH? I can&#39;t see anything. You can switch fee recipient instantly and there is no way of punishing me like I believe there is in RP&#39;s smoothing pool since I own and control the full 32 ETH. Hoping that people are honest is still maybe better in the median than solo staking but there are many technical guys in crypto so rewards could take a fair hit.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-20 15:42:39","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-07-20 16:16:37","id":"jsskd83","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_154hewp","parent_id":"t1_jssgqdr","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/llamachef","body":"I've asked all these questions in the discord so we'll see.
