Most of the discussion went over my head, but my key takeaways were: one-shot signatures could be another important cryptographic primitive for crypto, and while real quantum devices are still scarce a lot of computational optimizations have trickled down from the work on quantum computing to traditional math.</p>\n\n<p>youtube: (link to be added later)</p>\n\n<p>As indicated yesterday, I was getting fed up by the conference topics and decided to quit in the afternoon. Instead, I headed over across the Seine to <a href=\"https://impactblockchainconference.org/\">https://impactblockchainconference.org/</a>, a parallel conference under the &quot;blockchain for good&quot; umbrella for two panel discussions and an nft exhibition.</p>\n\n<p>Summing it up, EthCC[6] has been a great experience and I want to applaud organizers, team, speakers and volunteers for what they have put together! If I would be asked for critical feedback, my only advise would be to not grow any bigger, as the vast amount of content from conference and side events combined was overwhelming.</p>\n\n<p>For your reference, here are playlists for all the recordings grouped by room:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@livestream2387/streams\">https://www.youtube.com/@livestream2387/streams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@amphistgermain3634/streams\">https://www.youtube.com/@amphistgermain3634/streams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@amphisorbonne7368/streams\">https://www.youtube.com/@amphisorbonne7368/streams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@grandamphitheatre6328/streams\">https://www.youtube.com/@grandamphitheatre6328/streams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@amphipontoise4900/streams\">https://www.youtube.com/@amphipontoise4900/streams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@amphipoissy9374/streams\">https://www.youtube.com/@amphipoissy9374/streams</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>edit: line-breaks fixed (I hope). why do you hate me reddit editor?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-21 06:04:15","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-07-21 06:21:57","id":"jsv0shz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_155dxre","parent_id":"t3_155dxre","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/M4gelock","body":"Seems like the right time to go all in, lowest activity and crazy protocol improvements.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Seems like the right time to go all in, lowest activity and crazy protocol improvements.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-20 23:54:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jsu4akn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_155dxre","parent_id":"t3_155dxre","score":25,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/user260421","body":"Define all in lol","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Define all in lol</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-21 04:14:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jsuome6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_155dxre","parent_id":"t1_jsu4akn","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Jin366","body":"Not enough talk about ERC-4337 and the AAvolution in here.

I'm assuming ARB links are still shadow-banned, but want to get the picture across regardless.\n\nThere has been push over the last month or so to get some type of grants framework started with the DAO. Two of the big proposals were Plurality Labs and Questbook. \n\nPlurarlity Labs is looking to start a grants program over multiple phases. Initially running the program, but with an end goal of phasing themselves out once a way to run grants on-chain is solved. I voted \"For\" this proposal ([Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xa0e14b85197d73e825ac30f72b7d895d644ed06159a32a578f4efe47a2739b2f)) and it has narrowly passed. The DAO has been slow to start and somewhat directionless, so I'm hoping this will help with that. While grants will be handed out with this project, the scope is more about the big picture process that develops over the long term.\n\nQuestbook was originally tied in with Plurality Labs, but split off into it's own request. It has a similar goal - a method to run grant programs - albeit with a more focused approach. They have a system they have implemented with other projects they are looking to bring to the ARB DAO. I have been, I guess, 'sponsoring (?)' Questbook as I have been working with them to post the Snapshot / Tally votes. Snapshop has passed ([Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe07fb357b2b40e042ca58a36a1534afc33a1d313d4781ac433536bc884fc3c65)) and the Tally Vote ([Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/52789605232046584393223454610845077119190920888046802640362214067679574612119)) has just started up. I've voted \"For\" on this, as once again I think the grant projects are good for the space and like to see different ideas take a stab at growing the Aribtrum space. Having talked to the people there it seems like a good project!\n\nAn additional note. If Questbook passes, keep an eye out if you want to get involved. There will be a two week window where knowledgably crypto-ians can apply to be a Domain Allocator. Essentially, you would take over 1 of 4 target grant domains (Gaming / Developer Tooling on NOVA / New Protocol Ideas / Education, Community Growth and Events) to help decide if projects can get grant money. It is a paid role, so something to think about if your into that. There are details in the votes.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Little Arbitrum DAO update for everyone as a delegate. I&#39;m assuming ARB links are still shadow-banned, but want to get the picture across regardless.</p>\n\n<p>There has been push over the last month or so to get some type of grants framework started with the DAO. Two of the big proposals were Plurality Labs and Questbook. </p>\n\n<p>Plurarlity Labs is looking to start a grants program over multiple phases. Initially running the program, but with an end goal of phasing themselves out once a way to run grants on-chain is solved. I voted &quot;For&quot; this proposal (<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xa0e14b85197d73e825ac30f72b7d895d644ed06159a32a578f4efe47a2739b2f\">Snapshot</a>) and it has narrowly passed. The DAO has been slow to start and somewhat directionless, so I&#39;m hoping this will help with that. While grants will be handed out with this project, the scope is more about the big picture process that develops over the long term.</p>\n\n<p>Questbook was originally tied in with Plurality Labs, but split off into it&#39;s own request. It has a similar goal - a method to run grant programs - albeit with a more focused approach. They have a system they have implemented with other projects they are looking to bring to the ARB DAO. I have been, I guess, &#39;sponsoring (?)&#39; Questbook as I have been working with them to post the Snapshot / Tally votes. Snapshop has passed (<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe07fb357b2b40e042ca58a36a1534afc33a1d313d4781ac433536bc884fc3c65\">Snapshot</a>) and the Tally Vote (<a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/52789605232046584393223454610845077119190920888046802640362214067679574612119\">Tally</a>) has just started up. I&#39;ve voted &quot;For&quot; on this, as once again I think the grant projects are good for the space and like to see different ideas take a stab at growing the Aribtrum space. Having talked to the people there it seems like a good project!</p>\n\n<p>An additional note. If Questbook passes, keep an eye out if you want to get involved. There will be a two week window where knowledgably crypto-ians can apply to be a Domain Allocator.
