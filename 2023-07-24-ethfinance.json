Since I enjoy podcasts I thought it might be a service to the community to highlight those I really liked (or maybe disliked? Let's see what the future brings). The first edition was okay I think, so here's the second Top3.   \n[Bell Curve: Is Liquid Staking a Winner-takes-all market? feat Hasu](https://blockworks.co/podcast/bellcurve/6051e334-1f09-11ee-aa93-ef3967b342c6)\n\nThis episode is interesting. It's part of the \"LST Season\" of Bell Curve and the first episode after the kickoff. As most of you are probably aware Hasu is a advisor to Lido and was not really in favor of self limiting when the discussion popped up last year (or beginning of this year? I can't remember). \n\nWhat's interesting here is that Hasu explains his arguments and assumptions about the staking/ LST market (e.g. CEXes and how they could capture a massive share withouth necessarily being ETH aligned, because it's just *one* business for them). I followed the discussion back in the days, but didn't really understand where he was coming from and understand him better now. I think we have to distinguish between his comments with regards to the market (\"staking/ liquid staking is a winner takes all market) and specific LST providers/ protocols. He made a very interesting comment (apparently for the first time) where he basically says \"its crucial ETH stays decentralized and the criticism towards Lido is correct\". \n\nLSTs will be huge, listening to this one is a good time investment, even if you don't agree with Hasu in the end. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Uncommon Core (2.0): The Reboot feat Jon Charbonneau](https://uncommoncore.co/podcast/)\n\nDon't worry, this one is not so much about Hasu :) It's the first episode of Uncommon Core after 1.5 years, this time featuring Jon Charbonneau instead of Zhu Su (who apparently couldn't make it). \n\nJon is also front and center in this episode. He is introduced and interviewed, his CV is interesting (though his statement that he's in crypto \"since just one year\" is kind of funny, since he had been interested before, but now he's full time. But if full time is a req, most of us aren't into crypto...). \n\nJon is an interesting guy, since he is not really part of any crypto tribe, but seems to be rather ETH focussed. Since he is rather new and neutral, his point of view is interesting. I made some comments the past couple of days about L2 (de)centralization and most of those were inspired by this episode. I think he is not idealistic and I also don't see him as a \"decentralization maxi\", hence some of his positions will probably clash with some of us, but I also think it's good to discuss counter arguments. Mostly because of this I highly recommend this episode (and probably also to follow Jon on Twitter). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Epicenter Podcast:  Ethereum - MEV, Staking Derivatives and Privacy feat Vitalik](https://epicenter.tv/episodes/505)\n\nThis guest doesn't need an introduction. I picked this episode, cause it's from EthCC, so last week, and probably VB's latest thoughts. \n\nIt's a good interview, nothing too crazy (though there was one comment that I didn't understand, but can't recall what the topic was and hence also can't ask you to explain to me, FML), but still a very good interview. \n\nI also picked it, cause I made a comment in the daily some time ago asking [if there shouldn't be a protocol that allows you to borrow against your validator](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13ogyzj/comment/jl4q6h4/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I even stated that \"It's probably way trickier than I make it seem?\"... and yes, that's the case. And the issue is not tech, it's an attack vector with regards to security. Since you could basically borrow against your validator, setup more validators (repeat) and/ or basically attack the network \"for free\" (you'll be slashed, but you have like 80% of the ETH value back in USD or so). Vitalik mentions this in a slightly different context, but this was a crazy moment (and I have to say I should have thought about this back when I made the comment 2 months ago). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo... this is it, these were in my opinion the best podcast episodes of the past weeks. The XRP case/ decision was also a very important topic and picked up in a lot of podcasts, but I don't think it was as good as these 3. \n\nI think I'll be back mid August with 3 new episodes, since then I'll be back from vacation and will listen to more podcasts on the way to work.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>+++ Benido&#39;s favorite podcasts episodes +++</strong><br/>\nSome weeks ago, someone here asked for podcast recommendations and interesting episodes.

Now, I was playing around with my KYC&#39;ed wallet and thought of connecting it with Gitcoin passport, and to my surprise, I got less than 2 points for that. So my point is, what the heck is this? If the goal is to filter bots from actual users, then shouldn&#39;t a fully KYC wallet be enough to cross the passing threshold?<br/>\nI can think of two approaches. The first one is your address holding, like POAP, NFT, transactions on different chains, SAFE, ENS, public good donation, and Gitcoin is already doing it. This approach I like the most as it&#39;s privacy-preserving. The second approach is, if they are including a KYC option, it should be enough to pass the threshold, whatever that is.<br/>\nCreating a safe wallet will give you more points, and I am not sure their logic makes sense to me anymore. Why not promote both and let the user decide what&#39;s best for them? We have PoH; I wouldn&#39;t do it ever, but at the same time, if I am including this option as a way to provide humanity then it should alone be enough to pass the threshold .&quot;</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-24 06:05:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jt8tgdm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1580pwg","parent_id":"t3_1580pwg","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/DegenKoloToure","body":"Where is it KYC\u2019d?
