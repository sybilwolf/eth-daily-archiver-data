Here's a fun calculation to do for any fellow stakers out there. Try this one at home!\n\nHere's how to calculate your rig's PoW-equivalent wattage. Start with Ethereum's PoW energy usage, which was 78TWh/yr, or 8,904,000,000 Watts. There are currently 22,150,750 ETH staked on the beacon chain. Take the number of ETH you're staking, divide it by the total 22,150,750, and multiply it by 8,904,000,000 Watts to get the PoW-equivalent wattage of your staking rig. **This represents the wattage your staking rig would consume if it were a mining rig controlling the same percentage of PoW Ethereum as it currently controls of PoS Ethereum.**\n\nYour equivalent wattage can make for some fun comparisons. For instance if you're running just one validator, the calculation is 32/22150750*8904000000, or 12,864 Watts. An average household uses 1,200 Watts, so an equivalent mining rig would use the power of over ten of those! To run this 12,864 Watt mining rig on your property, you would need to hire an electrician to wire up a dedicated circuit for it. It would produce as much heat as 9 portable 1500W electric heaters running 24/7! In comparison one Ethereum PoW \"validator\" used to be 9 electric heaters, but now one PoS validator runs on a 40 Watt Intel NUC. That's the power of ditching PoW for PoS!\n\nHere are some additional comparisons for any of you whales out there (the wattages should be good, but be forewarned I may have pulled the comparisons column out of my ass):\n\nStaked ETH | Equivalent PoW Wattage | Comparison\n---|---|----\n32 | 12,864 W | \ud83c\udfae 20 Gaming PCs (Full Load)\n100 | 40,199 W | \ud83c\udfe0 30 US households\n320 | 128,638 W | \ud83d\uded2 1 US Grocery Store\n1,000 | 401,994 W | \ud83c\udfe2 1 US Shopping Mall\n10,000 | 4,019,440 W | \u2708\ufe0f 1 US Regional Airport\n\nThere must be at least a few OGs here who have reached at least Grocery Store status. Any Shopping Mall or Regional Airporters here? (Rhetorical question, no need to dox yourself.) That's the same amount of electricity as a small US city!\n\nNow, keep in mind that these measurements are based on your rig's effectiveness as a percentage of the total network consensus, not in absolute terms ETH revenue. But since blockchain consensus is relative, that's a far more relevant metric for doing this kind of comparison!\n\n(Shout out to [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) for making these calculations a lot easier.)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ever wanted to measure the equivalent PoW mining wattage of your staking rig?
