Tax here is 30% so I want to avoid paying the equivalent of decades worth of net working income (which is also taxed high) in taxes. Because our taxes are so high on crypto and work income, it makes more sense than in many other countries. We don't have lower long-term CGT taxes or tax-free allowances every year. I plan on keeping about 30% for longer term but the rest will go towards index funds and housing, preserving wealth rather than trying to maximize it through riskier moves.\n\nI started buying Bitcoin P2P on Localbitcoins, a big P2P exchange in the day. It has become clear afterwards, through a court case here, that you are not allowed to deduct the cost base when buying P2P due to there being \"no receipt\".

I know roughly where I stand in terms of profit and cost base, but after 6 years and a thousand on-chain transactions, it is a bit messy.\n\nThe issue is of course that I have a time lag from when I want to DCA out, to when I can actually do so.

Then, I am fine even if price crashes, stays the same or increases (best scenario). If prices crashes, it would even be possible to reset my tax base on the ETH by selling and then move to a nice country without CGT on puts, which there are a few, before realizing it. I would rather avoid the latter but tax is high on it in Germany.

From [here](https://blog.lido.fi/how-lido-works/):\n\n> Withdrawal credentials for that ether will be set either to threshold signature of distributed custody or, if withdrawal to eth1 addresses will get accepted by the community, to an upgradeable smart contract that will handle withdrawals when they are enabled.\n\n* How is the ether managed exactly here? Are node operators able to spin up validators even if the ETH doesn't sit in their wallet directly? Or more generally, if I were to spin up a validator -- the requirement is that I have the keys to sign on behalf of the 32E right? How those keys are managed exactly is a relevant detail?\n\n* How does the threshold signature work here? How can Lido allow node operators to sign without giving them implicit custody (keys) over the 32ETH?

The smart contracts don't have forced exits so in both cases you're relying on the honor system that when you withdraw your ETH that they'll actually follow through with the withdraw. If that doesn't happen then stETH loses peg.
