You can copy the code, you can't copy the assets and revenue backing it. crvUSD has four things supporting the peg.\n\n1) A variable borrow rate, currently this is much lower than DAI and there is a better liquidation system than DAI. It's more decentralized (mostly using LST collateral) and has a lower rate. It's simply better for borrowers than DAI or GHO.\n\n2) The Peg Keeper. This is like Frax's AMO. It expands and contracts the supply to keep the peg. This is more capital efficient than the PSM because it keeps the arbitrage profit internal to the system. crvUSD will eventually build up a sizable percentage of its market cap in backing.\n\n3) Curve system revenue. The plan is for the revenue of the Curve system to backstop the crvUSD price once the market becomes sufficiently liquid. They just have to add a burner to convert 3crv to crvUSD. If the crvUSD price is below peg, this creates a lot of native demand on the token. If it's over peg, these purchases effectively expand the crvUSD market cap and liquidity depth due to the peg keeper acting afterwards.\n\n4) External incentives. This is where the CRV issuance comes in. DAOs like Frax are pairing with crvUSD and using their issuance to build liquidity depth on it. High initial APRs create initial demand on the token to bootstrap adoption. Eventually the Lindy can position crvUSD as the dominant decentralized stablecoin. DAI has fallen from grace and LUSD and RAI aren't scaling. crvUSD has all the ingredients to take over this role, ultimately being backed by assets in the peg keeper and becoming a bond backed by the revenue of the exchange as the lender of last resort.\n\nI don't understand your Euler reference in this context.\n\nIt seems to me like you just see a high inflation number and wrote the project off without understanding the fundamentals of the system. Here's a very basic calculation you can do. You can currently make ~25% APR on cvxCRV and 30% on yCRV. CRV circulating supply is about 900M and inflation in the next 12 months is about 125M. So it's growing at about 14%. You should really get into the mechanics of what fraction of CRV issued goes to various parties but if CRV inflation is a $77M USD cost what is the profit of veCRV holders and does it overcome that cost? Well, the profit is apparently at least is ~25% given two easy to verify data sources. So with 607,660,933.53 veCRV that's 151,915,233.382 CRV profit or $93,964,433. Now, 94 is greater than 77, so I think the inflation concern is overblown. At face value, making very pessimistic assumptions the PE is about 32.\n\nThe more you get into the nuance of these numbers though the more bullish this picture looks. For example the inflation cost there is overblown. Again, there are auto-compounders that lock crv rewards without discretion so that issuance can't put downward pressure on the price. There are also numerous DAOs such as Alchemix that have issuance policies that buy CRV on a schedule. So you can subtract that from the cost as well since it's born by that DAO instead of the market. Then there's crvUSD which adds entirely new revenue streams to this picture. So you have the potential to double their revenue on a system that is already oversold by a bear market.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Issuance is still very high.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I said above, most of the issuance is offset by bribes.
