Good on you for choosing this path. I think now might be a perfect moment to start something like this to be ready when the space fills up again with tourists. \n\nI do not know much about your circumstances here are a few things I learned over the last years. My points are rather focussing on the negative side. Not because they should dissuade you from your path, but to prepare you of some obstacles that could be ahead:\n\n- Make sure that you are fine with looking at your shrinking money supply every month. If you have made your peace with that it will not come biting you in the back a few months down the road. Your funding moving towards zero weighs very heavy on some people. \n- Are you sure you can work from home? No one pushing you to finish a goal/sprint is liberating at first, but some people have issues with actually shipping a final product after the initial enthusiasm is gone. They only work under pressure of deadlines and loose focus after a few days. As long as you know what type of work style you and your colleagues like you are still able to deliver. \n- Getting funding always takes longer than expected. Even simple applications might take several months to get through. Plan in advance and not only when funds are running out.\n- Gitcoin is a great public good to get funding and also make your project more known. But if you are not well known it is hard to get more than a few hundred dollars per round. Every dollar is hard earned by hustling on twitter and social media.\n- Check the various chains which have funding programs for projects to deploy on their chains. I remember polygon and celo having something. I am sure many other up and coming L2s have such programs as well. They need builders.\n- You will be in competition with many other teams, which from your point of you might have a inferior product, but better marketing. This might make you angry. Try not to get too jaded about that. The space has a lot of struggling good faith actors as well as successful scammers. Try not to get too tainted yourselves.\n- If you can have a stable side income which does not take up too much time it might be worth it to have less stress with the main project.\n- You can check out various online hackathons which have a good return on time investment. Especially if you do not need a lot of money to live your life. If you manage to program a modular part of your project during a hackathon you might even earn money while working for the project.\n- To get actual users onto your project is a very hard task. Depending on what your project is, expect a very slow uptick of users. Most users have a memory like a goldfish (me included), if you are not constantly present on twitter or whatever social media is used by your userbase, your userbase will shrink after each uptick. Only a few settlers will remain after each media campaign.\n\nI really hope these points does not dissuade, but rather encourage you on your path. I wish you all the best and hope you will show us your project once it is released.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That is awesome. Good on you for choosing this path.

MakerDAO is voting to set the Dai Savings Rate to a max of 8% depending on the utilization rate. I&#39;m thinking of parking some stables in the DSR pool. Did some research but have a few questions I hope you can help me with:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Where does the yield come from? MakerDAO&#39;s T-bills I guess?</li>\n<li>Rate goes down with rising utilization. What is the pool \u00b4utilized&#39; for?</li>\n<li>Is summer.fi/earn/dsr on mainnet the legit place to enter?</li>\n<li>What is your opinion on the overall risk of this strategy?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-31 01:58:41","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-07-31 06:12:20","id":"ju6hj95","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15e6kzl","parent_id":"t3_15e6kzl","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Middle-Athlete","body":"1.
