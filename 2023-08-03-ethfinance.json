This time I will for the first time add quarterly developments, hope this adds some value. I will as always add some thoughts, but I am also looking forward to your feedback, thoughts, etc. I am sure you'll spot some things I missed and just add context wherever possible and relevant! s\n\n  \n**Validator overview - total: 865976 validators\\***  \n\n\n* 705843 active (July: 642061; +63782s / +9,9%, | May: 554322; +151521 / +27%)\n* 76788 pending (July: 90945; -14157 / -15,6% | May: 15537; +61415 / +300%)\n* 0 exiting (July: 5; 0 / +/-0% | May: 7333; -7333 / -100%)\n* 83232 exited (July: 74180; +9052 / +12% | May: 39341; +43891 / +111%)\n\nSo what has happened in July? The active validator count is up only, basically 2000 new validators were added *net* every day. That means close to 100 validators per hour or more than 1 validator per minute. Again: this is net growth, so exiting validators are already in this indicator. The entry queue is slightly down, as we already know from the great daily updates, but even if no new validator wanted to entry, the queue will take more or less one month to clear, while the exit queue is virtually empty. Still interesting that there are close to 10k validators that exited last month. We don't feel them, we hardly notice them in the daily posts, but they do exist. \n\nIf we look at the quarterly development the numbers are even more positive. Mainnet has added 150k validators. For reference: Validator ID 150000 was added 6 months after beaconchain genesis. Validator 300000 started working 9 months after ID 150k (and those aren't net growths, because withdrawals weren't working). The entry queue exploded in the past 3 months, while the exit queue basically doesn't exist anymore. At the same time more than 43000 validators left in the last 3 months.  \n\nConclusion: This is still a one-way street. Every day, for months, more ETH is locked. Add buzzword \"supply shock\". Add \"this isn't priced in\". Add insider \"flippening\" (#ratiogang). I am not going to settle for less than 10k USD per ETH next cycle. \n\n  \n**Client diversity numbers\\*\\***  \n*Consensus*  \n\n\n* Lighthouse 33% (July: 36%, May: 37%)\n* Prysm 41% (July: 38%, May: 38%)\n* Teku 18% (July: 17%, May: 17%)\n* Nimbus 5% (July: 7%, May: 6%))\n* Lodestar 1% (July: 1%, May: 1%)  \n\n\n*Execution*  \n\n\n* Geth 50% (July: 54%, May: 64%)\n* Nethermind 25% (July: 22%, May: 16%)\n* Erigon 11% (July: 13%, May: 11%)\n* Besu 13% (July: 10%, May: 8%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsensus numbers continue to look rather healthy, both on a monthly and a quarterly basis. Prysm usage could come down a little, this 3% uptick isn't perfect, but Teku looking very good and lighthouse is also directionally fine (though those leaving lighthouse are probably switching to prysm, which isn't the perfect outcome). \n\nMore important is the execution clients and the development we are seeing with regards to Geth. Down again last month and heavily down the last 3 months, now scratching the 50%. Please don't get me wrong, that's still too much, but the directional change is healthy and likely shows the network / community understands that relying too heavily on Geth isn't optimal. \n\n  \n**Pool distribution\\*\\*\\***  \n\n\n* lido 31,7% (July: 31,8%)\n* Coinbase 9,4% (July: 9,6%)\n* Binance 5,0% (July: 5,2%)\n* Kraken 3,2% (July: 3,4%)\n* Rocket Pool 3,1% (July: 3,2%)  \n\\+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc.\n\n*Comment: Since I used a different source in May, there is no quarterly data, this will start next month.*  \n\n\nWhen it comes to CEX staking and LSTs, surprisingly the numbers are down only. *All* of the top 5 are losing market share this month. Now what does this mean? Two obvious factors come to my mind: 1. Solo stakers are gaining market share. 2. More people are staking with staking providers/ pools that don't have a token. Sadly if we look at the data the second hypothesis seems to be (partially) right. Figment and Kiln (#5 and #9 with regards to numbers of validators) see growth month on month. Good news is: \"unidentified\" (and I think solo stakers are part of this bracket) is also going up. So staking is a bit of a mixed bag. \n\n  \nIf you think there's more interesting stuff I could add, there are more/ better sources or anything else that could make this better, please let me know!   \nAll percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.\n\n  \n\\* https://beaconcha.in/validators#all  \n\\*\\* https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution  \n\\*\\*\\* https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking // first month: https://beaconcha.in/pools","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Here&#39;s the fourth edition of the monthly staking update</strong><br/>\n<em>(not to be confused with the daily staking update)</em></p>\n\n<p>Frens, it is that time of the month again (well.... technically it was 2 days ago, but I was still on vacation and today is my first day in the office)!

This one interviews two people from the African continent who are involved in blockchain. Their thesis is that African is a continent is poised to adopt blockchain technology much more actively than the rest of the world.

Some interesting factoids:\n\n* Transactions between two neighboring African nations go through Europe, which collects a hefty price (I forget the numbers at the moment, 10%?)\n* The printing presses for paper money are located in Europe and nations get charges something like 10% of the printed value to use them.\n* Some ex-French colonies have currencies created by the colonial regimes and were pegged to the Franc, for which 15% of value was collected.\n* The average age of an African is 19 years with a population of 1.5 billion. Which means that about a billion people are very young, just getting connected to the internet and have no access to a lot of structures that provide connected for us.\n\nAnyway, the episode is here, I recommend a listen: [http://podcast.banklesshq.com/africas-crypto-revolution-leapfrogging-into-the-future](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/africas-crypto-revolution-leapfrogging-into-the-future)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I imagine a lot of people listen to Bankless, but I&#39;d like to draw attention to a specific episode.

I think the inflation number should be one input in diagnosing the holistic health of an economy, rather than simply the target which is pursued through huge changes in monetary policy. If the real inflation number is -1% (due to advancements in production lowering costs), but economists want to peg it to 2%, then monetary policy overinflates money supply in an effort to get to 2%.
