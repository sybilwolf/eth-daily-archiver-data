Frustrated, I decided to flip the same switch on the smart node for the *consensus* client, allowing the smart node's synced beacon chain to act as my own personal checkpoint sync. I point the failing machine there and reboot. Everything fails to start. I cant access the geth filesystem from the desktop. Whole machine takes too long to boot, is laggy.

This is going to be a learning experience in prod.\n\nOriginally I set up the machine using systemd/services as in Sommer Esat's guide. I decide to go with eth-docker instead for the rebuild. You know, for the learning experience. Plus they say you can have it up in 15 minutes. It took me about an hour. Make the linux boot drive, install. Update & upgrade, secure ssh ports. A few small personal linux creature comforts. Clone eth-docker. Install.\n\nRegenerating the staking data on an offline machine and moving the keystore took the longest....because I am an idiot and couldn't get the import keys command pathing right. I was off by one /. \n\nThere is a moral and happy ending to this story, which I have dragged you all through to get to (besides that the validator is back up and chooching...waiting on that 250 eth lottery block), and it is this: execution client diversity is the current thing we need to be harping on like we did with prysm over the last 2 years. Just like the rocketpool smart node, Eth-docker made it super, mega easy to use a minority execution client. I chose nethermind over geth for the rebuild. In addition to switching to a minority client for the health of ethereum, it also had the added benefit of being about 400 GB lighter than geth/lighthouse. Fully synced everything takes up about 800 GB vs 1.2TB. Perhaps the 4TB sizing was not needed after all...  \n\nHappy crab season, ethfinance.

Like kraken and their nft marketplace. Truth be told I could easily believe this is what's happening.\n\nBut then I think about it a bit more, and I simply refuse to believe that nobody cares about agency and freedom. That the future is having your finances managed and controlled by big mafias. Using you money only until they decide that you no longer have permission to do so. And yeah, hacker news people can whine all day that crypto is not really decentralized and that everything is done through infura and coinbase, but the point is not that you *have to be* fully self reliant. The point is that you have the *ability* to be, if you need to. That you have options when shit hits the fan, or when you simply feel like going a bit incognito. And permissionlessness *does* mean that a new infura can spring up anytime if it needs to replace the old one.\n\nSo yeah, with my non-emotional mind, I still believe that crypto has a future, even if indifference is the only thing I feel from all around irl. Price-wise this might not manifest for a long while, but I don't think the future is hype-cycles of memecoins and monkey jpegs. The future is using the system for boring everyday things, but with everyone having more freedom of interacting with the base layer. And also a lot of fights around anonymity.

I&#39;m tempted to feel that the players making moves now (etfs, paypal, etc.) are simply <em>glacially slow</em>, started moving during the bullrun, missed the news that <em>crypto is dead</em>, and just now got to the point of actually having something to show. Like kraken and their nft marketplace. Truth be told I could easily believe this is what&#39;s happening.</p>\n\n<p>But then I think about it a bit more, and I simply refuse to believe that nobody cares about agency and freedom. That the future is having your finances managed and controlled by big mafias. Using you money only until they decide that you no longer have permission to do so. And yeah, hacker news people can whine all day that crypto is not really decentralized and that everything is done through infura and coinbase, but the point is not that you <em>have to be</em> fully self reliant. The point is that you have the <em>ability</em> to be, if you need to. That you have options when shit hits the fan, or when you simply feel like going a bit incognito. And permissionlessness <em>does</em> mean that a new infura can spring up anytime if it needs to replace the old one.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, with my non-emotional mind, I still believe that crypto has a future, even if indifference is the only thing I feel from all around irl. Price-wise this might not manifest for a long while, but I don&#39;t think the future is hype-cycles of memecoins and monkey jpegs. The future is using the system for boring everyday things, but with everyone having more freedom of interacting with the base layer. And also a lot of fights around anonymity. We should take the killing of tornado-cash more seriously, though I&#39;m not sure what could be done.</p>\n\n<p>Well, this became quite rambling. Sorry, rant over.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-08 00:57:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jv9u2at","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15l83h6","parent_id":"t3_15l83h6","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/MrVodnik","body":"Why do you think everything is dead?
