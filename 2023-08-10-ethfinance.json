Discussion of Ethereum-adjacent topics (like alt-L1) is helpful and desirable here. In fact, there&#39;s a good amount of upvoted content here about alt-L1s.

Aside from that, when another alt-L1 does something stupid or suffers an outage, I find ethfinanciers usually like to hear about it.</p>\n\n<p>I find that downvotes in this sub usually signal useless or otherwise low-information comments.
