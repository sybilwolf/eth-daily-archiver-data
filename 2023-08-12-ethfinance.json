The interesting part with this chain is that it has built in AA, I am still reading on this but mention of AA always makes me excited so sharing it here.</p>\n\n<p>On L2B, Arbitrum is more mature in terms of security and I was expecting other protocols to build on top of Arbitrum too but Optimism is definitely leading on the adoption side of L2, by a huge margin.</p>\n\n<p>So far, \nZora, Base, PGN, DeBank and Celo. App specific chain from Pika and Lyra.</p>\n\n<p>In one week, Base has a revenue of 1M and most of that is coming from minting NFT and Bridging. In a way it makes sense to me, Optimism seems to focus towards building the ecosystem of chain, targeting niche user groups, creating a fly wheel of revenue and then  focus on decentralization (as per their last post, expected to start in early 2024) and security.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-12 10:29:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jvw8mji","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15ovax3","parent_id":"t3_15ovax3","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stablecoin","body":"Apps are going to launch their own L2s and print on the gas arbitrage.
