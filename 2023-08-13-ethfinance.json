The approach you mentioned, scaling up and then dividing, is a common way of handling fixed-point arithmetic in Solidity. However, it can be inefficient for large exponents.\n\nPRBMath is a Solidity library that provides fixed-point arithmetic functions. To use it for your case, you'd essentially use their exponentiation function.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, I'll first provide a simple example using PRBMath and then a custom implementation that might be more efficient for smaller exponents:\n\nUsing PRBMath:\nIf you want to use PRBMath, first ensure you've installed or imported the necessary library contracts. Then, you can use their exponentiation function:\n\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"path_to_PRBMath/PRBMathUD60x18.sol\";\n\ncontract Exponentiation {\n    using PRBMathUD60x18 for uint;\n\n    function calculateExponent(uint x) external pure returns (uint result) {\n        uint base = 98e16;  // 0.98 in fixed-point representation\n        result = x;\n        for (uint i = 0; i < 12; i++) {\n            result = PRBMathUD60x18.mul(result, base);\n        }\n    }\n}\n  \n  Note: This is a basic example. Ensure you understand the PRBMath library and its underlying math before deploying anything involving real assets.\nCustom Implementation:\nFor smaller exponents, you can use the \"scaling up and then dividing\" method. It's relatively simple and efficient:\nsolidity\nCopy code\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Exponentiation {\n\n    function calculateExponent(uint x) external pure returns (uint result) {\n        uint baseNumerator = 98;\n        uint baseDenominator = 100;\n        result = x;\n\n        for (uint i = 0; i < 12; i++) {\n            result = (result * baseNumerator) / baseDenominator;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n  This approach has the loop, as you mentioned. But since your exponent (12) isn't very large, it should be efficient enough for most applications.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Did you try ChatGPT? It gives me this:</p>\n\n<p>Exponentiation for fixed-point numbers can indeed be tricky in Solidity, especially given the language&#39;s lack of floating point support. The approach you mentioned, scaling up and then dividing, is a common way of handling fixed-point arithmetic in Solidity. However, it can be inefficient for large exponents.</p>\n\n<p>PRBMath is a Solidity library that provides fixed-point arithmetic functions. To use it for your case, you&#39;d essentially use their exponentiation function.</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of completeness, I&#39;ll first provide a simple example using PRBMath and then a custom implementation that might be more efficient for smaller exponents:</p>\n\n<p>Using PRBMath:\nIf you want to use PRBMath, first ensure you&#39;ve installed or imported the necessary library contracts. Then, you can use their exponentiation function:</p>\n\n<p>pragma solidity <sup>0.8.0;</sup></p>\n\n<p>import &quot;path_to_PRBMath/PRBMathUD60x18.sol&quot;;</p>\n\n<p>contract Exponentiation {\n    using PRBMathUD60x18 for uint;</p>\n\n<pre><code>function calculateExponent(uint x) external pure returns (uint result) {\n    uint base = 98e16;  // 0.98 in fixed-point representation\n    result = x;\n    for (uint i = 0; i &lt; 12; i++) {\n        result = PRBMathUD60x18.mul(result, base);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p>Note: This is a basic example. Ensure you understand the PRBMath library and its underlying math before deploying anything involving real assets.\nCustom Implementation:\nFor smaller exponents, you can use the &quot;scaling up and then dividing&quot; method. It&#39;s relatively simple and efficient:\nsolidity\nCopy code\npragma solidity <sup>0.8.0;</sup></p>\n\n<p>contract Exponentiation {</p>\n\n<pre><code>function calculateExponent(uint x) external pure returns (uint result) {\n    uint baseNumerator = 98;\n    uint baseDenominator = 100;\n    result = x;\n\n    for (uint i = 0; i &lt; 12; i++) {\n        result = (result * baseNumerator) / baseDenominator;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p>This approach has the loop, as you mentioned. But since your exponent (12) isn&#39;t very large, it should be efficient enough for most applications.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-13 05:30:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jvzto3w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15ppv3o","parent_id":"t1_jvzrqwj","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"12 was an example, in practice I want to loop as far as I can before the precision loss is too steep.
