Single Factor - when you choose to login via web3auth(gmail/discord/etc), once authenticated and redirected back, web3auth will derive specific key to your wallet. In simple words, your method of authentication is your wallet, if you lost access to gmail, your wallet is lost as well.\n2. Multi Factor - Logris has written about Shamir's Secret Sharing and they are using the same method.In 2/3 setup, there are three share (it can of 1/n setup too)\n\nShare A - Divided across web3Auth network. This network is distributed across different parties, in total 9 and they need consensus of 5/9. In order to corrupt this, you need to attack more than 5 node which is rather difficult.\n\nShareB - stored on user's device\n\nShareC - password/security question/backup/hardware deviceProcess remains the same, you need 2/3 to authenticate.\n\nTheir selling point is storing key into multiple part distributed across different system.Private key is never stored on one system and never derived again, when we sign in, they are validating the auth and creating a signature which you would use to sign a transaction. So even if one share is compromised, your wallet is safe.You have option of add /remove security measure /shares.\n\nCurrent node operators include (Share A is distributed among them)\n\nBinance\n\nEthereum Name Service\n\nEtherscan\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nZilliqa\n\nTendermint\n\nOntology\n\nSKALE\n\nWeb3Auth (Torus)\n\nAs an example of Safe, its a smart contract wallet but this logic could be used with any Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC, secp256k1 elliptic curve or similar) compatible wallet.\n\nOther example is Braavos wallet, they use your mobile device as hardware signer. If you import wallet on a desktop browser and has a hardware sign-in enabled, you will need to approve the transaction in your mobile. \n\nPersonally, I love this feature. Think of delay in transfer to a new wallet, need approval from guardian, limit max amount of transaction in a day or max amount going out from your address. All this we would be able to do once AA is enabled.\n\nAnother example is Candide wallet, its an smart contract wallet where you can add other wallet as recovery/approver wallet. Same as multi-sig.\n\nIf you have seen few app on Starknet will allow you to interact with a dApp just by providing an email address, they follow the same logic, instead of exposing the address they are using email address as auth, behind the scene you still have a wallet.

This is how decentralized stablecoins like LUSD work.\n\nThe problem is liquidity.\n\nIn essence, RWAs can be decentralized using the same model Liquity's LUSD relies on. With a good combination of over-collateralization, algorithmic mechanisms, and economic incentives to maintain its peg to $1 without being directly backed by USD. The ecosystem's design is such that whenever LUSD deviates from its peg, there are financial incentives for users to take actions that push it back to $1.\n\nThis only works for high-demand, high-churn assets like USD. It may also be able to do the same for high-demand stocks such as APPL or MSFT or GME, provided sufficient over-collateralization in ETH. For instance, to mint on-chain APPL stock at $180 you would need to lock in about $200 worth of ETH.\n\nFor other assets such as real-estate, where not a lot of people are buying and selling the same property every day, this is where you are locked into government acceptance that ownership of an NFT representing that property sufficiently proves ownership of the property itself.\n\nFor assets like stocks, where there's a clear and high demand, a decentralized system like the one Liquity employs for LUSD could easily work. This would only rely heavily on the crypto community's trust in the underlying collateral (ETH) and the robustness of the platform's mechanisms. Which is a reputation ETH is quickly building.\n\nWhen it comes to real-world assets like real estate, the challenges become more pronounced. Tokenizing a piece of real estate would essentially mean turning property rights into digital tokens. This would require not just technological innovations but also significant regulatory changes and broad societal acceptance.\n\nFurthermore, the \"real-world\" component of real estate assets makes them difficult to handle in a decentralized manner. For example, if someone defaults on a loan backed by tokenized real estate, a decentralized network can't (yet) send a bailiff to repossess a house. Such real-world implications need centralized entities or intermediaries to handle.\n\nWhile the dream of a fully decentralized, tokenized world is appealing, we're likely to see a blend of centralized and decentralized systems working in tandem. The more we can align technological capabilities with regulatory frameworks and societal needs, the closer we'll get to this vision.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If you have enough liquidity, every RWA can be tokenized. This is how decentralized stablecoins like LUSD work.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is liquidity.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, RWAs can be decentralized using the same model Liquity&#39;s LUSD relies on. With a good combination of over-collateralization, algorithmic mechanisms, and economic incentives to maintain its peg to $1 without being directly backed by USD. The ecosystem&#39;s design is such that whenever LUSD deviates from its peg, there are financial incentives for users to take actions that push it back to $1.</p>\n\n<p>This only works for high-demand, high-churn assets like USD. It may also be able to do the same for high-demand stocks such as APPL or MSFT or GME, provided sufficient over-collateralization in ETH. For instance, to mint on-chain APPL stock at $180 you would need to lock in about $200 worth of ETH.</p>\n\n<p>For other assets such as real-estate, where not a lot of people are buying and selling the same property every day, this is where you are locked into government acceptance that ownership of an NFT representing that property sufficiently proves ownership of the property itself.</p>\n\n<p>For assets like stocks, where there&#39;s a clear and high demand, a decentralized system like the one Liquity employs for LUSD could easily work. This would only rely heavily on the crypto community&#39;s trust in the underlying collateral (ETH) and the robustness of the platform&#39;s mechanisms. Which is a reputation ETH is quickly building.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to real-world assets like real estate, the challenges become more pronounced. Tokenizing a piece of real estate would essentially mean turning property rights into digital tokens. This would require not just technological innovations but also significant regulatory changes and broad societal acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the &quot;real-world&quot; component of real estate assets makes them difficult to handle in a decentralized manner. For example, if someone defaults on a loan backed by tokenized real estate, a decentralized network can&#39;t (yet) send a bailiff to repossess a house. Such real-world implications need centralized entities or intermediaries to handle.</p>\n\n<p>While the dream of a fully decentralized, tokenized world is appealing, we&#39;re likely to see a blend of centralized and decentralized systems working in tandem. The more we can align technological capabilities with regulatory frameworks and societal needs, the closer we&#39;ll get to this vision.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-14 10:22:57","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-08-14 10:26:35","id":"jw5z4ko","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15qkvqf","parent_id":"t1_jw5w2z7","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"How about rare/ old cars or Pok\u00e9mon cards or old paintings.
