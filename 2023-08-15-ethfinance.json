Seriously, if there&#39;s another Turing-complete decentralized blockchain out there achieving this, I&#39;d love to know about it. Every other Turing-complete chain out there seems to either not care at all about decentralization, or have 50% or more of supply set aside for devs and VCs to dump on retail.</p>\n\n<p>In this podcast, Justin Drake and Tim Beiko brilliantly navigate us through Ethereum&#39;s uncharted roadmap. Sure, if you visit the ethfinance subreddit as much as I do, EIP-4844 and MEV burn are already on your radar, but that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. The Ethereum roadmap goes much further, with each milestone like 4844 and PBS leading to even deeper and more exciting frontiers.</p>\n\n<p>Statelessness, the vital role of VCs in subsidizing Ethereum L1 R&amp;D, enshrined rollups, the transition to needing fewer honest actors for trustless operation \u2013 they cover it all. And let&#39;s not forget about quantum computing&#39;s connection to Ethereum&#39;s roadmap and the intriguing world of trustless mempools.</p>\n\n<p>I encourage everyone to check out the video. From Ethereum Roadmap Completion to Cryptography &amp; Sustainability, this interview delves into a wide array of fascinating topics. It&#39;s like a journey through Ethereum&#39;s Sci-Fi roadmap, and I&#39;m here for it!</p>\n\n<p>Hats off to Justin Drake, Tim Beiko, and the Ethereum Discord community for keeping us on the cutting edge of Ethereum&#39;s evolution.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-15 06:02:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jwa2tel","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15rirbm","parent_id":"t3_15rirbm","score":46,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nightfallsh4","body":"Thanks so the summary, I'm looking forward now to listen to the episode.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks so the summary, I&#39;m looking forward now to listen to the episode.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-15 07:14:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jwad8bl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15rirbm","parent_id":"t1_jwa2tel","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-15 08:23:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jwao8wp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15rirbm","parent_id":"t1_jwa2tel","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/OkDragonfruit1929","body":"Not just a smartphone, it simplifies the computation requirements so much that even a smartwatch could do it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Not just a smartphone, it simplifies the computation requirements so much that even a smartwatch could do it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-15 08:51:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jwastu2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15rirbm","parent_id":"t1_jwao8wp","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/TheHighFlyer","body":"Thanks, I needed this outzooming.

It's pretty much Dan Robinson sharing his personal view about the state of DeFi which of course is heavily Paradigm/ VC driven with a focus on e.g. Uniswap v4. Still I think his thoughts are interesting, exactly because of his background. VCs see the world/ ecosystem differently and while I don't think me or you will agree with everything he says, I think it's good understanding their point of view, where the industry is headed and what the hot topics are.  \n\nI picked this episode because I already discussed the \"SOL Money\" episode [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15nz9zj/comment/jvp9qg3/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Without this post, the SOL episode def would have been my pick, so that one is interesting as well. \n\nHonorary mention go to the [episode feat Hasu](https://www.bankless.com/early-access-hasu-explains-is-lido-a-threat-to-ethereum). I didn't pick it, cause it is basically a copy of the LST season content on Bell Curve I mentioned in the second edition. I still believe Hasu makes good points. \n\n  \n[zero knowledge podcast: Gnosis catch-up with Stefan George](https://zeroknowledge.fm/287-2/)\n\nI am following Gnosis more and more, mainly because of Monerium and Gnosis Pay. This podcast is a pretty good summary of the innovations Gnosis is pushing these days, but also includes a summary of the history, how it started and how they operate including the importance of decentralization. On top they discuss innovations like account abstraction, intents and more. So if you are interested in learning more about Gnosis, this episode is pretty good. (Disclaimer: I do run 4 GNO validators)\n\nLet me also mention the episode about [\"Intents\" with Chris from Anoma](https://zeroknowledge.fm/285-2/). I still believe that intents will be one of the hot topics for next cycle. I didn't pick the episode because it's talking a lot about IBC and is more Cosmos driven and hence probably less interesting for this sub. \n\n[Bell Curve LST Season](https://blockworks.co/podcast/bellcurve)\n\nThis one is not so much about a special episode, but a general rant about the LST reason. Summary: I was pretty disappointed. I stopped after one hour listening to the episode with Sreeram / EigenLayer. Maybe because I have a good picture by now what EigenLayer is and how it works, but in my opinion it was really boring. \n\nAlso the other episodes about the staking router, the business model etc. weren't really good. After the MEV season that I enjoyed a lot, I was expecting better content and more innovative episodes. Too much stuff about Lido, too much \"winner takes all\".
