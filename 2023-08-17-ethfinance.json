Is Superphiz, or anyone else here being paid to shill the Friend.tech referral/early access codes? We need to be critical of ourselves and the people here who we look up to. This subreddit is built around not allowing anyone to monetise it. However, the issue is not the question. It's the provocative way in which it and the parent comment was phrased:\n\n>*benido2030* \"was superphiz twitter hacked or is he really into this social ponzi?\"\n\n>*cryptomoon2020* \"The bigger question is whether he is receiving a fee from them to look into it.\"\n\nBenido's comment can be interpreted as a genuine question, but it just as easily could be interpreted as a question asked in bad faith. Knowing Benido, I'd give the benefit of the doubt here, but really I think it could have been phrased better because it left the bad faith interpretation out there to be built on, which it was.\n\nCryptomoon's comment then builds off the bad faith argument but rather than asking what if some people might be getting paid, he decided to opt for the disingenuous, edgy or even hostile phrasing depending on your interpretation. This is why I feel Superphiz was right to call Cryptomoon out on this. He was was just blatantly throwing shade at Superphiz rather inciting an actual discussion.\n\nFurther down in the thread, Cryptomoon indicates that he wasn't joking and calls out more of Superphiz's activity.\n\n>\"The money he [Superphiz] receives from rocketpool and his hostility to eigenlayer when they were not even live suggested different to me.\" [Cryptomoon is suggesting that these things are evidence that Superphiz is being paid behind closed doors]\n\nSo this isn't just a case of being edgy. It's just a straight up lack of respect and a toxic culture which we don't want to be commonplace here. Sure, we all get hot headed from time to time, but any regular comments of this tone will result in a ban for anyone. Also, I don't understand why you think that Superphiz telling Cryptomoon to fuck-off is any kind of escalation compared to what Cryptomoon initially said. Cryptomoon made a very clear attack at Superphiz and Superphiz, rather than having to explain why he is innocent just didn't want to waste the energy. It was simply tit for tat in the form of Superphiz saying I'm not going to entertain your stupid trolling effort which he has every right to do until evidence surfaces of someone like him actually being paid for.\n\nRegarding the doots, what I generally don't want to promote is excess drama. You may remember that excessive drama is why I started dooting after the initially divisive EVM airdrop. Personally, I think that Superphiz's comment which got dooted wasn't necessary. I am glad he stood up for himself in the initial thread, but continuing it in a new one only perpetuated the drama and it wouldn't normally be something I'd add to the doots. However, given it was a quiet day and it got so much attention, I felt the need to include it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Let&#39;s get something clear here, Cryptomoon asked a valid question. Is Superphiz, or anyone else here being paid to shill the Friend.tech referral/early access codes? We need to be critical of ourselves and the people here who we look up to. This subreddit is built around not allowing anyone to monetise it. However, the issue is not the question. It&#39;s the provocative way in which it and the parent comment was phrased:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>benido2030</em> &quot;was superphiz twitter hacked or is he really into this social ponzi?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><em>cryptomoon2020</em> &quot;The bigger question is whether he is receiving a fee from them to look into it.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Benido&#39;s comment can be interpreted as a genuine question, but it just as easily could be interpreted as a question asked in bad faith. Knowing Benido, I&#39;d give the benefit of the doubt here, but really I think it could have been phrased better because it left the bad faith interpretation out there to be built on, which it was.</p>\n\n<p>Cryptomoon&#39;s comment then builds off the bad faith argument but rather than asking what if some people might be getting paid, he decided to opt for the disingenuous, edgy or even hostile phrasing depending on your interpretation. This is why I feel Superphiz was right to call Cryptomoon out on this. He was was just blatantly throwing shade at Superphiz rather inciting an actual discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Further down in the thread, Cryptomoon indicates that he wasn&#39;t joking and calls out more of Superphiz&#39;s activity.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The money he [Superphiz] receives from rocketpool and his hostility to eigenlayer when they were not even live suggested different to me.&quot; [Cryptomoon is suggesting that these things are evidence that Superphiz is being paid behind closed doors]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So this isn&#39;t just a case of being edgy. It&#39;s just a straight up lack of respect and a toxic culture which we don&#39;t want to be commonplace here. Sure, we all get hot headed from time to time, but any regular comments of this tone will result in a ban for anyone. Also, I don&#39;t understand why you think that Superphiz telling Cryptomoon to fuck-off is any kind of escalation compared to what Cryptomoon initially said. Cryptomoon made a very clear attack at Superphiz and Superphiz, rather than having to explain why he is innocent just didn&#39;t want to waste the energy.
