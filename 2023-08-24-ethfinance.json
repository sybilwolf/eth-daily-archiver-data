But I believe the cost to the chain of a 33% or 51% attack is lower than people think it is. 33% is kind of a nothingburger aside from finality being delayed for a while. With 51% afaik finality and censorship are the main classes of attacks, both are easily attributable for social-layer slashing, and neither can screw with the already-finalized history of the chain without the entire attacking stake being automatically slashed.</p>\n\n<p>I am not too worried about Lido with 33%, as I don&#39;t believe it really affects the trustlessness of the chain.

And I&#39;m sure many of the SPOs would rather poison pill their entire company at that point rather than use user funds to initiate the attack (and likely shoulder massive unknown criminal and civil legal liability).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t recall the details well, so take this with a grain, but an entity who has more than 33% can prevent the chain from finalizing, which means they can prevent their own slashing (at least for a period of time). Do you think paid operators would willingly allow their stake to be slashed? (No, I don&#39;t think they would)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that finality is more or less a little indicator light on the chain that lights up to confirm that it isn&#39;t going through any turbulence that could cause it to potentially roll back. The absence of finality doesn&#39;t prevent Ethereum from chugging along as usual, in practice. And I believe that includes slashing.</p>\n\n<p>The situation with Lido is not good, but it&#39;s also not dire. The Ethereum protocol has some impressive resilience even if the majority of its stake were controlled by an attacker - it&#39;s much more resilient than PoW. It maintains better guarantees during an attack, and it&#39;s so much easier to unwind/fix after an attack.</p>\n\n<p>I agree that refusing to self-limit is an attack on the chain in a manner of speaking, but it&#39;s not a dire, all-hands-on-deck <em>attack</em> attack that merits socially slashing them imo.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-24 16:56:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jxmk46y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15zrzr8","parent_id":"t1_jxmacsw","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/eth10kIsFUD","body":"I agree with all your points.\n\nMy hope is that a credible threat might help others understand that the risk-adjusted value of stETH is worse than other options.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I agree with all your points.</p>\n\n<p>My hope is that a credible threat might help others understand that the risk-adjusted value of stETH is worse than other options.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-24 16:01:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jxmce8k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15zrzr8","parent_id":"t1_jxmacsw","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"If it is made clear that they will be slashed by hardfork at a strict point mom and pop won't deposit with them.

I haven't developed my ideas fully yet, but I'm zooming in on some thoughts about friend.tech. If you know me, you know that I enter EVERYTHING with wide-eyed excitement, then I begin to form concrete opinions over time. Here's a snapshot into my progress.\n\n**Things I'm excited about**\n\n\\* It's an intriguing social graph that leverages a lot of new and existing technologies in a new way. You can complain about it all you want, but the reality is that it's a \"state of the art\" web3 tool, leveraging progressive web apps, fully abstracted wallet management by privy, and Coinbase's Base L2 for high throughput. Don't ignore these advances. Wallet creation SHOULD be this easy. L2's CAN provide this scaling. Progressive web apps CAN bypass onerous app store requirements.\n\n\\* The idea of lending based on social credibility has ALWAYS appealed to me. I believe it's a way for people who have less to boot strap themselves to a better place (if done responsibly). The problem with this model (as I see it) is that the pool is SO shallow, there are a few elites on ft and millions of commoners. A well-designed social lending system empowers commoners without the need of the elite. I remain optimistic that this can come to fruition. As a side note, one of the reasons I'm so into POAP is for this social credibility graph.\n\n**Reasons I'm becoming increasingly hesitant**\n\n\\* The bonding curve creates a harsh dichotomy between the \"haves\" and the \"have nots\". If you enter ft without any substantial wealth, it's impossible to access the ideas of the best thought leaders, and those thought leaders really do have important things to say. Being alone on ft is a real scenario for many people and it's untenable. I definitely encourage people to create value where they are, but the access bar is high here.\n\n\\* It results in palpable emotional suffering. I don't want to exaggerate this, nor do I want to understate it, but there is a real emotional consequence both when no one buys your keys (shares), when someone sells your keys, AND with the realization that you cannot afford to access everyone's feed because you don't have the wealth to buy their key.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Y&#39;all are going to love this.
