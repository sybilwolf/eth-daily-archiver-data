This narrative enables Lido to aggressively grow through dubious means like the [karpatkey partnership](https://twitter.com/AnotherVizsla/status/1665694309046185987). Karpatkey manages many large DAO treasuries and apparently karpatkey bought steth with these treasuries and blocked adding other LSTs. Only after public outcry some DAOs intervened and now hold a more diverse LST portfolio.\n\nIn my opinion, accepting this narrative makes people complacent and fall in line behind Lido, because the alternative, e.g. binance dominating the staking market, is obviously a worse outcome. Lido propagates this statement because it helps them to justify their means. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy which again helps Lido. It is not surprising that Lido now aggressively spreads this narrative again on various platforms like bell curve podcast, bankless and twitter. Lido is well connected and they can place their narrative quite effectively in the space.\n\nDoes the narrative actually make sense? At the core the narrative is \u00b4The dominant LST has the most integrations and the largest network effect\u00b4 and due to this all ETH will flow to it. In essence it reduces the complexity of staking products to one or two quantities and argues the end state lies at the edge, i.e. one dominating LST. This pushes people into becoming [convex thinkers](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html), which in this case helps Lido to divide up the market 'You either support us or you support big centralized exchanges'. The simplicity of the narrative to me is similar to some very simplified arguments by (hobby) economists which are then surprised that actual market data contradicts them. They then argue that people are not 'rational' actors. But what actually happens is they dumbed down the complexity of a system to a level which makes it easily calculable but the outcome of this simplified system does not match reality anymore because they unknowingly removed some essential mechanics.\n\nEven the market itself does not support the Lido narrative If you look at market data, like the recent [glassnode insights report](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2023/). Lido grew by 54% since January 2023, and rocket pools rETH grew by 157%. How is this even possible because I thought according to their narrative they would win automatically because of network effects. rETH is by pretty much all quantifiable means an inferior product: Lower network effect, lower liquidity, fewer integrations, lower yield. People now even pay a premium to own rETH. Is it because people are stupid? I would argue that the simple convex thinking of the Lido narrative removed a lot of the actual complex decision making of market participants and that is why the Lido narrative should at least be questioned or even rejected outright.\n\nBut why does Lido dominate. They were the first LST. Making staking accessible for everyone. They are less centralized than Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. They did not really have any competition in the market until about 1 year after the Beacon chain launch when Rocket Pool started. And now there are alternatives, some better, some worse and new entrants will come. Sure, due to historical reasons Lido will be the larges LST for years to come, but I am personally not convinced that they will inevitably reach 90% market share because of network effects alone.\n\nAnd now to a more personal note. Does it make a difference for me to buy an LST from an established player compared to a new entrant? Yes definitely. Storing my ETH in a tested smart contract has its value. Having access to degen plays is great. Being able to borrow money against my LSTs is necessary. But does it make a difference if the established player has over 30% dominance or 3%. Not really. rETH has enough liquidity and integrations for me with just about having 4% of the staking market share. The marginal utility of network effects of a larger LST protocol is already pretty close to zero and other parameters, like systemic risks, become more important.\n\nTL;DR: The Lido narrative of 'There will only be one LST' has been spread quite efficiently by Lido. This simple narrative leaves out nuance and makes the community complacent. Even the market itself does not seem to support the narrative. Be careful accepting or spreading it further.\n\nEdit: karpatky -> karpatkey","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I find it the most interesting that the Lido narrative: \u00b4there will only be one LST and because of that it is better it is us (Lido) than any even more centralized player\u00b4 is so readily accepted by many people. This narrative enables Lido to aggressively grow through dubious means like the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnotherVizsla/status/1665694309046185987\">karpatkey partnership</a>. Karpatkey manages many large DAO treasuries and apparently karpatkey bought steth with these treasuries and blocked adding other LSTs. Only after public outcry some DAOs intervened and now hold a more diverse LST portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, accepting this narrative makes people complacent and fall in line behind Lido, because the alternative, e.g. binance dominating the staking market, is obviously a worse outcome. Lido propagates this statement because it helps them to justify their means. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy which again helps Lido. It is not surprising that Lido now aggressively spreads this narrative again on various platforms like bell curve podcast, bankless and twitter. Lido is well connected and they can place their narrative quite effectively in the space.</p>\n\n<p>Does the narrative actually make sense? At the core the narrative is \u00b4The dominant LST has the most integrations and the largest network effect\u00b4 and due to this all ETH will flow to it. In essence it reduces the complexity of staking products to one or two quantities and argues the end state lies at the edge, i.e. one dominating LST. This pushes people into becoming <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html\">convex thinkers</a>, which in this case helps Lido to divide up the market &#39;You either support us or you support big centralized exchanges&#39;. The simplicity of the narrative to me is similar to some very simplified arguments by (hobby) economists which are then surprised that actual market data contradicts them. They then argue that people are not &#39;rational&#39; actors. But what actually happens is they dumbed down the complexity of a system to a level which makes it easily calculable but the outcome of this simplified system does not match reality anymore because they unknowingly removed some essential mechanics.</p>\n\n<p>Even the market itself does not support the Lido narrative If you look at market data, like the recent <a href=\"https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2023/\">glassnode insights report</a>. Lido grew by 54% since January 2023, and rocket pools rETH grew by 157%. How is this even possible because I thought according to their narrative they would win automatically because of network effects. rETH is by pretty much all quantifiable means an inferior product: Lower network effect, lower liquidity, fewer integrations, lower yield. People now even pay a premium to own rETH. Is it because people are stupid?

I am no aave user, but still I am not sure what the TVL of the aave contract has to do with possible liquidations. Prices come from oracles and are not generated within Aave.

My point is that in my personal usage an LST with 4% of the staked ETH has enough integrations for me. Sure, your usage might differ so you make different compromises than I do. I use maker and gravita (Mainnet and Arbitrum) to get stablecoins. Aave is as you said an option. rETH in Aave is supported on Arbitrum as well. I am no aave user, but still I am not sure what the TVL of the aave contract has to do with possible liquidations. Prices come from oracles and are not generated within Aave. If someone borrows/deposits large amounts of rETH the supply APY goes up or down, nothing more, right?
