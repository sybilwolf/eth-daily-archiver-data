But others have not yet made their own verdict, and still need to discuss it more. Rocket Pool has some... interesting aspects in its design. Therefore, open dialog and valid concerns should be embraced by the community.</p>\n\n<p>Rocket Pool is really a cool project. Currently most of my LSTs are rETH, but me, personally, wouldn&#39;t bet on its long term dominance nor would consider RPL as a long term hold. </p>\n\n<p>I currently still don&#39;t stake anything on my own hardware, even thou I have a NUC I bought specifically for this. When I finally do so, I am thinking either clean solo- staking (not to add another layer of risk) or Stakewise. I am still considering RP, but the more I think about it, the more distant this seems to me. In my opinion, its design is too extractive from node operators, which I believe are the ones who put in the most work.
