Lido&#39;s pool operators having 50% really isn&#39;t catastrophic from the perspective of Lido&#39;s governance protocol in context of the Ethereum protocol, so this post would likely serve to ground people in reality.</p>\n\n<p>50% plus Lido actually does start censoring blocks from competing staking pools = Take hard action.
