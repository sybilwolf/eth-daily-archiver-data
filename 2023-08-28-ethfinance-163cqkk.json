You might ask: what are the benefits of using \"native\" vs \"bridged\" coins? As long as by \"bridged\" we assume moved over the official L2 bridge, they're both as legit as it gets.\n\nThe key distinctions are:\n\n1. Native USDC on L2: allows you to redeem USDC directly on Layer 2, helping you save on gas fees.\n2. Bridged USDC: offers a fully permissionless experience.\n\nThe second point is crucial. Circle, the company behind USDC, can block any USDC... but only on L1. Once the coins are bridged to L2, they're locked in the Arbitrum bridge, and all bets are off.

I believe this is the real reason why USDC, and others, feel forced to deploy their contracts directly to all the major L2s.\n\nThe loophole is very simple - just use bridged tokens. It is so simple that I am starting to believe that, in the future, to stay compliant, Circle (and others) will freeze tokens locked in the bridge. They might introduce a temporary converter that will allow the conversion of \"bridged\" to \"native\" L2 tokens. Ultimately, they'll blacklist the bridge's address, blocking any interactions altogether.\n\nI'm convinced that Circle would like to avoid this, but they'll bend under regulatory pressure. This is somewhat akin to blacklisting Tornado Cash. As long as Circle can control the coins, they'll be allowed to operate. Once they lose control, they'll risk legal consequences.\n\nIf this unfolds as described, it could lead to further tightening of the grip on L2s, splitting them into two groups: compliant and illegal.\n\n*Above is based only on my understanding of how the stuff works, if might have got something wrong...*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Don&#39;t read it, I think I&#39;ve got it wrong.

Give validators with larger effective balances a (slightly) larger percetage interest, but only increase their attestation weight by a reduced amount.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you have a validator with 128 ether, maybe it gets rewards equivaent to 4.1x a 32 ether validator rather than just 4x. At the same time, it&#39;s attestations are weighted at maybe \u221a4 x a 32 ether validator rather than 4x. </p>\n\n<p>In this way, if all Lido (and centralized exchanges) care about is getting as much profit as possible they are incentivized to go for big validators with to take advantage of the Rich-get-richer\u2122 mechanism.
