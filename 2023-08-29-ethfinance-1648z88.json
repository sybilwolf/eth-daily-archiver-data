This came as a significant surprise to me when I was first learning about Ethereum's quantum resistance roadmap. Basically we get to keep all our existing private keys, and then sign/prove possession of those same keys using a quantum-resistant algorithm instead of ecdsa. This is because quantum algorithms can attack signatures, but they can't attack private keys directly.~~ [(see reply)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1648z88/daily_general_discussion_august_29_2023/jycd0jq/?context=2)\n\nInterestingly, adding quantum-proof signatures does not require a hard fork strictly speaking. The main difference between hard and soft forks is that hard forks change or broaden the definition of what's valid on chain, whereas soft forks restrict the definition of what's valid. Quantum resistance is perfect for a Bitcoin soft fork, since there is a natural restriction in protocol definition (from \"a transaction is valid if it includes an ecdsa sig\" to \"a transaction is valid if if includes a ecdsa sig AND a quantum-resistant sig/proof\"). You could even could use an anyone-can-spend scheme similar to SegWit to ditch the ecdsa sig altogether.\n\nOf course, Ethereum will have the luxury of using a hard fork to ditch ecdsa in a more clean and orderly way. On Bitcoin, miners will have to agree at some point to stop mining ecdsa transactions and to orphan all blocks that include ecdsa transactions - just like they do with non-conforming SegWit transactions (even though they conform to the original Bitcoin specification).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s a similar situation to the &quot;anyone-can-spend&quot; transactions used by SegWit.
