I am four days late, but I will partly start from scratch anyway: Maybe you have seen [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1661ki5/comment/jyiin33/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from last week - it will play a very important role in today's overview, both because a comparison doesn't make sense anymore and because of the importance of the data. \n\nI will as always add some thoughts and this time there is an obvious call to action included. But I am also looking forward to your analysis, I am sure you'll spot some things I missed and just add context wherever possible and relevant! \n\n  \n**Validator overview - total: 916037 validators\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 772860 active (August: 705843; +67017 / +9,5%, | May: 554322; +218538 / +39,4%)\n* 49562 pending (August: 76788; -27226 / -35,4% | May: 15537; +34025 / +219%)\n* 0 exiting (August: 0; 0 / +/-0% | May: 7333; -7333 / -100%)\n* 93532 exited (August: 83232; +10300 / +12,4% | May: 39341; +54191 / +137%)\n\nAugust is pretty much in line with the development of the past months: The network is secured by more and more validators. In four months we have added over 200000 active validators, which means the number is almost 40% up. We can see the risk off effects the withdrawals had. \n\nAt the same time the entry queue has peaked and is slowly going down. It will still take some time to go to 0, there are still close to 50k validators waiting and more are added everyday. The exit queue is still non existent, but there are validators exiting, in August more or less 10k (comment: probably slightly less, since my numbers are really from today!).   \nConclusion: This is still a one-way street. Every day, for months, more ETH is locked. I don't think we will hit 1M active (!) validators this year, but that's still the goal for 2024. That would result in 32M ETH staked and hence locked at least temporarily. That would be more than 25% off the supply. Let's go!   \n**Client diversity numbers\\*\\***  \n*Consensus*  \n\n\n* Prysm 46% (August: 41%, May: 38%)\n* Lighthouse 33% (August: 33%, May: 37%)\n* Teku 14% (August: 18%, May: 17%)\n* Nimbus 5% (August: 5%, May: 6%)\n* Lodestar 1% (August: 1%, May: 1%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Execution*\n\n* ***Geth 84%*** \n* Nethermind 7% \n* Erigon 2%\n* Besu 5% \n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsensus numbers continue to look rather healthy, but Prysm usage is increasing and we could see a 50% share soon. Teku and Nimbus are sadly losing market share. If you run a validator and run Prysm think about switching to one of the clients. I run Teku myself and have never had any issues. \n\nAs mentioned on the execution front things have changed (though they haven't really changed, it's just the numbers... but still!). Maybe you remember that for the past months Geth's dominance had been going down and we were celebration 50% last month. That is apparently not the reality and Geth has a 84% monopoly. I guess I don't have to tell you all that this is not healthy. So let me quote [https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution](https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Switch from Geth to a minority client!** \n\nI will try to do it since I am running Geth, I will contact the dappnode discord to see how easy it is. And if I can do it, you can do it as well... Obviously every user of LSTs should contact their LST issuer as well and pressure them to switch clients. I want this number down next month! \n\n  \n**Pool distribution\\*\\*\\***\n\n* Lido 32,4% (August: 31,7%)\n* Coinbase 8,6% (August: 9,4%)\n* Binance 4,5% (August: 5,0%)\n* Kraken 3,0% (August: 3,2%)\n* Rocket Pool 3,0% (August: 3,1%)  \n\\+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc.\n\n  \nThe pool distribution is a mixed bag: Lido is gaining market share and will soon reach 33%, which is dangerous. At the same time all other CEX LSTs are losing market share and Rocket Pool is almost stable. \n\nTwo entities that are gaining market share are the staking pool provider Figment and Kiln. Both have 100%+ grown in the past 6 months, Kiln is almost up 1000% (yes, 1 0 0 0 %). \n\nLong story short: If you have stETH, sell it or even better withdraw via the lido-homepage (which is probably not a technical withdrawal from the beaconchain, but still burning stETH while receiving ETH from their reserves) and become a solo staker or use rETH. Also keep an eye open for new staking solutions like Diva Staking.   \nIf you think there's more interesting stuff I could add, there are more/ better sources or anything else that could make this better, please let me know!  \nAll percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.  \n\\* https://beaconcha.in/validators#all  \n\\*\\* https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution  \n\\*\\*\\* https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Here&#39;s the fifth edition of the monthly staking update</strong><br/>\n(not to be confused with the beautiful daily staking update)<br/>\nI am back in the office and have finally some time to document the ETH&#39;s staking environment.

It is a co-ordination layer between a multitude of stakers and node operators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is 31 operators who can be removed at any point by one entity: the Lido DAO.

As you might have guessed I am not bullish on Polkadot or GLMR. Polkadot seems to excite some developers, but in my view pretty much no one else. They are probably developing great stuff, but no one is using it. The reason for this is in my opinion Gavin Wood. He seems to be one of those developers which appear charismatic to some. He is very convinced of himself and how good he is at what he is doing. In the early Ethereum days he more or less wanted to oust all the non dev people from the Ethereum foundation because he thought outside of him and a few other devs no one is actually working. He might not have been totally wrong back then as the early Ethereum organisation was a total clusterfuck.

It has to be said that during the Shanghai attacks parity saved Ethereum from the DOS attacks. Client diversity for the win. Also other projects he pushed were pretty bad, they managed to create a multisig which not only has been exploited once but twice within a few months. Quite a bit of ETH was lost by many people.
