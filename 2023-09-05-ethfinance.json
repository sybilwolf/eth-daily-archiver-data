It's striking just how close the 4-year cycle keeps playing out.\n\nOf course, it'd be a mistake to assume just because we got lucky before, we will get lucky again. Or rather, perhaps the mistake is to assume \"luck\" when past positive outcomes were the result of good actors doing various excellent things both for themselves and the network.\n\nEither way, I think the best play for anyone feeling awful right now is to step back but still check in, just at a slower pace. You don't want to burn out a couple months before this cycle's version of DeFi summer. If we blow up there's nothing you could have done to prevent it anyway.

If you are reasonably certain that a BTC ETF will be approved by the end of the year, and GBTC can be converted to an ETF within 6 months following that (high probability tbh), shorting spot BTC and long GBTC is a relatively &quot;risk free&quot; 20%+ within 12 months. </p>\n\n<p>ETHE has $4.8b AUM, and a <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav\">30% discount to NAV</a>. Again, if you make the bet that an ETH ETF is a matter of time, and ETHE conversion to spot ETF follows, it&#39;s a great bet to short ETH and long ETHE for a trading desk. Both trades can be done in size, and with regulated American institutions (Grayscale and Coinbase). </p>\n\n<p>So given the mammoth AUM, you can have billions in short pressure until the discount to NAV for both trusts are brought close to 0 (or at least 5% before the arb becomes not worth the risk/time).
