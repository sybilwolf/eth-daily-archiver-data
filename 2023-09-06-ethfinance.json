Firstly, if they did, it would be out-of-spec, unofficial software and validators associated with it would be subject to slashing. However easily (or not) it could be detected is another matter, but nonetheless, it would be a risky proposition for a large (and allegedly reputable) financial service. Secondly, I'm struggling to see how network integrity could even be maintained under a scenario where spoofing was so rampant.\n\nHere is a rough procedural breakdown of the required communication but I've no idea how hard it is to implement, and whether it would disrupt efficient network communication.\n\nIf node connections to peers are already *established* (as seems to be normal operation to maintain network integrity), the spec could require that attestations were signed by the originating node and verified by (at least some number of?) initially connected peers. Without this extra verification step, the attestation would be rejected, so the originating node would be compelled to sign and seek verification. Connected peers could use the *established* connections to interrogate the originating node, which would seem to make spoofing pretty difficult (i.e. if it's using multiple signatures, it won't know which one to use to respond). At best, the originating node spoofing interface could only take a guess at which validator the verification was in response to, and if it was spoofing many hundreds of beacon nodes, it would get found out pretty quickly, and slashed. The upshot of this procedure is that staying within the rules, by maintaining a low validator : beacon node ratio, is *vastly* less risk and effort than trying to spoof and risk slashing.\n\nThat's what I got so far :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>But someone could just code an identity (key) management system and overlay that on top of a beacon node to interact with as many validators as they want on a single beacon node.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed - I&#39;ve been thinking more about this. Firstly, if they did, it would be out-of-spec, unofficial software and validators associated with it would be subject to slashing. However easily (or not) it could be detected is another matter, but nonetheless, it would be a risky proposition for a large (and allegedly reputable) financial service. Secondly, I&#39;m struggling to see how network integrity could even be maintained under a scenario where spoofing was so rampant.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a rough procedural breakdown of the required communication but I&#39;ve no idea how hard it is to implement, and whether it would disrupt efficient network communication.</p>\n\n<p>If node connections to peers are already <em>established</em> (as seems to be normal operation to maintain network integrity), the spec could require that attestations were signed by the originating node and verified by (at least some number of?) initially connected peers. Without this extra verification step, the attestation would be rejected, so the originating node would be compelled to sign and seek verification. Connected peers could use the <em>established</em> connections to interrogate the originating node, which would seem to make spoofing pretty difficult (i.e. if it&#39;s using multiple signatures, it won&#39;t know which one to use to respond). At best, the originating node spoofing interface could only take a guess at which validator the verification was in response to, and if it was spoofing many hundreds of beacon nodes, it would get found out pretty quickly, and slashed. The upshot of this procedure is that staying within the rules, by maintaining a low validator : beacon node ratio, is <em>vastly</em> less risk and effort than trying to spoof and risk slashing.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s what I got so far :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-09-06 09:23:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jzecwm6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_16bb42v","parent_id":"t1_jzdz86v","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Well, that might actually work!

This signature is impossible to create if you do not actually own 32 ETH, i.e. it is unspoofable. If you own more than one unique lot of 32 ETH, your node creates multiple unique proofs so that you can join the network as multiple validators. Basically this process is the fancy Beacon Chain equivalent of signing messages from an address that has 32 ETH in it, saying \"Yep this is my address, and I vote that Block Y should be part of the chain.\"\n\nSo in Ethereum's consensus, 32 staked ETH = 1 vote. You can spoof anything else other than that 32 ETH, and it doesn't give you more votes or more control over the network. If you try to spoof having more ETH than you actually do (i.e. more validators than you actually do), everyone else just checks the blockchain and sees that you don't actually have the ETH you say you do, and ignores messages from your node.\n\nStated in a different way, no resource other than ETH is actually relevant to the current consensus algorithm. Every 32-ETH validator gets the exact same network privileges, no matter what kind of software or hardware or internet connection is responsible for the validator sending messages out to the network.\n\nI think this is an interesting discussion as well.
