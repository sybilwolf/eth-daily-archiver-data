The most common governance designs we have today are plutocratic systems with delegation further concentrating power in the hands of a few whales. This is certainly [a problem](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame).\n\nHere is my common refrain for the goal of governance systems:\n\n**The basic goal of governance is to have rational, informed, value-aligned people get together to make rational, informed, value-aligned decisions about the most important issues of the day.**\n\nIf the only represented interest is highly liquid capital then as we\u2019ve seen in the US in the past 50 years you can expect the system to pursue short-term profits at the detriment of all other factors. Shareholders care about their share price and dividends above all other factors and so they appoint a CEO and structure his compensation package to reflect this desire. As a result companies destroy the environment, have little to no regard for their employees well-being, subjugate their local communities, pursue one merger and acquisition after another in order to form too-big-to-fail monopolies, and exploit every financial and political system they can to stifle competition and create power imbalances in their favor. From a game theory perspective this is the expected outcome of this design. I would not call this value-aligned wrt all the required participants in the system. It eventually becomes exploitive of some in favor of others.\n\nThe most obvious way to address this problem is to represent other interests at the root of the power structures in the governance systems over the organization. However, to avoid those interests also being captured by capital their influence must be non-transferrable (even delegation and public voting raises bribery concerns). This raises a few questions:\n\n1) What other interests should be represented and how?\n\n2) How do you distribute influence without the proof-of-personhood systems nation states rely on?\n\n3) What becomes of today's governance tokens? How do they retain their purpose? Should they retain their purpose?\n\nFor the first question, it entirely depends on the organization and what they are hoping to achieve. One straightforward answer to this question is to take a survey of all the necessary actors in the system and their incentives. Any actor whose participation is not inherently mercenary should be represented in governance somehow. For example, an NFT DAO would probably want to represent collection curators, artists/builders, and buyers.\n\nIn many cases there are readily available sources of Sybil resistance for those actors. Many of them have measurable, on-chain, actions and pay costs such as gas as part of doing what they do. For example, you could have a DAO distribute influence to NFT buyers based on the number of NFTs they have bought and held or some other metric that skews for users and not bots. Each set of actors represents an interest in the DAO and can form a governing body (like OPs citizen's house). Taken together these governing bodies form the root power structure of a [multicameral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicameralism) governance system. To the degree that the selection criteria for each governing body is independent of capital, the resulting system should be plutocratic-resistant.\n\nNow that you have representation of various interests that are important to the success of the organization you need a way of resolving disputes between them. Now here there is *a lot* of prior art from centuries past. I don't think just assigning each house a weight and doing a weighted sum produces an optimal result but it would be incredibly simple to implement and still probably better than a straight plutocratic token voting system. In some systems like the US each governing body can vote others for low threshold votes and that veto can be overridden with much higher threshold votes.\n\nSo what becomes of today's governance tokens? Will they still be valuable or will they largely fade into irrelevance like most \"utility coins\" of 2017. I think that even in a utopian design most DAOs should still have representation for capital. Many DAOs are profit oriented. Transferrable governance tokens represent the interests of existing/new capital entering the system. In such systems these parties *should* have a voice and ultimately they should have a contractual claim upon excess revenue in the system (however indirect). So, we will still have these governance tokens, and they will still pay dividends, capture buyback, etc but we have the opportunity to evolve towards more resilient governing bodies as the size and importance of these organization grows.

Since I enjoy podcasts I thought it might be a service to the community to highlight those I really liked (or maybe disliked? Let's see what the future brings). It's not a real summary, so if my thoughts make you curious, you might want to jump in to listen to the full episode. They are always linked in the headline.  \nHere is a list of all the past posts:\n\n[Benidos favorite podcasts no.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/14r0ocb/comment/jqql97w/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[Benidos favorite podcasts no.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1580pwg/comment/jt9qh1v/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[Benidos favorite podcasts no.3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15rirbm/comment/jw9ltqc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow here are the new ones I really liked from the past couple of weeks. Interestingly they are all very technical and let me be honest... I sometimes couldn't really follow the guests/ hosts. I think they are all great, but in these cases I would really recommend taking some dedicated podcast time with 100% focus. \n\n  \n[Bankless: Scaling Ethereum To The Next Level with zkEVM feat. Justin Drake and Brian Retford](https://bankless.com/scaling-ethereum-to-the-next-level-with-zkevm)\n\nMaybe you remember a post from u/liberosist talking about the different types of zkEVMs there are (I tried to find it but couldn't). This podcast basically talks (partially) about this. Since this is fairly technical topic, it's moderated by Justin Drake and RSA is more or less downgraded to listener. \n\nThis includes how L1 might become a zkEVM in the future based on some of the developments in the L2 landscape and the positive side effects this might have (e.g. lower hardware reqs for validators). \n\nI think this episode is pretty good and a great addition to the sci-fi roadmap episode from ethcc since it's very forward looking, but in the end this is why we are here, right? \n\n  \n[Epicenter: Frontier Research - Solving Ethereum's MEV Problem feat. Stephane Gosselin](https://epicenter.tv/episodes/511)\n\nThis episode is a pretty good one if you are into MEV. Stephane Gosselin was one of the flashbots founders and has left the project some months ago. In this episode he talks a little about the MEV landscape, his impact and how he would rate it (interesting answer here!). On top he gives some insights into his new venture \"Frontier Research\".\n\nOne major topic is RFQ = request for quotes and intents, but they also tackle PBS, MEV burn etc. \n\nI think you need a pretty decent understanding of MEV to be able to follow this episode. If you do, this is 60 minutes+ of very good content, especially since Stephane knows flashbots, but is not 100% aligned, but going down a new (and much needed?) experimental road. \n\n  \n[Uncommon Core 2.0 - An Incomplete Guide to PBS feat. Mike Neuder and Chris Hager](https://www.ucc2.xyz/podcast/episode/1bb543a8/an-incomplete-guide-to-pbs-with-mike-neuder-and-chris-hager)\n\nPBS or proposer builder separation has been around since a year or so. This episode features Mike Neuder (from the EF) and Chris Hager (from Flashbots), which is a pretty good panel since it the main parties involved came together. \n\nThe first hour or so is a discussion, the second part is a followup discussion with only Hasu and Jon. My take away: PBS is a design philosophy/ space. What does this mean? When I first learned about it I basically thought PBS was designed, the scope was clear and we only needed implementation. I think the conclusion after this episode is that this is not the case. There are a lot of different implementations possible and it's not even clear if ePBS (enshrined PBS) is the way to go. \n\nu/eth10kisfud since we talked about MEV burn [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16bb42v/comment/jzd9by5/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Well I am glad you asked, because I got you covered! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bonus: The Chopping Block - Coinbase\u2019s Paul Grewal on Why the SEC Is Going After Crypto So Aggressively](https://unchainedcrypto.com/the-chopping-block-coinbases-paul-grewal-on-why-the-sec-is-going-after-crypto-so-aggressively/)\n\nThis Chopping Block episode is a pretty good summary about \"The SEC vs Crypto and Coinbase\". I liked it a lot because I think Paul Grewal is a pretty cool guest (Paul is Coinbase' Chief Legal Officer) and he pretty transparently explains why Coinbase acts in the way it does. \n\nI am not sure the speculation about Gary Gensler's motivation is the best approach, but the rest of it is a very good summary and includes some industry insights that I think are a very interesting and if you didn't follow as closely this episode is the one you wanna listen to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is it for today, but I already have picked one podcast episode for the fifth edition!
