Rather, here's my perspective:\n\n1) he is an actor who has behaved with integrity historically. That is to say, I can't really point an action by him that goes against his expressed values. I'm not saying I agree with his values or his attitude, just that I believe him to be true to himself and I think he sees himself as someone with integrity.\n\n2) neither Bankless or Sassal are actors who have behaved with integrity historically. That is to say, I can point to numerous morally questionable actions of all 3 of these actors over the years, *and* in some of these cases I have witnessed admissions (rarely direct but nonetheless obvious) they were aware of the dubious ethics. I don't believe these people behave with integrity and I don't believe they truly believe that about themselves either. I'm not calling them the worst evil or anything. They are \"middle of the road\", whether one wants to call it pragmatic, good enough, what have you.\n\n3) in another life, I've been in Evan's shoes. It is soulsucking to behave rightfully and watch others reap the fruits. Nobody acts the right way because they're inherent paragons of justice.
