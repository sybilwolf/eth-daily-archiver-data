Where we see more confederated designs are within less antagonistic settings like collaborative engineering orgs as per the numerous examples above. When you're the engineer defining multiple layers, this system works really well and it allows common sense to override in situations where general policies would result in stupid outcomes.

Perhaps this is just a trend of federated governance systems over time; they tend to creep in power and stifle innovation until they collapse under their own weight.

The responses that have come up in response to this post have taken 2 forms:\n\n1) Voter participation sucks and we need to concentrate power to make anything work around here. I'll address that a bit in a different post.\n\n2) Isn't this going to devalue the governance token? What is the point of a governance token that only has a minority power over governance?\n\nI'd like to take a few paragraphs to discuss what I think the rights and responsibilities of permissionlessly tradable governance tokens should be in a multicameral governance structure.\n\nAmong most modern DAO designs there is usually a singular governance token. This token usually serves two purposes. The first, as the name implies, is it acts as a force in governance. The second is it serves as a fundraising tool potentially by multiple mechanisms such as ICO, bond, inflation schedules, or call options. There are a few other minor uses as well that I go into [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/wliv6s/daily_general_discussion_august_11_2022/ijtvcz1/). When people buy this token they do so with the expectation that they have a claim upon the future profit of the system the DAO governs. Ultimately, greed fueled speculation is what gives governance tokens most of their tradable value.\n\nThe abysmal governance participation we see for most DAOs today is a strong indication that the governance power of governance tokens is not the primary source of their demand. Therefore, adopting a multicameral governance structure and diluting this governance power should not overly affect the usefulness of a governance token as a fundraising mechanism.\n\nThat said, care must be taken to protect the contractual rights of the governance token for its primary purpose. If clarity on this is not provided, investor confidence will wane, and the DAO will quickly find itself unable to raise funds by issuing tokens. At that point the DAO either must have a self-sufficient product, rely on charity from necessary participants, or watch as necessary participants stop doing their necessary work and the system fails.\n\nOne guarantee the DAO can provide to the governance token holders is to escrow the treasury funds directly within the governance token governing body (the capital module). System profit should be automatically sent to the treasury. At minimum, since each governing body controls its own state, this gives the token holders the ability to revoke token approval to these funds to the parent DAO. This guarantees those token holders a contractual right to the treasury should the DAO dissolve or they want to revolt. All they have to do is pass a policy to pay out the treasury to themselves.\n\nAnother guarantee the DAO can provide the governance token holders is to make it very difficult for the parent DAO to change any fund flow related policies without their approval. The capital module needs to have confidence that their power over the purse can\u2019t be whimsically revoked. Different types of proposals in the parent DAO can potentially have different rules required to ratify them. This is also consistent with granting governance power over topics to those it affects the most. The governance token holders are those most affected by changes to monetary flows and should have a greater say on changing certain parameters related to that than other governing bodies. This satisfies a design goal of *fairness*.\n\nThe last guarantees all come from the ability of each governing body to maintain its own internal state. The parent DAO can only invoke functions on the governing body contract that it allows. Any control over these matters the capital module grants to the parent DAO are inherently revocable. This gives the capital module ultimate control over the issuance of the governance token and all matters dependent on that such as how to incentivize liquidity depth for the token, how to structure bonds, its inflation schedule, etc.\n\nIn summary, it is my belief that so long as the governance token holders have faith in the future revenue of the system and their claim right to it the token should retain value. So long as it has value it can serve its primary purpose as a fundraising mechanism. I don't believe diluting the governance power of these tokens will destroy their value, but I do think it can lead to a DAO that is more resilient and likely to succeed in the long term for reasons stated in my previous post. The main ingredient we're missing to try this somewhere is a guinea pig and a fairly small software package. I think it's a *much* better direction than what Rune is doing to Maker with \"neural tokenomics\" for example.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I wrote <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16c6vpw/daily_general_discussion_september_7_2023/jzk2o58/\">recently</a> about multicameral governance designs.
