Nevertheless, I still am very positive about the next few months in Ethereum. Here are a few things I am looking forward to:\n\n- Holesky testnet. This is a replacement for the Goerli testnet. It will have 1.4 million genesis validators to start and individuals can spin up their own ones later on. Genesis is tomorrow (Friday) at 14:00 UTC. I set up my 2 nodes and distributed my 2500 genesis validators to them. One is running nethermind/nimbus on an ARM minicomputer with 100 validators, The other one is a much more powerful ASUS PN51 running besu/teku with 2400 validators. I am curious if these 2 machines are able to manage the heavy load of the larger validator set and contribute to a stable holesky testnet. I am only slightly nervous.\n  \n- Diva testnet. Diva is a DVT (distributed validator technology) liquid staking protocol and they are testing their stuff on the Goerli testnet at the moment. I have a node up for a few weeks now, but they needed to improve their software to get rid of some bottlenecks. Waiting until the new release drops for dappnode users and then I can finally play around with it. It is an alpha testnet, so I am not expecting Diva to have a market ready product this year, but I think it is one of the more promising LST projects out there.\n  \n- Gnosis Pay: Waiting for my debit card to be sent out. Hopefully in a month or two I will get it. I just like the idea having a direct channel between my tokens and the real world to buy stuff and send fiat onto the chain. I am really interested how the UX will be and if they managed to create a seamless experience. I am a bit worried about all my purchases being tracked on chain for everyone to see. I personally am curious if the self 'custodial bank account' or the 'privacy nightmare' narrative will win for me here.\n  \n- Dencun upgrade. Massively reducing the cost of transactions on rollups is gonna be quite interesting to see. At first probably the most stupid but fun dapps will dominate. With time, new applications will come out to truly take advantage of the cheaper blob space on Ethereum. The upgrade will not happen in the next few weeks, but there is steady progress. Some last minute additions are still being considered, but to me it looks like people are heads down working on it. Hopefully by the end of this year we will have it.\n  \n- Rollups/L2 will rule the world. We have seen quite a few new rollups in the last few months: Linea, Base, zkSync Era, zkEVM, mantle, zora, public goods network, worldcoin. There are now over 30 L2s lised on L2Beat. But not only new rollups pop up. Existing chains switch to an optimistic rollup: Celo pretty much decided to become an optimistic rollup, fantom started a similar discussion. Also gnosis chain is looking into ways to become an L2 (a validium, not a rollup) to Ethereum. It looks like the next narrative might be having the best rollup/L2 on top of Ethereum and not so much an creating another Ethereum killer. I am really looking forward to what the rollup/L2 landscape will look like in a year.\n  \n- Eigenlayer: In a few months we will probably see if Eigenlayer is more than just a bunch of convincing powerpoint slides and a charismatic speaker. We will see if they have actual product market fit and enough demand for their ideas. There are already some interesting developments with the espresso sequencers and the already started mantle L2. Even though I am not sure how mantle can use EigenDA if Eigenlayer is not much more than a restaking smart contract at the moment. In a few months we will see. I am also curious how Eigenlayer will tackle centralisation issues.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>ethfinance activity seems to be in a bear market as well and the crab gets to some people.

Traditional finance is extremely effective for many people, especially in developed countries. It offers a very wide set of products and services, and comes with crucial features unavailable in DeFi - credit/uncollateralized loans, protection from theft/fraud, welfare systems for the difficult times (like COVID), easy payments to friends/family/all merchants etc. </p>\n\n<p>DeFi will only appeal to a niche - a) those who live in countries with broken traditional finance, b) those who embrace a fully digital lifestyle, and c) as a hedge. This can be a very valuable niche, but it&#39;ll always be a niche, and a shrinking one as developing countries keep improving their economies and financial infrastructure, and as fintech and tradfi continue their relentless march forward. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d say DeFi has definitely lived up to my expectations, just need for the UX to improve.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-09-14 04:17:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k0ja85i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_16i99gu","parent_id":"t1_k0j2pa0","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"The question wasn't asked in Davos, but in a conference that has \"token\" in it's name and references \"leading voices in crypto\" on its homepage.
