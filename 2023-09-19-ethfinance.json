The responses that have come up in response to that post have taken 2 forms:\n\n1) Isn't this going to devalue the governance token? What is the point of a governance token that only has a minority power over governance? I talk about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16fmfto/daily_general_discussion_september_11_2023/k02q0ue/).\n\n2) Voter participation sucks and we need to concentrate power to make anything work around here. Let's dive in to that.\n\nMost DAOs today have a voter participation rate of less than 20%. Even when delegation is supported the delegates themselves aren\u2019t all particularly great at participation and need a cat herder to get much done. The exceptions to this rule are DAOs where there are regular votes and where voters get paid extra by voting.\n\nTwo examples that come to mind for this are Kyber Network and Curve. Kyber Network directly rewards voter participation. You can see the rewards for current and past votes [here](https://kyberswap.com/kyberdao/vote). Curve is a bit more indirect in that only a subset of governance decisions come with monetary compensation and that compensation is indirect through bribes. This one is a more complicated topic I dive into a bit [here](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/evolutions-in-liquidity-sourcing/).\n\nAn interesting footnote about the Curve participation is the ve system and admin fees that are optimized by pairing veCRV with liquidity has led to liquid lockers (yCRV, sdCRV, cvxCRV, etc) to optimize revenue. These liquid lockers have a side effect of concentrating voting power. As a consequence of that Curve has outstanding voter participation amongst its tokens but a relatively low Nakamoto coefficient.\n\nOne clear lesson that stands out from both of the above examples is voters participate better if there are regular votes that they are paid to show up and participate in. Outside of the obvious incentive alignment that comes with compensating voter participation, voter participation increases when:\n\n1) Voting is cost-minimized\n\n2) Their vote is perceived as being more impactful on the outcome\n\n3) They have something to lose\n\nDrawing a parallel to elections to nation states. US voters are more active when:\n\n1) Their state supports voting by mail and other mechanisms to make voting more convenient\n\n2) They live in a swing state or a state without first-past-the-post electoral college rules\n\n3) They are voting on an issue that affects them more personally (e.g. women vote more actively when abortion is a hot topic). Bribery is seasonal along the same lines (e.g. the NRA donates more when gun rights are a hot topic).\n\nFor blockchains, cost minimization is a matter of off-chain message signatures rather than L1 transactions like Maker has. There\u2019s not much we can do for the second point without concentrating power and sacrificing voter participation but contentious votes having higher participation is a natural phenomenon.\n\nThe last thing we can do is create something to lose for each vote. This comes in two flavors. First, we can use bonded KPIs to attach something at stake to each vote. The basic concept of a bonded KPI is simple. You bond your influence against a prediction during a commit round each cycle (e.g. quarterly, yearly, etc). The bonded influence is the only influence eligible to vote. Your vote goes into effect immediately but your prediction is kept secret during the cycle. At the end of the cycle, everyone reveals their prediction by posting a decryption key. Then a decentralized one-shot oracle like UMA provides a value for the metric. The bonded influence is redistributed based on the relative accuracy of everyone\u2019s predictions. Finally everyone claims their influence from the bonded KPI and the next cycle begins. The result is that influence will trend towards those best at making predictions. I suggest the skill of making accurate predictions is correlated with competence at voting well. When combined with a value-aligning selection criteria for initial influence to bond, we end up solving the stated goal of selecting a rational, informed, value-aligned set of voters that vote on the most important issues of the day.\n\nThis system breaks down where someone can have enough influence over the metric to predict that very bad things will happen, ensure they do, and be rewarded for doing so. This is similar to how \u201cassassin\u201d prediction markets work or why we don\u2019t let athletes bet to lose their own match. In that case I\u2019d suggest the DAO might just have to dissolve that governing body and form a new one without that bad actor. It\u2019s a thorny problem for sure.\n\nThe second flavor is an inactivity leak for not voting. For tradable tokens this isn't viable unless you somehow ensure all forms of LP token (e.g. Uniswap NFTs, Aave aTokens, etc) are also eligible to vote. However, this system is more viable when influence is not an ERC-20 token. In that case, getting influence in a governing body is a bonus perk of something external to the governing body. Once you're in, unless you\u2019re doing active work for the governing body your relative influence should decay. In broad terms the active work of a governing body is to continually do the things the issuance selection criteria select for and to vote well. I think it\u2019s therefore fair that if someone is voting poorly (see KPI above) or not using their voting power regularly they should lose that influence. A DAO is ill-served by having a large voter base of inactive/inattentive voters, even if they delegate. Measuring voting activity is much easier than measuring vote quality.\n\nAn implementation of inactivity could resemble something like Ethereum\u2019s where the higher the percentage of the existing voters are inactive the higher the turnover of influence should be. This creates something of a market-based approach to encourage voter participation. The end result is create higher turnover of the governing body to one consisting of active participants and then to pay them for the hard work of voting well. By the numbers we have, this is how you actually build a DAO and not just a fundraising mechanism.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I wrote <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/16c6vpw/daily_general_discussion_september_7_2023/jzk2o58/\">recently</a> about multicameral governance designs.

The dude is very gung ho and often goes against his advisors. Worst of all, he has already made it clear that he thinks favourably of Russia and would cut aid to Ukraine which is vital for their survival as an independent nation. Now, you may think that this is good for peace since the Ukraine war would be over, but Russia has made it clear that their ambitions don&#39;t stop there. Moldova would be next and then its Article 5 territory which is a very dangerous game. Oh, you don&#39;t believe me when I say Russia won&#39;t stop at Ukraine? Well they have alluded to it many times, are already blaming the war they started on NATO, we once thought they&#39;d stop at Chechnya and Georgia, then Crimea just like how we thought Germany would stop after Czechoslovakia. Bullies don&#39;t stop when you concede and show weakness. They get emboldened and strike again. You have to hit them back where it hurts if you want them to stop.
