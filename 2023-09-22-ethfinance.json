Solana VM is certainly the second most popular development environment and has a lot going on for it (like clever ways to price transactions to get around throughput bottlenecks). So having it run on top of Ethereum is a great way to bring on more SVM and rust devs. Now, certainly some devs are into Solana for reasons beyond the VM. Still the portability between Ethereum and Solana that Eclipse is promising is a win for everybody.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve heard some people on CT be cynical about ZK roll-ups recently though. And that&#39;s an interesting topic but has nothing to do with SVM of course.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-09-22 10:11:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k1ql6jz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_16p1i17","parent_id":"t1_k1q3sj5","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/16withScars","body":"Blends plenty of bleeding edge tech into one product so excited about it.
