But if you can get a 30 year mortgage at 2.7% like they were giving out in 2020, that's when this strategy becomes relevant. Let's further assume you want to leave your $1M in ETH untouched for the time being - that's for later price appreciation and to help pay off the mortgage more than a decade from now, so we completely forget about the ETH for now.\n\nSo you have $1M invested in a stock index fund, and you sell $500k of it to buy a $500k house. We should be able to agree that stocks return 10% on average, and US residential real estate returns 10% on average if you factor in all the money you save by not paying rent.\n\nSo in this transaction, we traded $500k of 10% returns on stocks for $500k of 10% returns on real estate. Our portfolio is neutral, aside from being perhaps a bit better diversified and thus less volatile, and part of our investment return coming from rent savings / equity building. On average, our portfolio will kick off the same level of returns as before.\n\nNow that we bought the house cash, we compare three options:\n\n1. Find riskier investments for the other $500k. You don't want to overconcentrate in ETH, and you're not good at stock picking so nothing else really beats the 10% return of the stock market. You could buy a tech index or something else high-beta, but there's a possibility that tech will fall out of relative favor over the decades - you'd rather your stocks be as diversified as possible. So I think it's hard to make the case to shift to a more risky investment class, but I welcome any ideas you have.\n\n2. Use margin to lever up the $500k stocks with a reasonable margin LTV like 20%, at 1.5% interest cost. At 20% LTV my mental math says maybe you can juice out nearly 12% from your $500k leveraged index fund investment if we're being very generous. You don't want to go much more than 20% LTV because there's a risk of being margin called during a stock market panic, and margin call is certain ruin for your portfolio. You also take on some interest rate risk, which you don't take on with a fixed rate mortgage.\n\n3. Take out a fixed rate 30 year mortgage against the $500k house with a reasonable mortgage LTV like 80%, at 3% interest cost, then add ($400k) to the stock investment. I don't really feel like running through the calculation but this definitely juices your long term stock returns closer to 15-17% on your original $500k, even after accounting for the mortgage interest. The high LTV is fine, because it's very unlikely that the stock market will be down more than say 50% for any consecutive ten year period. With a 30 year mortgage, you'll still be able to easily survive in 99% of markets over a 10 year period, still not even accounting for your ETH nor any income you're able to generate by coming out of retirement. This portfolio earns you an additional $15-25k/yr or more compared to even scenario 2, based on my rough mental math.\n\n> Ideally you don't probably don't want to pay off the loan at all unless your circumstances change.\n\nIdeally for the investor there would be perpetual interest-only mortgage products available, but there are not. As an investor you can approximate it by refinancing every ten years or so.\n\n> There seem to be quite a few ways to borrow against assets, both the house and the stuff in the brokerage account.\n\nBorrowing against the house is the safer bet for your portfolio, I would argue.\n\n> But from the lender's point of view, lending to a gambler who wants more leverage to the point of betting their house is going to be a really different risk proposition to lending someone who needs a house and wants to pay it off out of income a little bit at a time.\n\nI would argue the working person is much more of a gambler in this scenario. They gamble with their fitness to maintain their salary without having any stretches of sickness or disability that wipe them out, which are common in a relative sense.\n\nIn contrast, the portfolio holder gambles only with the very small possibility that stock indexes will undergo a completely unprecedented black swan event, or at least that there will not be a second Great Depression beginning in the year that they take out their mortgage. The responsible portfolio borrower, and thus the mortgage lender, is insulated from any personal health or employment issues keeping them from being able to pay the mortgage. Hell, the person could be dead and the mortgage would probably still be autopaid out of their estate.\n\nIn summary, I believe:\n\n* Mortgage borrowing has a better risk/reward ratio for the borrower than margin borrowing does.\n* You can't add much more beta to an unleveraged stock investment without stock picking or going into exotic assets, which is not something most people can do effectively (notwithstanding that we're all experts in ETH here).\n* You can't add too much margin to a stock portfolio without introducing a lot of risk, so the benefit of margin index investing is limited.\n* You can add a LOT of leverage to real estate without introducing a lot of risk, so the benefit of mortgage leverage is much higher.\n* To the extent that lending to a portfolio holder is actually more risky for a lender than lending to a wage earner, it all comes down to portfolios being easier to mismanage than income streams. If you have someone who manages a portfolio properly (by applying modern portfolio theory), lending to them will always be less risky than lending to someone who manages their income properly (by opening a savings account). And certainly less risky than someone who manages their income improperly, i.e. fritters all their extra money away and keeps no rainy day savings.\n\nAnd of course none of that is to mention the ETH on top, which adds an extra cushion to the whole scenario.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>You should be able to get the same effect by not gambling the value of the house, but instead making higher-risk investments with the other $1.5M.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s assume for this example that we&#39;re in a low rate environment, because if mortgage rates are 8% none of this matters and you just forego the expensive mortgage and call it a day.

You don&#39;t want to go much more than 20% LTV because there&#39;s a risk of being margin called during a stock market panic, and margin call is certain ruin for your portfolio. You also take on some interest rate risk, which you don&#39;t take on with a fixed rate mortgage.</p></li>\n<li><p>Take out a fixed rate 30 year mortgage against the $500k house with a reasonable mortgage LTV like 80%, at 3% interest cost, then add ($400k) to the stock investment. I don&#39;t really feel like running through the calculation but this definitely juices your long term stock returns closer to 15-17% on your original $500k, even after accounting for the mortgage interest. The high LTV is fine, because it&#39;s very unlikely that the stock market will be down more than say 50% for any consecutive ten year period. With a 30 year mortgage, you&#39;ll still be able to easily survive in 99% of markets over a 10 year period, still not even accounting for your ETH nor any income you&#39;re able to generate by coming out of retirement. This portfolio earns you an additional $15-25k/yr or more compared to even scenario 2, based on my rough mental math.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ideally you don&#39;t probably don&#39;t want to pay off the loan at all unless your circumstances change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ideally for the investor there would be perpetual interest-only mortgage products available, but there are not. As an investor you can approximate it by refinancing every ten years or so.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There seem to be quite a few ways to borrow against assets, both the house and the stuff in the brokerage account.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Borrowing against the house is the safer bet for your portfolio, I would argue.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But from the lender&#39;s point of view, lending to a gambler who wants more leverage to the point of betting their house is going to be a really different risk proposition to lending someone who needs a house and wants to pay it off out of income a little bit at a time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would argue the working person is much more of a gambler in this scenario. They gamble with their fitness to maintain their salary without having any stretches of sickness or disability that wipe them out, which are common in a relative sense.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the portfolio holder gambles only with the very small possibility that stock indexes will undergo a completely unprecedented black swan event, or at least that there will not be a second Great Depression beginning in the year that they take out their mortgage. The responsible portfolio borrower, and thus the mortgage lender, is insulated from any personal health or employment issues keeping them from being able to pay the mortgage. Hell, the person could be dead and the mortgage would probably still be autopaid out of their estate.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, I believe:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mortgage borrowing has a better risk/reward ratio for the borrower than margin borrowing does.</li>\n<li>You can&#39;t add much more beta to an unleveraged stock investment without stock picking or going into exotic assets, which is not something most people can do effectively (notwithstanding that we&#39;re all experts in ETH here).</li>\n<li>You can&#39;t add too much margin to a stock portfolio without introducing a lot of risk, so the benefit of margin index investing is limited.</li>\n<li>You can add a LOT of leverage to real estate without introducing a lot of risk, so the benefit of mortgage leverage is much higher.</li>\n<li>To the extent that lending to a portfolio holder is actually more risky for a lender than lending to a wage earner, it all comes down to portfolios being easier to mismanage than income streams. If you have someone who manages a portfolio properly (by applying modern portfolio theory), lending to them will always be less risky than lending to someone who manages their income properly (by opening a savings account). And certainly less risky than someone who manages their income improperly, i.e. fritters all their extra money away and keeps no rainy day savings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And of course none of that is to mention the ETH on top, which adds an extra cushion to the whole scenario.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-09-23 23:50:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k1ymd6m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_16pvjq0","parent_id":"t1_k1ygei4","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/edmundedgar","body":"> Let's assume for this example that we're in a low rate environment...
