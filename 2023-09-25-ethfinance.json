Obviously the supply shock from burning Ether will be more than just a meme.   \nIndependent of the Merge Ethereum has made some decisions in the past that are coming to fruition. The biggest change was to focus on the rollup centric roadmap.

This already results in low fees on execution layers like Optimism or zksync and with EIP 4844 the cost might be cut by another 10x. With this fork below cent transactions will be achievable in the Ethereum ecosystem. Eliminating high fees - which were a major pain point last cycle - will allow for new use cases and user adoption.

I was basically wondering why it was so important to run your own node (from a conversation we were having regarding Ethereum vs. Solana). \n\nI knew that it saves you during times of high activity, but other than that all I\u2019ve ever heard is that by running your own node you can verify that all the txns in the history of the chain were valid. But like really? If I download a client and it tells me the next day that it has synced, I\u2019m 100% trusting that it\u2019s telling me the truth. I can\u2019t read code, so I\u2019m no better off than I was using an Infura rpc. \n\nBut my friend then opened my eyes. He said that Ethereum not having a culture of people running their own nodes is \u201cthe single biggest hole in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized model. By a pretty large margin.\u201d \n\nWhy?\n\nIf you don't have your own node (or a light node in the future), you're relying on RPC nodes from like Infura or Alchemy to tell you the state of all of Ethereum. \n\n\u201cThey can basically show you any values on any dapp that they want. With just a semi-sophisticated attack they could make you sign transactions that did something completely different than you expected. They could make you think that you are voting with your favourite peers in governance votes. They could fake ENS addresses so you send money to their address instead of the owner of the ENS.

I was basically wondering why it was so important to run your own node (from a conversation we were having regarding Ethereum vs. Solana). </p>\n\n<p>I knew that it saves you during times of high activity, but other than that all I\u2019ve ever heard is that by running your own node you can verify that all the txns in the history of the chain were valid. But like really? If I download a client and it tells me the next day that it has synced, I\u2019m 100% trusting that it\u2019s telling me the truth. I can\u2019t read code, so I\u2019m no better off than I was using an Infura rpc. </p>\n\n<p>But my friend then opened my eyes.
