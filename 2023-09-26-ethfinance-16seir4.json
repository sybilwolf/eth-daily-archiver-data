Nothing really worked due to quite a few mistakes in the configuration. After manually changing the execution layer configuration 2.5 hours after genesis a first block was proposed. Shortly afterwards, it was decided to restart Holesky on the 28th of September with proper configurations this time.

Most remaining teams have shut down their node to prepare for the new Holesky testnet genesis this Thursday.\n- With the low participation rate the testnet is in an unrecoverable death spiral. It goes like this. Offline validators leak ETH, online ones as well but slightly less. Once the first validators are down to 28 ETH effective balance they will get ejected but have to go to the exit queue. It will take over a year to exit 1.3 million validators. During that time these validators still have attestation and block proposal duties. Slightly reduces ones due to their [lower effective balance](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/balances/#economic-aspects-of-effective-balance). This means we will still have non-finality for a long time and the missing blocks will also lead to online validators to continuously leak . Once the online validators reach 28 ETH effective balance they will be put in the exit queue as well. This will lead to no validators being left to actually keep the network alive. \nIn addition to over 90% of the network being offline, the death spiral might mostly be due to the change in ejection balance from 16 ETH to 28 ETH for the Holesky testnet. I am not sure if this behaviour could also be observed on mainnet.\n- Nimbus is an absolute beast of a consensus client. Even during this extended non-finality of the network Nimbus uses just 4.5 Gb of RAM and only about half a CPU core on my asus PN51 with 2400 validators. Same on my Orange Pi 5+ ARM minicomputer with 100 validators it is not sweating even a little bit. After about 1 week of non-finality I had to begin restarting nimbus regularly to not fall behind the head block. This is probably due to most of the remaining nodes being switched off for the upcoming regenesis.\nI still remember the non-finality on the Medalla testnet 3 years ago. Back then Prysm and Lighthouse were eating my RAM and CPU like there was no tomorrow. The consensus clients have come a long way.\n- Teku seems to have more issues with this extended non-finality. I could not run it anymore after a few days. I have not investigate the reason for this. I have not tried other clients. As far as I heard Ligthhouse also stopped working after a few days. Lodestar held through a bit longer.\n- Even though Ethereum does not have centralized control over its network, we, some rocket pool node operators, were able to coordinate a rescue within an hour after the solution was possible. Sure, most larger operators did not care as there was no money on the line, but a few geeks geeked out and we could show that the network is actually recoverable if we would have wanted to.\n- And personally I learned so much about fixing failing nodes by reconfiguring eth-docker on the fly. I feel much more confident that my nodes can contribute to a stable Holesky testnet than I did 2 weeks ago.\n  \nWith all this, I finally switch off my Holesky-Classic nodes and prepare for the relaunch of Holesky on Thursday.
