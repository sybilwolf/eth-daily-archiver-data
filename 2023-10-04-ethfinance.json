As always I'll summarize numbers and share my thoughts but I am also looking forward to your comments. \n\n  \n**Validator overview - total: 916037 validators\\***\n\n* 840554 active (September: 772860; +67694 / +8,7%, | May: 554322; +286232 / +51,6%)\n* 9685 pending (September: 49562; -39877 / -80,4% | May: 15537; -5852 / -37,6%)\n* 0 exiting (September: 0; 0 / +/-0% | May: 7333; -7333 / -100%)\n* 105145 exited (September: 93532; +11613 / +12,4% | May: 39341; +65804 / +167%)\n\nUntil now the validator count was up only, this might change soon. The number of active validators is at an all time high. But as you probably know, the entry queue is down only since a few weeks. The number of pending validators is the lowest of the last 6 months, or in other words: now is the best time to get your validator live if you don't want to wait and I think we can expect an \"empty\" entry queue soon (\"empty\", cause we might have a very small number of entries always, but waiting time might be hours instead of days or even weeks). \n\nInteresting from my point if view: Every month there are more or less 10.000 validators exiting. Slashing is basically never the reason, 99,7% are voluntary exists. So with 10.000 new entries the number of active validators will be stable, but because of the entry queue I guess at least next month there still will be growth. \n\n  \n**Client diversity numbers\\*\\***  \n**Consensus**\n\n* Prysm 45% (September: 46%, May: 38%)\n* Lighthouse 33% (September: 33%, May: 37%)\n* Teku 16% (September: 14%, May: 17%)\n* Nimbus 5% (September: 5%, May: 6%)\n* Lodestar 1% (September: 1%, May: 1%)\n\n  \n**Execution**\n\n* Geth 84% (September: 84%)\n* Nethermind 7% (September: 7%)\n* Erigon 2% (September: 2%)\n* Besu 5% (September: 5%)\n\nConsensus clients are doing okay, Prysm is still a little too high, but slightly decreasing. Lighthouse, teku and nimbus all have a healthy share. \n\nThe most important issue right now is geth dominance. If you haven't read last [months update](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/169imcm/comment/jz31pts/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) you might be confused. Geth usage seemed to be down before, even crossing the 50% mark? That is correct, but the data seemed to be off, so [https://clientdiversity.org/](https://clientdiversity.org/) as the source for this report changed to more reliable data. \n\nGeht dominance is too high, we need to change this. I have made the switch on Monday and now run nethermind. If you run a validator please change your execution client if you use geth until now. I am a total noob and if I can do it, you can do as well! Please: \n\n>***Switch from Geth to a minority client!***\n\nI am sure the people over at r/ethstaker (on reddit, but also discord) will be happy to help you migrate. It was scary for me, but as always there were so many helpful people and in the end it really isn't that difficult. \n\n  \n**Pool distribution\\*\\*\\***\n\n* Lido 32,3% (September: 32,4%)\n* Coinbase 8,1% (September: 8,6%)\n* Binance 4,2% (September: 4,5%)\n* Kraken 3,0% (September: 3,0%)\n* Rocket Pool 3,0% (September: 3,0%)  \n\\+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc.\n\nPool distribution is still a concern for a lot of people. Most of you are aware of this anyways, cause it has been *the* topic the past days and weeks in this sub. Lido is close to the magical 33% mark, but at least didn't gain market share in the past weeks. \n\nGood thing: Other centralized (CEX) pools are losing market share while Rocket Pool is stable. \n\nBut wait? How is this possible? Who gains market share, if all these LSDs lose? The answer is staking providers like Figment, Kiln and Staked. Especially Kiln has seen incredible growth in the past 6 months (+800% ETH staked!). These players obviously aren't great either... \n\nLet's hope that new technology and new protocols like DIVA help improve the pool distribution. Since you soon should be able to validate with less than 32 ETH, this could a positive impact. And obviously in a best case scenario if you have 32 ETH, you just stake it instead of using a pool/ LST provider. Again: It might be scary in the beginning, but it really isn't that hard.  \nAll percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.\n\n  \n\\* https://beaconcha.in/validators#all  \n\\*\\* https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution  \n\\*\\*\\* https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Here&#39;s the sixth edition of the monthly staking update</strong><br/>\n(not to be confused with the beautiful daily staking update)</p>\n\n<p>The Monthly Staking Update is back with a mini delay caused by the good folks in &quot;my&quot; government granting me a bank holiday and a long weekend.

So with 10.000 new entries the number of active validators will be stable, but because of the entry queue I guess at least next month there still will be growth. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Client diversity numbers*\\</strong>*<br/>\n<strong>Consensus</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Prysm 45% (September: 46%, May: 38%)</li>\n<li>Lighthouse 33% (September: 33%, May: 37%)</li>\n<li>Teku 16% (September: 14%, May: 17%)</li>\n<li>Nimbus 5% (September: 5%, May: 6%)</li>\n<li>Lodestar 1% (September: 1%, May: 1%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Execution</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Geth 84% (September: 84%)</li>\n<li>Nethermind 7% (September: 7%)</li>\n<li>Erigon 2% (September: 2%)</li>\n<li>Besu 5% (September: 5%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Consensus clients are doing okay, Prysm is still a little too high, but slightly decreasing. Lighthouse, teku and nimbus all have a healthy share. </p>\n\n<p>The most important issue right now is geth dominance. If you haven&#39;t read last <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/169imcm/comment/jz31pts/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">months update</a> you might be confused. Geth usage seemed to be down before, even crossing the 50% mark? That is correct, but the data seemed to be off, so <a href=\"https://clientdiversity.org/\">https://clientdiversity.org/</a> as the source for this report changed to more reliable data. </p>\n\n<p>Geht dominance is too high, we need to change this. I have made the switch on Monday and now run nethermind. If you run a validator please change your execution client if you use geth until now. I am a total noob and if I can do it, you can do as well! Please: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Switch from Geth to a minority client!</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am sure the people over at <a href=\"/r/ethstaker\">r/ethstaker</a> (on reddit, but also discord) will be happy to help you migrate. It was scary for me, but as always there were so many helpful people and in the end it really isn&#39;t that difficult. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Pool distribution**\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lido 32,3% (September: 32,4%)</li>\n<li>Coinbase 8,1% (September: 8,6%)</li>\n<li>Binance 4,2% (September: 4,5%)</li>\n<li>Kraken 3,0% (September: 3,0%)</li>\n<li>Rocket Pool 3,0% (September: 3,0%)<br/>\n+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Pool distribution is still a concern for a lot of people. Most of you are aware of this anyways, cause it has been <em>the</em> topic the past days and weeks in this sub. Lido is close to the magical 33% mark, but at least didn&#39;t gain market share in the past weeks. </p>\n\n<p>Good thing: Other centralized (CEX) pools are losing market share while Rocket Pool is stable. </p>\n\n<p>But wait? How is this possible? Who gains market share, if all these LSDs lose? The answer is staking providers like Figment, Kiln and Staked. Especially Kiln has seen incredible growth in the past 6 months (+800% ETH staked!). These players obviously aren&#39;t great either... </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s hope that new technology and new protocols like DIVA help improve the pool distribution. Since you soon should be able to validate with less than 32 ETH, this could a positive impact. And obviously in a best case scenario if you have 32 ETH, you just stake it instead of using a pool/ LST provider. Again: It might be scary in the beginning, but it really isn&#39;t that hard.<br/>\nAll percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>* <a href=\"https://beaconcha.in/validators#all\">https://beaconcha.in/validators#all</a><br/>\n** <a href=\"https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution\">https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution</a><br/>\n*** <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking\">https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-10-04 03:09:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k3eqi84","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_16ze8g1","parent_id":"t3_16ze8g1","score":25,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Zeebrasurfer","body":"Love these.
