The standard thing at stake for almost every protocol, whether on-chain or chain-adjacent, is some provably scarce token that is subject to some kind of slashing condition. I commonly see this referred to as stake but that term is often overloaded. I call it hostage collateral. It exists to harm you in the event of misbehavior and it enables a system to trust some anon to make good on some kind of promise. The thing about hostage collateral today is we're really overpaying for it as a whole ecosystem.\n\nThe final APR you pay a service provider includes:\n\n1) Operational costs of providing the service (operator time, equipment, power, etc).\n\n2) Contract risk. See my [usual trust framework](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/monetizing-honesty).\n\n3) Price risk of collateral. You either believe the collateral is going to outperform ETH or you're paying me for how much money I'm expecting to lose holding your token. For example, looking at Secret or Regen Network's price does not inspire confidence that the tokens I'm being paid in are going to even outweigh the monetary loss over time of my stake.\n\n4) Time cost of money. If the hostage collateral isn't inherently interesting bearing, you're going to have to make that opportunity cost up to me. Right now that's about 4% for ETH because of staking yield and 5% for USD because the Fed says so. I sure as hell wouldn't be a Chainlink node for 3% when I could make 4% staking ETH. Most service APRs today have a rate floor of the ETH staking rate.\n\nWhen I look at most L1's and chain-adjacent services today, even useful ones like Filecoin and Chainlink, and I see native token collateral in their tokenomic designs I just think how seasonal the designs we have today are going to look in another 5 years. In the same way no one makes utility tokens or ohm forks any more, no one in their right mind is going to launch a native collateral token in 5 years.\n\nInstead all hostage collateral is going to migrate towards lower risk and interest bearing assets over time. This directly affects the latter two costs of your APR. In many cases, these costs dominate the service costs. An interest bearing form of ETH is obviously going to be a ubiquitous hostage collateral. I also wouldn't be surprised to see centralized and decentralized interest bearing tokens like aUSDC or some riskier thing like a stablecoin Concentrator LP position as a collateral option as well. There's an obvious tradeoff here for the smart contract risk versus yield that is reflected in the risk curve for Defi. \n\nNothing states that a protocol needs to be limited to one hostage collateral type or that hostage collateral can't be reused. Unlike deposit collateral which is locked to secure something like a loan in Defi, hostage collateral isn't owed to anyone. It's just there so you have something to lose, it doesn't have to be used to make someone else whole for whatever commitment you made and failed to fulfill. ETH from a misbehaving validator is just slashed, not given to whomever you inconvenienced. Because of this you can reuse hostage collateral several times and it still remains effective as long as you can be actively evicted from other services when your collateral is forfeited. This gives rise to restaking as a service rather than just swapping out a collateral contract pointer in all your applications. Just as Gearbox is able to outsource deposit collateral from applications like GMX, restaking services such as EigenLayer are going to outsource hostage collateral from everywhere else. Every protocol will be able to describe both what collaterals they accept and the limits of how else that collateral is used. This will consolidate value to the collaterals the market settles on (making Ethereum more secure if done right) and increase effective APR while driving the cost of each service down towards the operational and contract risk costs.\n\nOn the ETH side I hope we'll see a bunch of competing restaking protocols just like we see a bunch of competing LSTs and protocols built on top of them. For decentralization, we definitely want to keep the amount of ETH staked in any given restaking service below 33% of all staked ETH. If the liquidity for this eventually resembles the stablecoins or LST's then the consolidation of collateral towards ETH should provide the Ethereum network stronger economic security. Pricewise, ETH and maybe a stablecoin or two will be winners from this. The losers will be everyone else currently using other hostage collaterals.\n\nWhether you are bootstrapping a project today or whether you already launched your collateral token you have to start designing for this paradigm shift **now**. You simply can't afford not to. This is both because you are overpaying for services right now and because if you don't someone is going to quickly fork you and vampire attack you with the cost delta of services you are overpaying for and their new token which is just a claim on system profit somewhere. Someone industrious is going to do this first, people will see how easy it is to do, and then we're going to have another food token situation on our hands with wave after wave of grifters coming in trying to steal the landscape from the people who put in a lot of hard work making the hard software for all the services the hostage collateral is securing. This is an existential threat to most of the web3 ecosystem we have today. If you're a web3 developer, start preparing **now**.\n\nP.S. You just know someone is going to do the Lido thing and create a centralized service that escrows your collateral and maxes it out with every service they can restake it on to maximize your APR. They'll tokenize the deposit, take a fee on top of the operational costs, and we'll be sitting on a new form of LST for all the major hostage collateral types. Could be a good business idea for one of you to get started on if you haven't already.\n\nP.P.S.

So, I should clarify all statements below are more theoretical. As, in fairness to Lido, they have not actually done anything to influence the election and are simply requesting funds within the guidelines provided by the DAO. \n\nThe flaw, IMO, is a scenario where a project can buy their way into a winning vote that gives a direct benefit to them which they would not have otherwise won. This especially becomes a problem if the vote is for something that really doesn't benefit the DAO, or the alternative use of those funds would have been more beneficial going to other projects. \n\nIn this specific scenario, the grant program has limited funding and if all projects passed there would not be enough funds to go around to all of them. A project in the running could vote yes on their proposal, and no on every other single proposal to hedge the results in their favor. Taking funds from projects that might have otherwise won and might have otherwise provided more value to Arbitrum. Or if they wanted to be more targeted, they could use that power to reject proposals that would have otherwise benefited competitors. Plus, it comes into question if this scenario then represents the 'true' will of the people. \n\nNow, it's fair to take the 'code is law' approach - if you buy the votes you are working within the system provided. You are 'the people', in the way a large shareholder of a company might have more influence. There are also questions of censorship and where to mark that line in the sand. And ultimately it is pretty much an unsolvable problem (you can just make a dummy wallet / delegate to a middle-man). \n\nI just think the flaw is more a discussion on what is best for how a DAO should ideally operate. Does the credibility of the DAO come into question if projects can just buy their way into a grant payout? In an extreme example, does this create an attack vector where a bad-actor can just unilaterally vote to distribute the whole treasury to themselves - whether to monetarily benefit or to take out another project?  Do others lose faith in the project because they feel their votes matter even less? Is there a security threat, if this power is used to vote your people into a position of power (multi-sig, council positions)? \n\nMaybe this specific scenario isn't too bad, but would your opinion change if Lido were to buy a ton of Rocket pool and start influencing votes in competing projects?\n\nIt's a highly opinionated thing, for sure. And I won't deny it's probably the conservative take filled with massive gray areas. But, the tl;dr is simply that I think voting to directly benefit yourself does more harm than good within the DAO space.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>First, I&#39;ll emphasize that as far as I am aware, Lido has not voted. So, I should clarify all statements below are more theoretical. As, in fairness to Lido, they have not actually done anything to influence the election and are simply requesting funds within the guidelines provided by the DAO. </p>\n\n<p>The flaw, IMO, is a scenario where a project can buy their way into a winning vote that gives a direct benefit to them which they would not have otherwise won. This especially becomes a problem if the vote is for something that really doesn&#39;t benefit the DAO, or the alternative use of those funds would have been more beneficial going to other projects. </p>\n\n<p>In this specific scenario, the grant program has limited funding and if all projects passed there would not be enough funds to go around to all of them. A project in the running could vote yes on their proposal, and no on every other single proposal to hedge the results in their favor. Taking funds from projects that might have otherwise won and might have otherwise provided more value to Arbitrum. Or if they wanted to be more targeted, they could use that power to reject proposals that would have otherwise benefited competitors. Plus, it comes into question if this scenario then represents the &#39;true&#39; will of the people. </p>\n\n<p>Now, it&#39;s fair to take the &#39;code is law&#39; approach - if you buy the votes you are working within the system provided. You are &#39;the people&#39;, in the way a large shareholder of a company might have more influence. There are also questions of censorship and where to mark that line in the sand. And ultimately it is pretty much an unsolvable problem (you can just make a dummy wallet / delegate to a middle-man). </p>\n\n<p>I just think the flaw is more a discussion on what is best for how a DAO should ideally operate. Does the credibility of the DAO come into question if projects can just buy their way into a grant payout? In an extreme example, does this create an attack vector where a bad-actor can just unilaterally vote to distribute the whole treasury to themselves - whether to monetarily benefit or to take out another project?  Do others lose faith in the project because they feel their votes matter even less?
