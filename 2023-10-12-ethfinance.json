I play around with some Bitcoin to buy something online through the Coinbase wallet on my phone. I forget about it until 2017. Randomly, I re-open the app when I notice I have more than twice as much money (in USD terms) than I put in! What the \\*hell\\* is this stuff? Next thing I know I'm researching cryptocurrencies: How they function, why anyone would seriously use them, what problems they solve and so on. Then it hits me... maybe there are more of them? Maybe they could be used to do more complex operations? Maybe one that doesn't kill the planet by simply existing? But let's be real, part of the excitement is the extra money I now have.  \n\n\nWhich of course leads me to \"discover\" Ethereum. Even in the early days, there was so much promise. PoS systems (Casper FFG!) were being discussed to get off of PoW. Obviously smart contracts with their huge potential. But above all else, transparency of being a decentralized, open source network, just like Bitcoin made me commit long term. The ethos and vision was in the right place.

I missed the chance with Bitcoin and I wouldn't miss it this time. It'd be fun and it could even be lucrative. Even back then, the commitment to Bitcoin mining and actually getting some rewards from it wasn't really possible for someone like me. Hardware and electricity requirements didn't sit well with me either, but staking? That's the future. If the stars aligned, it would be a super exciting series of events. A lot could go wrong along the way and the risk was high... but why not risk what I'm willing to lose?  \n\n\nAnd then... somehow... it all really happened. Three long years of waiting and a lot of changes to how staking would manifest but The Beacon Chain \\*did\\* come to life. I was a genesis validator! I was helping validate the network while earning some passive income along the way! Well, sorta. It was all locked up with the promise that maybe, one day it would be unlocked. Until then, I just hoped it worked out, like always. Still pretty risky but that was part of the fun. It's not like transactions were really being verified anyway. Then one day I started getting execution rewards...   \n\n\nTwo more years. Arguably the most exciting moment in Ethereum history comes to pass in 2022: The Merge. The true promise of Ethereum, a decentralized smart contract platform that by any objective account is now more robust and more useful than Bitcoin, became a full reality. No longer do we need to kill the planet for a cryptocurrency. Obviously \\*now\\*, people will realize Ethereum's true potential and Bitcoin to be put to pasture. And with the burn and the triple halvening... oh boy, get ready.  \n\n\nBut then... the excitement went away and the price with it. It's 2023 and what is there to be excited about? Technical cleanup? Speeding up the network? More privacy features? Anyone in the tech industry knows that tech debt is the least sexiest of problems to deal with. All of the price action optimism ended with barely keeping the ratio afloat. The market still treats Ethereum as second class citizen to Bitcoin despite it's successes and changes over the years. The thesis around supply and demand dynamics basically never materialized, or maybe the demand just went away?   \n\n\nI'm still invested in Ethereum, but as forces work to centralize it, I wonder if I should have left a while ago when things were more exciting?

Probably not. Why would it? Too many regular people got involved and got burned by the likes of FTX, Celsius among others. The public was switched on then turned off.

Randomly, I re-open the app when I notice I have more than twice as much money (in USD terms) than I put in! What the *hell* is this stuff? Next thing I know I&#39;m researching cryptocurrencies: How they function, why anyone would seriously use them, what problems they solve and so on. Then it hits me... maybe there are more of them?
