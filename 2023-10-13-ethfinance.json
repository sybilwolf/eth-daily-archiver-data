Everyone likes it when you say thanks, and everyone prefers it when they don't feel like you forget about them after you've got what you wanted.\n\nIf delegates voted no after you messaged them, or even if no one contacted them then why not message them to suggest they take a look in EthFinance of Reddit? Sales teams and political lobbying groups take people out to dinner to keep them on side, maybe our equivalent to that would be inviting delegates here... I honestly think that The Daily is a more valuable Ethereum community than any Discord or Telegram group, so why not leverage some of that value to buy goodwill from DAO delegates who have shown themselves to be at least somewhat aligned to the cause of protecting Ethereum L1.\n\n**3) Next Week** - With Lido losing here, being vampire attacked, and the threat they pose being discussed in multiple Ethereum podcasts recently it's a good time to press the advantage. Up the 'social pressure' (which it turns out can be quite useful after all) by calling out their attempts at spin and damage control. u/hanniabu has set a great example of doing this.

Lido have a lot to think about at the moment so we'd be throwing away an advantage if we let the pressure up too much.\n\n**4) The Future** - We need to get more coordinated. We've got delegates in lots of DAOs but can we find more? Can we start compiling resources of delegates that might not be part of EthFinance but can be relied upon to recognize the threat Lido represents if they come knocking for funds and integrations? Can we start predicting where they might go next and reach out to delegates in other DAOs before any decisions even get put to them?\n\nu/_WebOfTrust has discussed the possibility of changes to constitutions that would prevent these kinds of funding requests for Lido even coming to the proposal stage, what would that look like and what DAO's might take it up?\n\nHow can we keep respected Ethereum media discussing this? Obviously some members (like u/EvanVanNess) are already working on that, I'm sure we can try to keep the focus on for some others too. The Bankless guys used to frequent here sometimes and have had a recent episode with Danny Ryan as well as promoted Diva's Vampire attack, lets praise and promote those positive actions to encourage them to do more.\n\nWe need to get to grips with how important votes in the ecosystem work, before the final day of their decisions - it was pretty funny the number of different interpretations as to how Arbitrum's pass/fail was decided, I certainly didn't understand it until yesterday evening. It worked out fine this time, but we can learn from that and do better next time.\n\nBecause there will be a next time.

Our aim is to preserve habitat by purchasing land of significant ecological value using funds generated by on-chain donations.\n\nThe landscape of Ethereum has obviously changed drastically since then, but our ideas and general plans were compiled by the great /u/haurog, and can be found at https://github.com/preservationdao/preservationdao.\n\nWe were quickly met with a wide array of challenges and obstacles. Some of these issues have likely been solved to some extent by this point.\n\nI will assume that any interested members have read the linked github page. The following will be an attempt to address some of these challenges, and to detail solutions where available.\n\n1. I personally lacked the funds necessary to get this project off the ground. Unfortunately, this has not changed.\n\n2. We felt it wrong to launch an environmentally-oriented project on a proof of work chain. Post-merge, this is a non-issue.
