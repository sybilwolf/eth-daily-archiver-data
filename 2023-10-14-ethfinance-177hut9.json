Why nobody gives a shit about NFTs any more?</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s because <strong>they never actually did anything uniquely useful for anybody</strong>.  They were just schemes to enrich early adopters based on marketing hype with zero substance.</p>\n\n<p>So again, who cares?  You still can&#39;t cite a goddam thing a NFT does that anybody in the real world gives a shit about.</p>\n\n<p>And where is this JP Morgan Onyx shit now?  That&#39;s 2+ years old.  Try to find any modern examples of <em>anybody</em> using that tech?  Where is it?  And how is it in any way better than what people have already been using?</p>\n\n<p>When you look into this crap, the only thing you find are <strong>press releases</strong>.  Where&#39;s the clientele?  Where&#39;s the actual commerce happening?  All these projects are just marketing blurbs with no substance.  I challenge you to prove otherwise.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-10-15 18:51:31","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-10-15 18:59:45","id":"k52764q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_177hut9","parent_id":"t1_k4twrec","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/696_eth","body":"I'm using it today.

Whether the \"price of crypto\" goes up, has absolutely no bearing on whether it's..\n\n a) A long term store of value\n\n b) Holds any intrinsic value or utility\n\n c) Or will return any value in the future\n \n One of the most important tenets of investing is the simple principal: ***Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.***  People in crypto seem willfully ignorant of this basic concept.\n \n2.  At best, the price of crypto is a function of *popularity*, not actual value or material utility.  For more on how and why crypto makes a much worse investment than almost anything else, see this [article](https://ioradio.org/i/value/). \n\n3.  The \"price of crypto\" is a heavily manipulated figure published by shady, [unregulated crypto exchanges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apklQgMauK4) that have systematically been caught [manipulating the market](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3D0dmTUCxLuQEJ39uyMFOP) from [then](https://www.investopedia.com/news/bots-drove-bitcoins-150to1000-rise-2013-paper/) to [now](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21).\n\n4.  Crypto bros love to harp about \"inflation\" in the fiat system, yet ironically they measure the \"value\" of their \"fiat alternative\" in fiat?  It makes absolutely no sense, unless you assume they haven't thought 2 seconds ahead from what comes out of their mouths.\n\n5.  It's the height of hypocrisy for crypto people to champion token deflation (and increased prices) while ignoring that there's over $160+ Billion in unsecured stablecoins being used to **inflate** the value of their tokens in the crypto marketplace. The \"code is law\" and \"don't trust - verify\" people seem perfectly willing to take companies like Tether and Circle, at face value, that they're telling the truth about asset reserves [when there's very little actual evidence](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21).\n\n6.  ***Not Your Fiat, Not Your Value*** - Just because you think the \"value of your crypto portfolio\" is worth $$$ *does not make that true.*  It's well known there's inadequate liquidity in this market, and most people will never be able to get their money out.  So UNLESS/UNTIL you can actually liquidate your crypto for actual real money, you have no idea what you have. You're \"down\" until you cash out.  Bernie Madoff's clients got monthly statements saying they were \"making money\" too.\n\n7.  Just because it's possible (though highly improbable) to make money speculating on crypto, this doesn't mean it's an **ethical** or reliable technique to amass wealth.  At its core, the notion that buying and holding crypto will generate reliable returns is [a de-facto ponzi scheme](https://ioradio.org/i/ponzi/).  **It's mathematically impossible for even a stastically-significant percentage of crypto holders to have any notable ROI.**  The rare exception of those who might profit in this market, do so while providing cover for everything from [cyber terrorism](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3026.html) to [human trafficking](https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/1/4/23539528/andrew-tate-arrest-jail-rape-human-trafficking).\n\n8.

[Here you go](https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22253079/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price-2021).
