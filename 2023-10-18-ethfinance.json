So I understand the critique regarding RCP on Ethereum. In a really decentralized and efficient manner there should be a smart contract which gives each contributor a fraction of ad revenue automatically without a centralized entity like Reddit taking full control. ETH or stablecoins could be used for this.</p>\n\n<p>... Funny enough the fact that DONUT from ethtrader has decided to NOT join the official RCP program has been a great decision!</p>\n\n<p>... The question is when decentralized social media on Ethereum will be a thing. Even the L2 transaction costs might be too high for posting and it is hard enough for a centralized social network to breach the oligopoly of social networks ... And here is the problem ... Reddit could have been this company which makes fundamental attempts to decentralize. But now this is more than unlikely to ever happen.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-10-18 10:29:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k5fh3p7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17aimuj","parent_id":"t1_k5eylfv","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/scheistermeister","body":"Lens protocol is doing a great thing and Phaver is killing it, with how they implement incentive mechanisms. \n\nTradSoc (lol) won\u2019t be able to pivot their models to accommodate the user over the advertisers.

First I will share the original brainstorm from u/superphiz which was more of a springboard than a \"let's do this\" fully fleshed out idea. Then below are my thoughts from a reply I made. I am just wanting to get other's opinions on the idea to see if we can make it viable without getting caught in the obvious pitfalls which led to hesitancy from others. The way I see it, we want our voices heard louder in the wider community and I think there will be a viable way for us to incentivise advocacy but finding the way to do it right is the challenge. So why don't we have a brainstorm?\n\n--------------------------\n\n>Random idea: The EVMavericks have a treasury and they've chatted about ways to use it to support the community. I think it makes sense to use some funds to commission a POAP. then deliver that POAP to the daily dooters and use some of the treasury to disperse.app some Eth to those POAP holders.\n\n>I'd obv be excluded since it's my idea, but I do think it has legs. For people who say this is similar to moons - it's not - this is curated, which brings much higher quality content.. and it's retroactive.\n\nI'm actually in support of your original idea. In my opinion, funds going to dooters, no matter how small is effectively just a form of retroactive public goods funding so I generally could get behind the idea. The danger is of course creating an incentive system like donuts. Especially with something as vague as \"being a dooter\" as the goal, it is clearly corruptible through the trust put in yours truly to fairly distribute the doots. So while I think your idea here is a tough sell, I do think it has legs.\n\nBear with me here while I try to build off of it. Let's say we do a POAP drop or maybe a dooter's score which is based of a quadratic function of someone's doot score (so the regulars don't get outsized power) as well as a minimum threshold/criteria to prevent sybil attacks (regular/recent contributions, account age, other sybil resistance protocols etc). Then, the EVMs could select collective goals sort of like with this recent Arbitrum Lido DAO vote. I think we should be incentivising our community to stand up and make our voices heard. So why not use the EVM treasury as an incentive for this? Retroactively reward the users who spoke out on the Arbitrum forum or delegated to No voters who are also on the doot list or anyone who has a dooted post on the topic.\n\nObviously this opens a whole can of worms with keeping the monetary incentives separate from this subreddit, preventing governance capture and of course the weak human link in the doot system which is me. Furthermore, I don't know what the EVM treasury is used for nor what its cash flow looks like so I wouldn't put much weight behind my opinion on that front.

First I will share the original brainstorm from <a href=\"/u/superphiz\">u/superphiz</a> which was more of a springboard than a &quot;let&#39;s do this&quot; fully fleshed out idea. Then below are my thoughts from a reply I made. I am just wanting to get other&#39;s opinions on the idea to see if we can make it viable without getting caught in the obvious pitfalls which led to hesitancy from others. The way I see it, we want our voices heard louder in the wider community and I think there will be a viable way for us to incentivise advocacy but finding the way to do it right is the challenge. So why don&#39;t we have a brainstorm?</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Random idea: The EVMavericks have a treasury and they&#39;ve chatted about ways to use it to support the community. I think it makes sense to use some funds to commission a POAP. then deliver that POAP to the daily dooters and use some of the treasury to disperse.app some Eth to those POAP holders.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d obv be excluded since it&#39;s my idea, but I do think it has legs. For people who say this is similar to moons - it&#39;s not - this is curated, which brings much higher quality content.. and it&#39;s retroactive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m actually in support of your original idea. In my opinion, funds going to dooters, no matter how small is effectively just a form of retroactive public goods funding so I generally could get behind the idea. The danger is of course creating an incentive system like donuts. Especially with something as vague as &quot;being a dooter&quot; as the goal, it is clearly corruptible through the trust put in yours truly to fairly distribute the doots. So while I think your idea here is a tough sell, I do think it has legs.</p>\n\n<p>Bear with me here while I try to build off of it. Let&#39;s say we do a POAP drop or maybe a dooter&#39;s score which is based of a quadratic function of someone&#39;s doot score (so the regulars don&#39;t get outsized power) as well as a minimum threshold/criteria to prevent sybil attacks (regular/recent contributions, account age, other sybil resistance protocols etc). Then, the EVMs could select collective goals sort of like with this recent Arbitrum Lido DAO vote. I think we should be incentivising our community to stand up and make our voices heard. So why not use the EVM treasury as an incentive for this? Retroactively reward the users who spoke out on the Arbitrum forum or delegated to No voters who are also on the doot list or anyone who has a dooted post on the topic.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously this opens a whole can of worms with keeping the monetary incentives separate from this subreddit, preventing governance capture and of course the weak human link in the doot system which is me.

In my opinion, funds going to dooters, no matter how small is effectively just a form of retroactive public goods funding so I generally could get behind the idea. The danger is of course creating an incentive system like donuts. Especially with something as vague as \"being a dooter\" as the goal, it is clearly corruptible through the trust put in yours truly. So while I think your idea here is a tough sell, I do think it has legs.\n\nBear with me here while I try to build off of it. Let's say we do a POAP drop or maybe a dooter's score which is based of a quadratic function of someone's doot score (so the regulars don't get outsized power) as well as a minimum threshold/criteria to prevent sybil attacks (regular/recent contributions, account age, other sybil resistance protocols etc). Then, the EVMs could select collective goals sort of like with this recent Arbitrum Lido DAO vote. I think we should be incentivising our community to stand up and make our voices heard. So why not use the EVM treasury as an incentive for this? Retroactively reward the users who spoke out on the Arbitrum forum or delegated to No voters who are also on the doot list or anyone who has a dooted post on the topic.\n\nObviously this opens a whole can of worms with keeping the monetary incentives separate from this subreddit, preventing governance capture and of course the weak human link in the doot system which is me.
