If you DO decide to join this testnet, I urge you to stick with it until it is retired.</p>\n\n<p>I was really slow to spin this one up, I think it launched in August and I just got around to it. The setup was pretty intuitive, but as an alpha there are some gotchas, the discord channel was pretty helpful. The biggest hangup for me is that you&#39;ll set a password when you run the installer, then you&#39;ll use that same password to log into the web interface later, but it&#39;s not called the same thing in both places and it can cause confusion.</p>\n\n<p>I get a little skittish about sharing things I find interesting because some folks attack me for promoting, but decentralizing the network is LITERALLY why I exist, so if someone doesn&#39;t like it they can suck my toe. If I&#39;m talking about it, there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s good for our network.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-10-20 07:41:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k5p20ka","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17c390i","parent_id":"t3_17c390i","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/dcdive","body":"Diva is pretty cool imo","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Diva is pretty cool imo</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-10-20 11:10:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k5q0a8m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17c390i","parent_id":"t1_k5p20ka","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/asdafari12","body":"Are node operators incentivized?

Long, personal, \"blogpost\".\n\n(1/2)\n\nA couple days ago, my Twitter timeline brought me this NFT free mint. I'm not usually one to care for that. It's even rare to see that stuff in my feed because I curate it all rather aggressively. \n\nHere, it piqued my interest. This happened on Scroll, and the idea looked cool enough: a version of Loot, with a spell scroll theme. \n\nIf you're unaware of Loot, it was this word-only NFT on Ethereum supposed to represent, well, items. A bespoke dapp, it generated a series of words with the intent for people to build on it however they wanted. The collection had 8000 NFTs which were claimable for free by anyone, save for ~200 the owner reserved for himself.\n\nLoot garnered some interest during the bull market, and those free mints quickly became coveted on the secondary market. They had a community of enthusiasts, many abiding by the vision of the creator, of taking this relatively blank slate and shaping concepts and lore around it.\n\nLet's get back to our spell scrolls. Compared to their predecessor, spells went for a tiered distribution: 441 airdropped to holders of certain projects I'm not quite aware of, 559 free mints. Then 1000 as paid mints, for a total supply of 2000.\n\nI had a vaguely positive opinion of the developer. Saw her pop up in public several times, seemed to talk sense and to be aligned with good stuff in general. This encouraged me enough to go for it. \n\nWell, perhaps some extra context is in order, actually. I was operating on maybe 3 hours of sleep, and when I don't get my beauty sleep I do dumb things with my crypto... \n\nFor starters, here I missed out that the paid mints were advertised straight away as 0.025 ETH per, which would have likely stopped me cold. More on that later.\n\nArmed with poor reading comprehension and the thrill of doing something on Scroll through scrollscan, I went and minted a spell scroll. An OpenSea clone provided the convenient interface to admire my newly owned incantation on its orange hue background. I liked it. TXs on Scroll are fast and cheap - good. I minted another one. Then another one.\n\nAt this point, my irremediable descent into spell addiction was well underway.\n\nBut I didn't want to mint them 1 by 1. I'd rather conjure a spell of my own! Giving me an excuse to touch Solidity and experience that Scroll ease-of-deployment I've been touting on here.\n\nI load up the apprentice mage's best friend (Remix IDE), look up at my saved contracts. I know I made a bulkminter sometimes last year for a collection of my own, a simple loop to mint. The spells were different from my NFTs, so I would need to tweak my spell. It didn't take too much work. I looked at the SpellScroll contract, ripped out everything I didn't need in my own bulkminter, then added a call to send the spells directly to my address. Test it in Remix - it works ! In just 5 minutes we were up on Scroll mainnet.\n\nBlockchain blocks contain a finite amount of space. This is true on Scroll just as much as Ethereum. If you try to fit more data into your transaction than a block can handle, you will bump into the gas limit. A naive loop like mine is bound to run into \"out of gas\" errors if we attempt to mint too many scrolls at a time. This is detected before the transaction, so it's not like you lose money for it. It simply means I had to do some guesswork for how many scrolls I could mint at once.\n\nSo I try 100. That's too many. Move it down to 50... This works! \n\nA couple seconds later, I see 50 spells trickling into my hoard at once. I can feel the magic. It really feels that way, when you craft a smart contract to interact with another smart contract in an unintended way and it works. Or at least it does, with my meager coding skills.\n\nI was curious to find out the exact max number I could mint, so did the usual dance: raise it to 60? \"out of gas\". Drop it to the middle point, 55? 55 worked. If I were levelheaded I would have kept trying numbers to find the exact one, but here I pressed the mint button. 55 more scrolls into my stash.\n\nSitting on a three figures stack of parchments, it seemed like a good time to call it a day.\n\nThen, as I look at my transactions on Scrollscan, I see this other address who started minting scrolls. Again and again. 1 by 1, manually.\n\nI start feeling this weird fomo. \"This guy is going to mint all the scrolls! He's going to hoard them all for profit. This will kill any fun to these scrolls.\"\n\nSo clearly the answer was for me to snatch them all instead...\n\nI figured I could find something more interesting to do with them, later. I mint 2 more batches of 56 (turns out 56 was the magic number, the maximum amount the loop could handle). There was still 100+ free scrolls available at this point, but I was sitting on 200+ already - and frankly, no idea yet of what to do with them. So I stepped away to grab a bite, and think.\n\nLast year, Lattice ran this Minecraft-inspired game completely onchain. It worked on their private testnet rollup, and it worked well! You could explore, mine blocks, build with them, in a collaborative shard shared with everyone else.\n\nMore interestingly, all the game logic is onchain. The official client bound you to certain conditions, physics like walking and jumping, but you could in theory design your own client where your character could fly at superspeed instead, or teleport.\n\nOr mine blocks telepathically.\n\nIn Minecraft, the most important currency is the diamond. Diamond blocks are very rare compared to most other blocks. \n\nOPcraft replicated that dynamic, and extended it. You could buy parcels of land in the world by spending diamonds. Once a parcel is yours, nobody else can build on it.\n\nSavvy coders found ways to detect diamond blocks anywhere on the whole map, and mine them for themselves. One such telepathic miner took it to the max. They accumulated a treasure trove of diamonds. With these diamonds, they bought out the entire chunks of land around the spawn point everyone starts from. Then, they revealed their existence to the public as \"SupremeLeaderOP\".\n\nTheir offer was simple. Join the Autonomous People's Republic of OPcraft, and you get to enjoy the benefits of building on their territory and to share their resources. On the other hand, joining involved a custom plugin transferring your own inventory in full to the government's inventory. You were offered a choice: trade your freedom for wealth.\n\nInsanely cool emergent gameplay.\n\nSo, I wasn't going to be able to match that with a few text NFTs, for sure. But this was the vibe that came to mind as worth emulating. The concept came of roleplaying a spell thief. Having gotten his hands on a hoard of scrolls, he would now attempt to unload them to anyone interested. Permissionlessly for a price, undercutting the official channels. To specific people manifesting their interest. As part of loose ARG games, enigmas, or requests for thematic content. \n\nI had a vibe, if no clear idea. At the moment I was enamored with it. Coming back, I saw the manual minter still hard at work. I mint 2 more batches of 56 to have even more scrolls to spread. This puts the current supply close to the free mint gap, and I leave it at that.\n\nNow if you looked at this from the point of view of a speculative play, this is all pretty stupid. I minted 332 scrolls to a single EOA address. The holder distribution looks extremely stacked on Scrollscan. There is no obfuscation of any sorts. In fact, I even have an Unstoppable Domain to my name tied to this address. This sort of was a secondary intent: I hoped someone would contact me to barter or discuss.\n\nThat hope manifested quickly. A few hours later, the dev messaged me on Twitter. Suggesting I should give a bunch to friends if I wanted scrolls to be worth anything.\n\nThis seemed promising! I thought I spotted interest in doing something fun with this. A succinct back-and-forth brought forward an offer to help from her end. I rolled with it and explained the above spell thief concept.\n\nWhich, to my surprise, got an answer I would qualify as \"lukewarm\" at best. It started to sound like the dev pegged me as someone out to make a buck. Perhaps not entirely unfair, it would be the rational assumption. But there didn't seem to be much interest on her end in engaging with the more creative aspects of the concept I brought forward. Beyond falling back to generic suggestions.\n\nThis focus on money again and again makes me start to rethink my footing. I picture from her side, the question is whether me having too much of the supply is too much of a hinderance. On top of that, several manual minters gathered a few dozen scrolls themselves. It's all pretty uneven. Perhaps the dev would choose to reploy the contract to a saner state. \n\nWhich, all in all, could be alright. When it comes to the few NFTs I enjoy, I like weird stuff with a whiff of controversy. If the spell scrolls became FORBIDDEN spell scrolls, their personal value as collectionables would increase for me.\n\nI figure we might as well go for broke. I expand with a novel-sized reply, on the various options and ideas I can think of. Cooperative stuff we could play out, too, like: the dev catching me in the act, designing a \"magic jail\" smart contract locking my spells for a year (technically, I would deposit them voluntarily). Or me transferring most spells to a \"spellbinding\" multisig, a 2/2 we'd both control, so we'd have to agree on the next move for these. Or running the back-of-the-truck smart contract specifically without an interface after the official site came out, to see how many people would go to the trouble of getting those stolen goods vs people interacting with the proper website.\n\nAt this point I also see the dev has gotten several sales and is in profit, so I mention if she wanted to buy me back for my gas costs, for the sake of getting rid of me, we could do that although that seemed the least interesting route.\n\nI press Send.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Musings on incentives.

Or running the back-of-the-truck smart contract specifically without an interface after the official site came out, to see how many people would go to the trouble of getting those stolen goods vs people interacting with the proper website.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I also see the dev has gotten several sales and is in profit, so I mention if she wanted to buy me back for my gas costs, for the sake of getting rid of me, we could do that although that seemed the least interesting route.</p>\n\n<p>I press Send.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-10-20 02:20:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k5o0izy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17c390i","parent_id":"t3_17c390i","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"(2/2)\n\nStriking out. \n\nI get a reply I can only summarize as dismissive at this point. Saying I can get bought out if I really want, but ignoring all the creative stuff or practical offers for cooperation.\n\nI'm sure anyone reading this could relate to how I feel at this particular point. You get enthusiastic about something. You put yourself out there with thoughts and ideas. You do that with someone you'd think would have reasonable motive to engage with the concept. And you get shut down with indifference, focusing on the most mundane aspects of the talk if any. We can't expect people to play the game with us, but it's a cold shower regardless.\n\nSo, whatever. With a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, I decline the buyback offer and reassert my preference to do what comes through my mind with these scrolls. Communication ends with a thumbs up.\n\nAll in all, my relation with the creator need not influence my plans. If I'm having fun with the concept, why should I let that stop me? The whole point of stuff like Loot, if we take it at face value, is the lore that can rise around it. In some ways, that lore is even enhanced, if it develops independently or even adversarially with the original developer. Founding myths work just as well with drama.\n\nIdeas come and go. I play with AI image generators and language models through the day, start exploring several routes for future content. There's a lot of interesting stuff and custom smart contracts I could see worth doing with this.\n\nBut then it hit me.\n\nThe paid mint price really hit me, that is.\n\n0.025 ETH per paid mint. 1000 paid supply. We are talking about 25 ETH for the developer if this sells out.\n\nThe SpellScroll contract itself is rather simple. It's a clone of the Loot contract. A couple functions related to rarity have been scrubbed out. Dictionaries are adjusted to form a complete sentence akin to an incantation, rather than the individual items forming a Loot NFT.\n\nIn layman's terms, there is some work but it is not a lot of work either. This is something that would take me (non-coder) a day to cook up. Someone experienced in Solidity, as the dev claims to be, would do that in 2 hours tops, maybe 1. \n\nAiming to get $40k for 2 hours of work, mostly copypasting something that was distributed for free, capitalizing on a new blockchain for hype.\n\nI'm not saying this to pass judgement on that dynamic itself. Rather, the thought went towards my own situation. It's one thing to feel foolish for getting excited about a topic only to get shut down. It would be another thing entirely for me to spend days, maybe even weeks, building content, games, stories, with no clear intent to profit financially, all the while I would build equity for a person that has been so far pretty dismissive if not hostile. For I figure any interest I could generate might translate into greater visibility, and sales for the dev. Talk about Suckertown, population: me.\n\nI don't want to paint this person as bad or anything. For all I know, perhaps she *is* planning to engage actively with her project in the future, to create actual content value whether through cooperation or solo.\n\nBut, there's also a tendency for engineers to be quite generous when it comes to self-compensation. Is \"do what you want with this project\" an appeal to self-expression, or an excuse to delegate the actual work to free labor? Or a mix of both? Is a particular DAO a structure to avoid decentralization, or for *a* structure to avoid responsibility? Is community-owned a grassroot effort, or target practice for sellers? In this space we are well-acquainted with the blurriness of those lines.\n\nI brought up the story with a friend, and her take came in a flash: \"of course you shouldn't make all that content, you're not her slave\". Now this is one of my greatest friends, who's inclined to side with me by default, but the immediacy of that synthesis nudged me further to the above thoughts.\n\nIt is an interesting situation. If the scrolls were a full free mint, then I would have no qualms continuing with my ideas. If the money was directed to a public good or into a multisig, this might work as well.\n\nYet another concept I think is underexplored would be to have mints requiring ETH, which avoids single individuals minting too many, but simply lock that ETH for a time rather than take it for yourself as the dev. Could even convert it as rETH during the lock (or require rETH straight). Use the yield for *something*, or give it back to the user in full once the time is up. Plenty of inventive ways to build permissionless gates. Although, of course, this doesn't come without attack vectors; i.e., someone with capital confident the contract will spit out the ETH back could just decide to lock up a lot of money to get much of the supply. There's no perfect solution, but there's different approaches to try and iterate upon if one is truly interested in getting something out for the people.\n\nAnyway, this is getting behind the point of this particular topic. If I try to step back from my emotions, the logical move is to wait and see. I should pause any involved plan of my own until I see either the collection minting out (which strikes me as unlikely, if the dev does nothing more than a basic mint site, but who knows?) *or* the dev putting a genuine effort to build value. It serves no point getting creative for free if I'm going to end up bitter about it.\n\nAdmittedly, one could make the argument the collection may very well stall precisely because I hold so much of the supply. But then, this doesn't change my (lack of) incentive here. Putting effort into doing creative stuff for free can already suck when someone else reaps the credit for it. It might feel even worse if you're building someone's else equity in the process!\n\nNow I do have one idea to somewhat align the incentives regardless. I'm planning my own dapp for Scroll. It will be bespoke, unique and never done before, so I don't want to spoil it too much; but there will be daily voting mechanics, and I figure the top contributor/voter each day could be sent a spell as a reward. That could be a fun little extra. The dapp is nowhere near ready, which gives even more weight to the wait-and-see approach for spellscrolls.\n\nThanks for reading my blogpost.
