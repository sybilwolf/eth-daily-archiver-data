This information was then quickly picked up by Benzinga newswire and subsequently by Reuters, one of the world's most trusted news agencies.

Mankind has colonized the milky way galaxy. Every digital interaction, no matter what it is, settles to the Ethereum blockchain in some way or another. One Ethereum L1 transaction costs $20M ($50k inflation-adjusted), and they are used solely for mega-zk-validium settlement and the occasional reconciliation of splits and merges between stellar meta-governance systems.\n\nEach one of such systems maintains redundant data receivers on not just multiple planets, but multiple local star systems. This is to prevent another catastrophe like happened in the Crov MDK6 system in 2956, where a solar flare event caused downtime in their receivers, leading them to miss 10 seconds of inbound blockchain data. Because the nearest mirror of the data was over 20 standard days away, even via state-of-the-art FTL communications, Crov MDK6 became desynced from the intra-galactic settlement system (IGSS) for over 40 days while they waited for a round-trip transmission to retrieve the lost data needed to reconstruct the ledger.\n\nThinking quick on his feet, the sitting president of Crov MDK6 came up with a clever plan, which he implemented by using the State Of Emergency Act of 2631: the Crov government would reconstruct those 10 seconds of ledger as best as they could, based on the public mempool. Then, they would maintain a permissioned fork of the IGSS until the canonical data was received. Finally, they would rebase their own fork on top of the IGSS, replaying as many as possible of their local transactions into the IGSS in an orderly way - the blockchain equivalent of `git --rebase`.\n\nThe plan turned out to be a partial success. The local IGSS fork was created, and it functioned well during the 40 days of disconnect. The problem came when Crov MDK6 finally received the canonical data. A dictator had been in the process of being overthrown in Grars 8052, a far-flung solar system in the Orion-Cygnus arm of the galaxy, and during Crov\u2019s ten second outage, Grars had published a Standard Transmission Of Pause (STOP) to halt economic settlement of their own validium within the IGSS during the governmental transfer of power. The incumbent dictator, of course, ignored this STOP and continued broadcasting transactions as if he had never been overthrown.\n\nThe first messages posted by this dictator were the financial equivalent of an SOS - a monumental bounty for his own safe extraction from the Grars 8052 sector. Because Crov MDK6 had not received the STOP message due to the outage, they incorrectly assumed that the dictator\u2019s bounty was valid on-chain, thus the Crov MDK6 financial district placed large investments in contracts for the dictator\u2019s extraction by galactic bounty hunters local to Grars 8052. These contracts had already been sent over the FTL system, were 40 days into their 90 day delivery time, and could not be rescinded.\n\nIn the ensuing financial mess, Crov MDK6\u2019s private sector had paid a handsome sum to the bounty hunters, while they had themselves expected to be reimbursed by the Grars 8052 dictator\u2019s (invalid) contract. Due to the exceedingly low probability of a STOP message being sent during the outage (typically STOP messages are only broadcast every few hundred years), Crov MDK6\u2019s private sector had ignored this tail-event risk, oversizing their investments to profit from the Grars dictator\u2019s generous (but ultimately invalid) contract. This left Crov\u2019s financial markets in debt and in ruin, leading to the Great Crov Depression of the early 3000s, eventually resulting in the Democratic Party Of Socialism taking the Crov presidency for the first time in over 700 years of running against the incumbent Democratic Party Of Free Markets. This had all sorts of positive and negative ramifications for the population of Crov MDK6, and ended up setting the star system on a completely different historical trajectory than if they hadn\u2019t had a 10 second outage in their data receivers.
