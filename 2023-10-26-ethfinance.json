It explains what Eurodollars are (a concept I had no idea existed), how the US dealt with it in the past and how something similar might happen with stablecoins. \n\nIn the end the episode is a bull case for stablecoins (which is interestingly also the title on the bankless homepage) and I think it is a pretty good one. Nic shares that he/they have made a lot of investments in stablecoins and while he doesn't know *when* they will take off, he believes that will happen. \n\n\\+++\n\n[**0xResearch: How Wallets Are MEV Sleeping Giants feat. Matt Cutler**](https://blockworks.co/podcast/0xresearch/2043acba-6f71-11ee-a0b3-6b69cc8fd982)\n\nI love MEV, Matt Cutler is a great guest and 0xResearch is a pretty good podcast, because it's on topic, no bullshit = great episode for me. The episode is about the MEV landscape, what has happened since the merge and the importance of private order flow. They also touch MEV burn and why it is very complicated. \n\nIf you have one hour and are interested in MEV and the current setup this one is a perfect summary. He also explains the importance of relays (min 25 following), today and in the future (spoiler: we might not be able to eliminate them, even in the long run). \n\n\\+++\n\n[**Bell Curve: The Rise of Crypto's Superapp feat Fiskantes and Matti from Zee Prime Capital**](https://blockworks.co/podcast/bellcurve/42d3b66c-7228-11ee-a315-437f3d1c580d)\n\nYou might know Fiskantes and / or Matti from twitter. Both are part of Zee Prime Capital and share they thoughts/ insights from this ~~bear~~ builder market. They don't hold back, criticize development (\"dev 2 dev\") and investments these days, explain what and why they want to see when it comes to investments. They basically also say that Cosmos is dead. \n\nI just like their approach, again no bullshit, they say what they think and the conversation seems to be pretty unfiltered (at least to me). \n\nHonorary mentions in the context for the Bell Curve Season 6 around DEXes. There are some pretty good episodes, but they are (imo) fairly technical and it's hard for me to follow sometimes. Still this is great content as well, so if you're interested in DEXes and research around it (\"LVR\", \"intents\", etc.) the episodes are great!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's see if I can publish the next one in November.
