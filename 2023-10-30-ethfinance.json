It was originally deployed on the Rinkeby testnet which is deprecated now. I never found the time to redeploy on a newer network. That is what I did in the last few days.\n\nIt is a [warrant canary contract]([Warrant canary - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary)). In simple terms, you can put a statement with an expiry date on chain and sign it with you key. You can renew the expiry date as often as you want. Once it is expired everyone will assume the statement is not true anymore. The contract has an additional twist: you can assign a third party address and enclose funds. Once your warrant canary has expired the third party can claim these funds. You, as the owner of a specific warrant canary can always change the third party and/or claim these funds from the contract. More explanations [are on the github site.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary)\n\nYou can interact with the contract on scroll testnet: https://warrantcanary-testnet.haurog.xyz/\n\nOr on the scroll mainnet: https://warrantcanary-scroll-mainnet.haurog.xyz/\n\nThe smart contract addresses are here for the [scroll testnet](https://sepolia.scrollscan.com/address/0xdefd37cfe93f8b50ec4332bdacdaf4eadfc78be3) and [scroll mainnet](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xdefd37cfe93f8b50ec4332bdacdaf4eadfc78be3).\n\nThe UI is very minimal. It was my first time actually coding a website. It does the job, but not much more.\n\nYou can connect via metamask (or frame or rabbit) and list all the warrant canaries deployed or only the ones which are associated with your address.\n\nTo create a new warrant canary add an expiration time (in [unix epoch](https://www.epochconverter.com/)) and a purpose and create it. The third party and funds to enclose are optional and I suggest you not to enclose funds on Scroll mainnet as this contract has not been audited. If you want to enclose funds, do it on the testnet.\n\nGenerally, it was quite easy to deploy the smart contract on Scroll. Verification of the contract was a bit a hassle as the only explanations I found were for the scroll [blockscout explorer](https://blockscout.scroll.io) but not https://scrollscan.com. So I had to upload the file manually for verification. What took me the most time was the website. I had to adapt the wallet interaction to work with scroll. Scroll does not have eip1559 transactions. which lead to my wallet library (web3.js) to bug out, so I had to manually force legacy transactions. This then lead to the data field of the transaction being empty and I had to re-add it manually. No one should use raw web3.js for wallet interaction anymore as there are good wrappers around these low level libraries nowadays. So this is probably a problem not many people will have when developing for scroll.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>After <a href=\"/r/SwagtimusPrime\">r/SwagtimusPrime</a> announced that we [get an NFT to deploy on scroll](<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17gov0s/daily_general_discussion_october_26_2023/k6jbva8/\">SwagtimusPrime comments on Daily General Discussion - October 26, 2023</a>) I dug out my first smart contract I wrote for a coding bootcamp.

They taste great! They'll make you a cool party person! They'll quench your thrist!\n\nThey narrow the focus on only a small part of what makes a drink important (taste), then weave a narrative around the more qualitative aspects (even if water is better at that too).\n\nThe same plays out with Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum's vision of decentralization started with credible neutrality. The first ethers were sold to anyone who wanted in. Then, anyone could mine ethers with their hardware. \n\nEthereum has no CEO, no company spearheading development, no privileged actor with an enshrined right. This is key, solving the \"decentralization\" part of the trilemma must include these properties. \n\nSoft drink sellers would like you to believe a sugary taste will quench your thrist best. Solana sellers would like you to believe decentralization is strictly a question of running a few thousand nodes in data centers (and even in this narrowed focus, much like water, Ethereum is better: anyone can stake from home and there are hundreds of thousands of nodes).\n\nEthereum is the superior blockchain because it is the world computer, a platform for everyone. \n\nThis makes it more resilient now: Solana has outages, Ethereum doesn't.\n\nThis makes it more resilient in the near future: it would be easier for governments to shut down Solana than Ethereum.\n\nThis makes it more resilient in the far future: people want to build the network as equals, not as second class citizens to enrich a private company and their investors. Ethereum attracts speculators and idealists, while Solana only attracts speculators.\n\nIn short, the quality of a blockchain is more than a couple indicators like transaction cost or transactions per second. Other metrics can include: enshrined privileged actors, existence of corporate structure, initial coin distribution, ongoing coin distribution, required hardware for nodes, geographic distribution of nodes, uptime...\n\nA problem that worries some Ethereum fans these days is composability. With the rollup approach to scaling, liquidity can be fragmented between different islands.\n\nThere are micro counterpoints to be made against this worry.

They taste great! They&#39;ll make you a cool party person! They&#39;ll quench your thrist!</p>\n\n<p>They narrow the focus on only a small part of what makes a drink important (taste), then weave a narrative around the more qualitative aspects (even if water is better at that too).</p>\n\n<p>The same plays out with Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum&#39;s vision of decentralization started with credible neutrality. The first ethers were sold to anyone who wanted in. Then, anyone could mine ethers with their hardware. </p>\n\n<p>Ethereum has no CEO, no company spearheading development, no privileged actor with an enshrined right. This is key, solving the &quot;decentralization&quot; part of the trilemma must include these properties. </p>\n\n<p>Soft drink sellers would like you to believe a sugary taste will quench your thrist best. Solana sellers would like you to believe decentralization is strictly a question of running a few thousand nodes in data centers (and even in this narrowed focus, much like water, Ethereum is better: anyone can stake from home and there are hundreds of thousands of nodes).</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum is the superior blockchain because it is the world computer, a platform for everyone. </p>\n\n<p>This makes it more resilient now: Solana has outages, Ethereum doesn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>This makes it more resilient in the near future: it would be easier for governments to shut down Solana than Ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>This makes it more resilient in the far future: people want to build the network as equals, not as second class citizens to enrich a private company and their investors.
