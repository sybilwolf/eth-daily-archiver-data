There are some validators waiting, but we are not remotely close to the numbers we witnessed some months ago. Even more interesting is the exit queue and number of validators that left. More than 21000 validators exited in October or they are waiting to exit.. That the biggest change we have seen so far. Why? Could be an reaction to Lido, see Pool distribution later. \n\n  \n**Client diversity numbers\\*\\***  \n***Consensus***\n\n* Prysm 43% (October: 46%, May: 38%)\n* Lighthouse 34% (October: 33%, May: 37%)\n* Teku 17% (October: 14%, May: 17%)\n* Nimbus 5% (October: 5%, May: 6%)\n* Lodestar 1% (October: 1%, May: 1%)\n\n  \n***Execution***\n\n* Geth 86% (October: 84%)\n* Nethermind 7% (October: 7%)\n* Erigon 2% (October: 2%)\n* Besu 5% (October: 5%)\n\nClient diversity is a mixed bag. Consensus looks better, with Prysm losing market share and Teku and Lighthose gaining a little. Overall I think this is a pretty good and healthy setup! \n\nExecution is different though. Geth's numbers are up (estimated), from 84% to 86%. That's obviously not too good. But let me tell you a story: I made the switch from Geth to Nethermind one month ago. No proposals, no sync committees. My validator is running **very** stable now and is in the top 7,5% of all validators. So the switch is good for client diversity, but might also improve your setup and a gwei here and there because of a better performance (opt. incl. distance, less missed attestations etc.).\n\n  \n**Pool distribution\\*\\*\\***\n\n* Lido 31,4% (October: 32,3%)\n* Coinbase 13,7% (October: 8,1%)\n* Binance 4,5% (October: 4,2%)\n* Kraken 2,9% (October: 3,0%)\n* Rocket Pool 2,9% (October: 3,0%)\n* \\+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc.\n\n  \nPool distribution is still a concern for a lot of people, but things are moving into a better direction. Right now Lido is down when it comes to market share. They have still added more validators, but Lido is growing slower than the network. That is good news. Maybe those vampire attacks are a good thing after all... \n\nSo let's talk about the Coinbase change: This is not growth, but a change in data. I think a bunch of validators were tagged to be Coinbase in the past weeks, so this change is a correction. Obviously 13% is a lot, but Coinbase is still far away from critical milestones (22% or even 33%). Did Coinbase self limit? I somehow think they did, but I am not 100% sure.  \n\n  \nAll percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.  \n\\* https://beaconcha.in/validators#all  \n\\*\\* https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution  \n\\*\\*\\* https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Here&#39;s the seventh edition of the monthly staking update</strong><br/>\nThe Monthly Staking Update is back with good news and bad news. #lido As always I&#39;ll summarize numbers and share my thoughts but I am also looking forward to your comments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Validator overview - total: 998100 validators\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>870084 active (October: 840554; +29530 / +3,5%, | May: 554322; +315762 / +56,9%)</li>\n<li>1024 pending (October: 9685; -8663 / -89,4% | May: 15537; -14513 / -93,4%)</li>\n<li>722 exiting (October: 0; 0 / +700% | May: 7333; -6611 / -90%)</li>\n<li>126166 exited (October: 105145; +21021 / +20% | May: 39341; +86825 / +220%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If we look at the numbers from October there&#39;s (in my opinion) two changes that very interesting: The network is still growing, but the entry queue is rather low.

It was already [mentioned here yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17keaci/daily_general_discussion_october_31_2023/k7aa5ht/) by u/gwenvador. Walletconnect has become a fundamental infrastructure in our space because it is a good product. It enables us to connect non browser based wallets to dApps. \nA few months ago they introduced walletconnect v2. Now, every dApp needs an unique API key to be able to integrate walletconnect. Every developer needs to register and fill in a form and then add the API key to their dApp. What this means is now walletconnect can pretty much prevent individual dApps from using their infrastructure at any time. They now following OFAC sanctions should be a stark warning of this centralisation issue.\n\n~~In my understanding, the problem is even worse: if a dApp developer uses [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) for wallet interaction, any wallet connection relies on walletconnect. So even connecting connecting through metamask somehow seems to connect to a walletconnect rpc. If they block your dApp your SOL.\nTo the best of my knowledge the [Blocknative wallet SDK](https://www.blocknative.com/wallets) handles this better and at least the metamask (and similar wallets) are handled separately from walletconnect. I have only used RainbowKit in my projects but will move over to blocknative to see if it is better.~~ -> see the more nuanced edit below.\n\nAll in all I see walletconnect as a very dangerous centralisation vector in our space were a single entity can switch off access to dApps. The 'd' in dApps looses all meaning . A user has no way to interact with a dApp once they revoke an API key. At least with infura a user can just switch to a non tracking non censoring RPC provider, but walletconnect is much deeper intertwined in our space. Unfortunately, I do not see an alternative at the moment, but we desperately need one. \n\nThere was a short mention and discussion of [this issue by ligi](https://nitter.net/mr_ligi/status/1719490991932018937#m).\n\nEdit: I ran some tests with the RainbowKit sdk on [my own dApp](https://reth-skimmer.haurog.xyz/). I first disallowed all network connections outside of the website itself and step by step allowed one after the other to see what is still broken and what starts working. I used [requestblock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestblock/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) to do this.\n\nThe following connections are invoked: \n\nhttps://cloudflare-eth.com  -> rpc provider\n\nhttp://walletlink.org  -> to connect to coinbase wallet, uses ankr as rpc provider\n\nwss://relay.walletconnect.org\n\nwss://relay.walletconnect.com\n\nhttp://verify.walletconnect.com\n\nhttp://explorer-api.walletconnect.com\n\nIf I block all of them, I can connect my browser wallet, Coinbase wallet but nothing works.

DAOs nullify all of these issues. In fact, DAOs don\u2019t even need multisigs if the treasury is set up in a smart contract controlled by clever governance mechanisms (a la Colony, DaoHaus, or Hats to name a few). \n2.
