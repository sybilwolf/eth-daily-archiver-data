of you may remember that a few days ago [I asked about documenting my non-custodial crypto to get pre-approved for a new home loan](https://www.reddit.com/user/pr0nh0li0/). I got a variety of answers and suggestions, including some that said income was more important and the crypto wouldn't make a difference.\n\nAfter some back and forth with the lender, just thought I'd follow up to let you know we were told that the crypto would make a difference \"for the maximum sales price\" of the home. And that we could document it the following way:\n\n1. Document ownership of funds.  Please provide documentation that funds deposited into your crypto address came from your accounts. \n2. Document that the secure signature is under your control. (i.e. sign a message from the address)\n\nFor what it's worth, we were told we could also avoid steps 1 and 2 if we sell to USD and put it in our bank accounts for 2 months/2 bank statements so that it is \"seasoned.\" Because putting together the address history with airdrops is going to be a huge pain in the ass, that's what we may end up doing in the long run (especially since we have not gotten close to finding the right house yet). But with my lender/underwriter, it is at least possible to self custody and have those assets counted toward your overall loan value. It will absolutely vary from lender to lender of course, but we are very pleased with what we've heard from ours.

I got a variety of answers and suggestions, including some that said income was more important and the crypto wouldn&#39;t make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>After some back and forth with the lender, just thought I&#39;d follow up to let you know we were told that the crypto would make a difference &quot;for the maximum sales price&quot; of the home. And that we could document it the following way:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Document ownership of funds.  Please provide documentation that funds deposited into your crypto address came from your accounts. </li>\n<li>Document that the secure signature is under your control. (i.e. sign a message from the address)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For what it&#39;s worth, we were told we could also avoid steps 1 and 2 if we sell to USD and put it in our bank accounts for 2 months/2 bank statements so that it is &quot;seasoned.&quot; Because putting together the address history with airdrops is going to be a huge pain in the ass, that&#39;s what we may end up doing in the long run (especially since we have not gotten close to finding the right house yet).

Naturally, being from the US I had to get a special VPN and lie on on their website to even enlist in the airdrop. Given that they blocked normal VPNs like Mullvad that alone took a few hours to figure out.\n\nThen I get the TIA. At first it could only be traded with Kucoin, but they blocked US customers and requested I KYC before they'd allow my old account to trade, so I abandoned that side. I didn't want to make a new Kraken or MexC account because my tax accountant already wants to fire me and it's just one more 2FA code I'd need to manage, etc. So that left me without a viable CEX to just sell TIA and withdraw to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nI'd heard that Osmosis was the Cosmos ecosystem Dex so I did what a lot of people did and IBC bridged my TIA to Osmosis. First, that failed like 3-4 times over several hours and kept sending my funds back to me like 20 minutes after I initiated the bridge. Better than keeping my money, but not a great sign for the scalability of the Osmosis chain. Next obviously was a gas problem. Celestia didn't have a Dex I could swap to OSMO and bridge that and I didn't just have some random OSMO tokens sitting around and there's no account abstraction or shapeshift or something I could use to bridge + swap without having some bootstrap gas. So what do? The good news was Coinbase had OSMO listed. The bad news is Coinbase is I obviously have whitelisting enabled from my Coinbase account as a security measure. So I added my Osmosis address to the whitelist as a precautionary measure, but I didn't want to wait 48 hours to sell if I could help it. Thankfully, a kind ethfinancier (Sourdoughpretzel4444) spotted me enough gas to get started (my community rocks).\n\nSo, now I'm empowered to do some trades. I immediately trade some TIA for OSMO and return the gas + a few extra for helping me out and then I go to trade the TIA for some kind of USDC I can bridge off chain. \"Unknown error encountered\" when Keplr tries to send the transaction to my Ledger. Like what? I just did a trade of TIA to OSMO to repay the gas. Try a different USDC, same error. Try smaller amounts in case it's slippage (there is a conspicuous absence of a slippage toleration parameter on the UI), same error. Huh, ok, well if trading to OSMO is all I can do, let's do that. Transaction failed. Ok, now *thats* probably a slippage problem. Trade half, transaction failed. Trade 10%, transaction successful. Trade 10% 9 more times, now I have a pile of OSMO.\n\nSigh. OK, figure out the deposit of OSMO to Coinbase (weird memo system), trade the OSMO to USD, convert to USDC, withdraw to Ethereum. Holy shit, what a piece of crap ecosystem.

It started with [this bankless episode](https://www.bankless.com/170-drake-dom) feat. Justin Drake and u/domotheus. \n\nBack then Justin Drake basically referenced \"Homo economicus\" to explain his thoughts on staking, MEV, MEV burn and I think also decentralization.  I understand *why* he did that (also because of the discussion we had back then, which I sadly can't find right now), but I am not sure I necessarily agree(d) with his takes.

There are of course a lot of differences (no setup cost for LSTs vs setup cost for hardware for solo stakers, x% fee for LST pool vs cost to run the validator = mostly electricity, nearly 0 maintenance cost vs maintenance for validator etc.), but I think even though LSTs might have a better / smooth APR, that is not really crucial. People will not make a decision only based on APR, the other differences play a similar or maybe sometimes even bigger role in my opinion. \n\nThis opinion is based on my own experience and anecdotal evidence from this sub, twitter etc. Of course (!) I can't speak for all potential (solo) stakers out there. But I think it is at least fair to question that APR is the most important factor. \n\nAPR is of course important! Financial incentives are central when it comes to blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Yes, I also want to be rewarded for my services/ securing the ecosystem! But it's not everything. Or in other words: If it was about APR only there wouldn't be any solo stakers. \n\nBut why are there solo stakers? \n\n>Solo stakers are not economically rational. We are a different breed. We are ideological rational, our reward is a censorship resistant, decentralised network.\n\nInterestingly that is also the conclusion from [Jon Charb](https://twitter.com/jon_charb) in the Lightspeed postcast \"[Solana vs Ethereum: Two Paths, One Endgame](https://blockworks.co/podcast/lightspeed/c4a8ce48-7219-11ee-8983-eb0e07f62029)\" (and I just listened to it yesterday, so I didn't know about his thoughts last week). \n\nI think we do this because we believe it is morally right. There is a emotional reward. Not all rewards can be (perfectly) measured or given a USD value. But I also really really liked Phiz [following tweet](https://x.com/superphiz/status/1718256336696119470?s=20):\n\n>Staking on Ethereum from home might make you rich.   \nNot because of the APY, but because you'll contribute to a decentralized future for humanity that \\_might\\_ also increase the value of Ether and line your pockets.\n\nThis basically sums it up perfectly in my opinion. There are measurable direct rewards. But there are also potential indirect financial rewards that can't be predicted but will only be real if we invest (time, money, energy) to give them a chance to materialize. \n\nAre we purely in it for the tech? I am not. But I believe that the tech needs decentralization to make it to 100k/ ETH. \n\nInterestingly I think a lot of solo stakers are also validating because they want to participate in the MEV lottery. Is that rational? It is not, we basically know for every USD we will only receive 50cents back, burning 50cents (which is revenue for lottery companies). We still do it. Well, because we are NOT Homo Economicus. \n\nThis is why I also think that burning MEV might hurt decentralization... Instead of leveling the playing field by giving all stakers the same APR, it might actually hurt motivation to solo stake, leading to centralization. \n\nI believe we need to make staking easier, eliminate (technical) entry barriers. *That* will really have an impact on solo staker participation. It is fucking scary to solo stake. APR doesn't matter when it comes to deciding for or against solo staking.
