After step 4 instead of converting to Osmo which is lesser known token and is less supported by exchanges. You can convert it to ATOM, which is much more widely supported. So it goes like.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Swap TIA to ATOM.</li>\n<li>Go to Assets Page in the app.</li>\n<li>Click on Withdraw button for ATOM. Kepler will prompt to withdraw the ATOM in the your Osmosis chain address to ATOM in the your Cosmos hub chain address.</li>\n<li>Now you can deposit your ATOM to your exchange and convert it to ETH there.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I personally used Path 2, a couple days back.  Let me know if you face any issues or if there is any better paths. There are many ways you can do this. Many bridges, exchanges etc. As the saying goes-</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ALL PATHS LEAD TO ETHEREUM.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!. :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-03 08:47:26","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-11-03 10:08:40","id":"k7nxhdr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17moc9h","parent_id":"t3_17moc9h","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptomoon2020","body":"I don't see why so many people are making this complex.\n\nSend directly to kraken and sell.
