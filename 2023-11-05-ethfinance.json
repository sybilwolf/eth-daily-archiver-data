This scheme mandates all large businesses excluding the agricultural sector* must obtain and then surrender NZUs to the government for every ton of carbon emissions. Currently, the government auctions off a set amount of NZUs regularly based on NZ's long term emissions reduction goals as per international agreements. This auctioned off supply is constantly shrinking and we all know what a shrinking supply can do to price.

My initial hesitation is that at the end of the day, at least with NZU\u2019s the government can step in to increase supply is speculators take over the market and impede a nation\u2019s economy. On the other hand, if this idea has legs, a small yet progressive country like New Zealand would be the place to start. Our carbon market is small enough that meme driven speculation could impact the price and our reputation as a green and progressive country would be on the line if there was government intervention to alleviate any carbon squeezes. I realise that this is mostly a pie in the sky idea, I still find it an interesting thought and it would be cool to see a CarbonRepricingDAO spin up and give it a shot.\n\nRegardless of what you think, it seems like this is an interesting investment opportunity at current carbon prices to front-run the ever increasing cost of climate change.
