Honestly zksync sucks - expensive and has compatibility issues - it\u2019s getting used because people are heavily farming the chain that from the beginning has said they will have a token. No reason otherwise to use a rollup still in alpha (unless you really want a zkApe). Rollups are a potential goldmine for VCs with their governance tokens so they\u2019ll keep getting spun up - it\u2019ll get worse before it gets better - endless new rollups promising some great new innovation when in reality they\u2019re just iterating off of what other people have done just to push out a new token and keep 40% of it. In reality a handful of general purpose rollups with substantial liquidity is all we need - eg arb op and maybe a zk chain or two (just to figure out which design is most effective long term). And on the fringes actual experimentation with truly new design concepts - like the SVM rollup idea. But nah it\u2019s gonna be like \u201cEth killers\u201d only \u201cArb killers\u201d over the next few years, and probably will not be positive for ETH ecosystem.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-08 06:26:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k8cytxi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17qf8oj","parent_id":"t1_k8cc1uq","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/mathfanEM","body":"the recent L2 work from =nil; foundation seems to be aimed at addressing this","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>the recent L2 work from =nil; foundation seems to be aimed at addressing this</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-08 05:12:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k8cozg1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17qf8oj","parent_id":"t1_k8cc1uq","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"In theory they can cooperate directly, but they are too nascent.

The world\u2019s first blockDAG \u2013 a digital ledger enabling parallel blocks and instant transaction confirmation \u2013 built on a robust proof-of-work engine with rapidsingle-second block intervals.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>TECHNICALLY SPEAKING</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency which implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG does not orphan blocks created in parallel, but rather allows them to coexist and orders them in consensus. Whereby Kaspa is actually a blockDAG; you can see GHOSTDAG in action in a real time blockDAG visualizer.  </p>\n\n<p>This generalization of Nakamoto consensus allows for secure operation while maintaining very high block rates (currently one block per second, aiming for 32/sec, with visions of 100/sec) and minuscule confirmation times dominated by internet latency (cf. chapter 6 of the research paper for some initial benchmarks).  </p>\n\n<p>The Kaspa implementation includes a lot of cool features and subprotocols including Reachability to query the DAG\u2019s topology, Block data pruning (with near-future plans for block header pruning), SPV proofs, and later subnetwork support which will make future implementation of layer 2 solutions much easier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-08 15:49:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k8fifrl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17qf8oj","parent_id":"t1_k8fgx08","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-08 16:09:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k8flfhf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17qf8oj","parent_id":"t1_k8fifrl","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/kenzi28","body":"But do they have a collaboration with McDs with the founders taking a selfie having big macs?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>But do they have a collaboration with McDs with the founders taking a selfie having big macs?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-08 18:44:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k8g85wk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17qf8oj","parent_id":"t1_k8flfhf","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-08 18:55:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k8g9qs0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17qf8oj","parent_id":"t1_k8g85wk","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/kenzi28","body":"Surely you don't need me to spell out the nightmare of my (our) dreams. \n\nO\n\nM\n\nG","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Surely you don&#39;t need me to spell out the nightmare of my (our) dreams. </p>\n\n<p>O</p>\n\n<p>M</p>\n\n<p>G</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-08 19:20:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k8gd61x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17qf8oj","parent_id":"t1_k8g9qs0","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"Nope, but just had a quick look.
