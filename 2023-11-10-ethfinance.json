I'm at Staking Summit to start off my week (and change) of Devconnect fun times. I'm not going to give as detailed a daily summary as I've done for ETHDenver, but hope to give a little insight into what's happening.\n\nDevconnect is a collection of independent events organized in the same week and in the same city. There's going to be a general coworking space opening up on Monday and available through the week, but most actual events are only 1-2 days long. Staking Summit is getting started a little \"early\", but seems to have gotten decent attendance.\n\nStaking Summit has one stage with a series of talks and panels, a breakout area for occasional workshops, a lot of room for projects to set up booths, and a pretty nice spread of snacks. The event is advertised as being about PoS and staking in general, not just about ETH. I get the impression that some attendees are interested in staking as a financial vehicle, just as a place you can put capital to earn yield without caring too much about what it means. But not too much of that. Saw a lot of familiar faces already, met new folks too.\n\nMost talks were kinda simple. A few things of note:\n\n* A panel of investors talked about what they're looking for when investing in a staking company; a few of their comments: Any good idea can be copied, looking for ability to attract liquidity. Value of staking is ultimately supported by the crypto ecosystem behind the asset, looking for companies aligned with that. DVT and restaking provide additional investor optionality, but for restaking have to consider how much additional leverage they're building into the system. Institutions are still talking about Bitcoin, hopefully there's a growing awareness of ETH as an asset, and later the full range of staking offerings.\n* Michael Hua, researcher at 1kx, thinks that the LST market will continue to get more competitive, and Lido's dominance may naturally dwindle. 1) Novel infrastructure offerings: Kiln, Stakewise v3, NodeSet, and better DeFi composability. 2) General market forces: Lido is not the best fit for institutions (e.g. KYL/AML) and we could see verticalization from frontends (e.g. wallets and exchanges making their own LSTs). 3) Unique token designs: protocol value accrual, vampire attacks, etc.\n* Fisher Yu, Founder and CTO of BabylonChain talked about their system for \"staking BTC\". They imply that their system allows for trustless deposits, \"restaking\", and slashing. I don't know much else about it: if it works, if there are major caveats, how you can define slashing conditions on the Bitcoin blockchain, etc.\n* Eugene Pshenichny, Protocol Dev at Lido, discussed their plans for the future of Lido. Staking router (for permissionless NOs) and dual governance (to give stETH holders some power) were things I was already pretty familiar with. They're looking to make use of EIPs 4788, 7002, and 7521 as they become available. Actually *not* particularly bullish on restaking. Considering a form of semi-ossification in which Lido contracts could only be modified at the same time as ETH hard forks. Thinking about a way to let validators move their stake between LSTs without having to exit and re-enter (would require an EIP).\n\n(Posted this an hour ago, looks like it got deleted somehow?

To summarise it is not really clear if these settings improve anything outside of improving the time sync chart. Quite a few people did it, but did not see tangible improvements outside of the chart improving.<br/>\nThe argument goes like this: If your time is really off it definitely helps. If you are in good sync already, but everyone around you is off, further improving the timesync does not really help you as the ones around you are the problem.<br/>\nIn my understanding the default ubuntu time sync is already quite ok, but if you want to nerd out, use the coincashew guide they apparently improve the chart the most.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-10 03:34:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k8mt90w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17rxlo5","parent_id":"t1_k8ml8jc","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/maninthecryptosuit","body":"If I'm using chronyd and missing like 1 attestation a week, do you think it is worth doing this?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If I&#39;m using chronyd and missing like 1 attestation a week, do you think it is worth doing this?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-10 08:07:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k8nsv9j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17rxlo5","parent_id":"t1_k8mt90w","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"My very personal opinion, missing one attestation per week is pretty close to perfect.

(When you sign a tx in metamask it gets sent to an ethereum node which broadcasts it through the network and nodes include it in their local storage of pending transactions = the &quot;mempool&quot; - but there isn&#39;t infinite space for storing such pending tx so after a while if the tx doesn&#39;t get included nodes will start dropping the tx from the mempool. This means that even if the gas price drops below the fee price of the tx it might not be included in a block because the nodes of the network &quot;forgot&quot; it exists...)</p>\n\n<p>If you sign a tx and you can&#39;t see it in etherscan it might be that it got dropped because the node already has a tx with higher gas fee for the same nonce... or something is wrong with the software broadcasting the tx, the node it tries to send the tx to or the ethereum network itself (unlikely)...</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I can&#39;t tell where the root of your problem lies at the moment.
