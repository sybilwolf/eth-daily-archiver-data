I thought it was a nice event.\n\nThe space has evolved over the years. PoS, the beacon chain, the merge, withdrawals: they're all old news. ETH staking has matured significantly and now the big questions revolve around the businesses that provide staking as a service. Do you run validators yourself or outsource it, and then to who? Do you provide an LST? Do you focus on making a user-friendly frontend that supports multiple chains? How do you interact with Lido, SSV Network, and other platforms that could deliver you some liquidity?\n\nSeems like you're either a professional node operator running a business, or a naive end-user with funds that they want to give to someone to invest on their behalf. As someone who's very content to solo stake, there's not a ton of content really tailored to me (maybe solo staking is just \"solved\" in a sense?). I think you could argue that running Rocket Pool minipools makes me not so different from the SaaS providers: I'm running validators that use funds provided by other people, and I'm partially responsible for their yield. But I still feel like there's a gap there.\n\nThe big topics on the tech side are DVT and restaking. The leading DVT implementations are looking to be fully operational and permissionless by Q1 2024. Restaking is the big thing further out on the horizon that everyone is watching to see how it plays out.\n\n----------------\n\nAnyway, a few specific notes:\n\n* Attended a Diva workshop where they had people run their software on a cheap Digital Ocean droplet, connect to a synced Goerli node they provided for the event, and basically be ready to start running validators. The process wasn't perfect: we were basically beta testing their software and documentation and encountered a number of (mainly UX) issues. But I got it working in the end. If enough goeth finds its way into the deposit pool there's a chance my little Diva node could be assigned a 1/16 share of a Goerli validator.\n* Puffer was an interesting staking platform in development I had never heard of. My understanding from talking to the team was that they're trying to build it with EigenLayer in mind, using permissionless 2-ETH bond NO's for Ethereum validation duties, and a permissioned set of operators to specifically run the additional EigenLayer AVS's. Also mentioned potentially having NO's pay a year's worth of expected pool profits *upfront*, then the NO's keep all CL and EL rewards for that year. No splitter contract needed, any issues with NO performance come out of the NO's pocket, and no danger of MEV theft.\n* Attended a workshop by a DVT platform called SafeStake. I'd say it's most similar to ssv.network, but pretty early on in development (no DKG yet) and I don't see any particular feature or competitive edge they have to stand out. Dappnode demonstrated running SafeStake through their UI, and I definitely feel like the Dappnode software is looking pretty slick at this point.\n\nTomorrow's a quieter day. Doing a longer run, moving hotels to get closer to next week's events, and attending a Rocket Pool meetup. Then Devconnect proper begins Monday.\n\n[Not going to risk putting links in here after yesterday. @mods anything I can do to avoid getting comments auto-deleted when I try to link to the things I talk about?
