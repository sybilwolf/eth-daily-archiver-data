It's a two-day event, where they have booked two stages for two parallel tracks, and a space for booths. Also pretty solid food and drinks all day. It rained all day, glad yesterday was my \"see the city\" day.\n\nPOAP had a fun booth in which you proved ownership of a POAP to have a machine dispense a coin you could use for prizes. Not a zk proof of ownership like zkProofOfBuffiness from ETHDenver 2022, but still fun. Got to talk in nice technical detail with a Nimbus dev about what they need to do before relays can use Nimbus on their backend, and what relays can do to help with testnets. Also got the full rundown on Lido's Community Staking and Simple DVT Modules; most interesting comment was that RP+NodeSet and Lido+CSM are kind of convergent design on a similar permissioned/permissionless mix. Maybe :).\n\n* Mike Neuder of the EF gave a talk about the proposed MAX_EFFECTIVE BALANCE in EIP-7251. I think it's been generally covered here enough times for me to not have to explain it again. We're seeing a lot of staking products built on Ethereum now, and I have heard more concerns today about how this change carries a large cost in forcing them all to re-design their code. The change makes a lot of sense in a vacuum, but reality may provide some friction.\n* James Smith of the EF wants LST creators to stop trying to be too funky and focus on the basics. He sees that new staking pools are struggling to match the liquidity of big players, and are trying to compete by building in complexity. But the real problem is that none of them are really talking to their users. For example, 65% of stETH users don't do anything with it, it just sits in their wallet. So maybe you don't have to devote your whole team to making a cool token and working out a complicated system of DeFi incentives if you can just appeal to the right demographic. Mentioned Kiln's integration with Ledger, Coinbase converting their exchange user base into LST holders, and Frax as successful examples.\n* Alvaro R, Research Engineer at status.im, and Pol Lanski of Dappnode, announced the soft launch of their MEV smoothing pool for solo stakers (i.e. it's active but they haven't announced it everywhere yet). It's a similar design to the other smoothing pools I know. A few design choices of note: collateral is only 0.01 ETH, which works as anti-spam but does very little for MEV theft in exchange for easier user onboarding. Rewards are only paid out when you propose a block (not at all inbetween) which limits MEV theft but makes users wait. Transparency / fun fact: Aestus is an oracle operator for the similar project Smoothly, and may eventually receive a cut of their pool income intended only to cover oracle operation costs.\n* Kydo, Protocol Researcher at Eigenlayer, talked about censorship resistance before ePBS, specifically via MEV-Boost+. The problem is that proposers in MEV-Boost have to sell *all* their block space to a builder, many of which censor transactions. Instead, a validator could enroll in Eigenlayer and when they get a proposal they ask a relay for the Merkle root of the highest bid *partial block*. The proposer commits to that root, and the relay reveals the plaintext partial block. The proposer can then add any other transactions at the bottom of the block, something they can't do in current MEV-Boost. If they mess with the partial block at all, Eigenlayer slashes them. Good talk, well done.\n* Ken Smith of NextBlock (most might know him from Rocket Pool) explained the issue of MEV theft from staking pools. He ran some good data analysis based on Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter's MEV dataset to quantify the distribution of MEV and the effectiveness of potential attacks, most notably, waiting for a lottery block and stealing it rather than giving it to the pool. Possible solutions: relays could enforce fee recipients for validators in pools, pools with the RP model could take all CL rewards for the pool and give the NO all EL rewards, smoothing commitments where a proposer pays all expected fees upfront, and forced exits.\n* Marek Moraczy\u0144ski, Ethereum Core Developer at Nethermind, gave his perspective on client diversity. Nothing we don't know here on ethfinance. But emphasizing a few points. We need better data to assess EL client diversity. Diversity of nodes is better than diversity of validators which is better than diversity of other roles such as block builders.\n\nTomorrow is Staking Gathering day 2 and a MEV workshop in the evening.

I have plotted the monetary model which is the simplest of the three and the one that has no free parameters, so it's completely independent from any subjective input, against the daily close price of ETHUSD. Here are the results:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/dNTNzj6\n\nHow to understand the chart above:\n\nThe vertical red line is the merge, just so you can track when the models kick-in in full-force. The blue line is the daily market price of ETH in USD. The green line is the implied monetary price of that day, the orange line is the implied monetary price of the last 90 days (or roughly a quarter). The orange line is obviously lagging, but also smooths out the daily network activity. It's basically like judging a business by its quarterly data vs the activity on any single day which may be well above or below it.\n\nWhat's remarkable about the monetary price formula is that it's a very simple formula with no free-parameters that ties together 3, a priori, independent markets of ETH.\n\n- ETH token price market: The price as reflected in exchanges (i.e. Coinbase, Kraken, Uniswap...)\n\n- Blockspace market: The market for blockspace, what the world pays for inclusion in blocks.\n\n- ETH security market: The market for staking ETH, demand for staking ETH and therefore security budget of the network.\n\nThe three are related as follows: ETH Price [USD/ETH] = BaseFeesPaid [USD] / Issuance [ETH]\n\nThe monetary model tells you that these 3 markets cannot be fully uncorrelated, because there are interplays between the three. In fact, it can be shown that the network incentives cause a [stable equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory) around the monetary price. If you nudge slightly the price outside the monetary price it will tend to converge.\n\nAnother way to read the chart above is through the idea of monetary premium, which is why I called it the monetary price. We can distinguish 3 regimes:\n\n- When the actual price coincides with the monetary price, ETH has 0 monetary premium. That is, it's being acquired at the rate of its consumption by the EVM as a global settlement layer. \n\n- When the price is above, it's being acquired at rates above its consumption as a settlement layer. Therefore it's being hoarded as a store of value. \n\n- When the price is below, it's being acquired at rates below its usage as a settlement layer. ETH has negative monetary premium during those times.\n\nIf the Ethereum network succeeds we will see ETH acquire monetary premium and therefore the blue line will sit generously above the monetary price.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This post is slightly motivated by yesterday&#39;s submission by <a href=\"/u/Red_Corneas\">/u/Red_Corneas</a> : <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17tdxnc/daily_general_discussion_november_12_2023/k8x9xmf/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17tdxnc/daily_general_discussion_november_12_2023/k8x9xmf/</a></p>\n\n<p>Over a year has passed since the merge and close to 2 years since I posted here about how to value ETH under PoS: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum/</a></p>\n\n<p>So perhaps is time to reflect and have a look at the data.
