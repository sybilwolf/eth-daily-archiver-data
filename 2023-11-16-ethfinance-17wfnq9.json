This was scheduled to run for the full day, but it was the lower priority of my two events so I took off halfway through when the other started. They actually sold different tickets for the two different topics, billing them as separate events, but that wasn't really the case. The morning was more restaking focused, and I was more curious about MEV and intents, but oh well. In the afternoon I caught a bus to head over to Lidoconnect, which is exactly what it sounds like. Both events had the usual set of talks, socializing, and snacks.\n\n* The restaking content started off with Chunda McCain of Ion Protocol helping to contextualize restaking. Generally basic stuff, but may serve as a reminder for many of us. There are three stakeholders in a restaking system: node operators, middleware services, and restakers (the ones with the capital). Node operators are incentivized to scale as aggressively as possible and run all middleware that pays more than what their infrastructure costs, but there's a bit of a principal-agent problem that means that they'll do as little work as they can get away with. Middleware providers are the bottleneck to capital growth for the other two because they want to get security for cheap. Restakers are all about optimizing risk/reward.\n* Sebastian B\u00fcrgel of hopr described their new staking solution. I was previously familiar with hopr as an incentivized decentralized packet relay network (think Tor but with money involved). They're now working on a product called SafeStaking which splits staking operations into a Safe (mostly offline, secures assets and grants capabilities) and a Node (which does staking stuff when granted the ability by the Safe). And of course your access to the P2P traffic is made private with the hopr network.\n* Matt Shams and Vincent Ameida of Blockswap Labs tried to explain K2 Restaking Cloud. Honestly, it was overly technical and not well explained. There is, at the very least, a way for someone to sign up for this, commit to some sort of \"restaking\", and then there are Reporters who compute zk proofs of whether you did your job (in which case you get paid) or not (in which case you get \"slashed\" somehow).\n* Claudio Cossio of Meta Pool talked about their attempts to grow crypto in emerging markets. They have an ETH LST which is nothing special, but they are currently directing the governance fees they collect to their DAO which redirects those funds to the initiatives they value (ReFi, education, etc). Most people's exposure to crypto will be through CEX's and fintech, but they think that in emerging markets, stablecoins and p2p transactions will be the main demand.\n* Mike Silagadze of ether.fi (and someone from Chainnodes) explained the building blocks of a decentralized RPC via restaking. Providing RPC access is a natural fit for ETH restaking because stakers are already running the appropriate software. Restakers open access to their RPC and register with a smart contract. Load balancers (could be multiple, also registered with a contract) read the node registry and route requests to them. Get paid to do it right, and get slashed if you serve up provably incorrect information.\n* Garvit Goel of Electron Labs is looking to enable ETH stakers to provide security to Cosmos chains. I've imagined that the holy grail of inter-chain compatibility is when you can submit state proofs of one chain to another and actually get it all verified on the receiving chain. That's generally what they're doing: running an Ethereum zk light client on Cosmos (in development) and a Cosmos zk light client on Ethereum (live). With both of those in place (and some additional considerations), you have a trustless bridge through which it shouldn't be too hard to extend restaking to any Cosmos chains via IBC.\n\nLidoconnect talks were mostly about Lido (duh) but occasionally strayed into talks about Lido's impact on the broader ecosystem.\n\n* Isidoros \"Izzy\" Passadis, Lido's \"Master of Validators\" or something like that, looked at Lido's history through the lens of Lido's recently-ratified Purpose-Mission-Vision statement. Their agreed-upon core values are all about Ethereum security, censorship resistance, and decentralization, and Izzy summarized each year as working on one or two of these goals. Lido's share of the staking market has plateaued in the low 30%'s, something Izzy described as \"soft capped\" due to community pushback on Twitter. That's compared to the estimated 23% held by exchanges. Looking ahead, Lido's current goals (under their GOOSE system) are to improve governance, attract the best validator set, and make stETH the best token.\n* Mike Neuder of the EF presented his work on a set-theoretic view of Ethereum coteries. Danny Ryan kind of frontran his talk with Staking Gathering collecting the MEV, but this was a little different way of showing the model. Mike ran through 12 cases, 8 of which he also described in his original post. They describe situations relating the relative sizes of the sets of Ethereum users, holders, stakers, node operators, etc. The four extra were examples, showing how The DAO, Lido, a dominant L2, or Coinbase, could be seen in this model to cause systemic risk.\n* Sam of Lido covered Lido's proposed dual governance system. In this system, stETH token holders have limited influence over the LDO-run DAO. If an stETH holder doesn't like a certain proposal the DAO has passed, they can lock up their stETH in a veto. This places a timelock on all DAO governance, during which the *only* governance action that the DAO can take is to cancel the \"vetoed\" proposal. This buys time to draw more attention to potential issues with the proposal, which may cause more people to veto, which lengthens the timelock more. If the DAO decides to wait out the timelock, at the end all locked vetoing stETH is automatically exited to ETH (a \"rage-quit\") and the proposal is only enacted once they're all out.\n* A panel, with Kadmil and Sam of Lido, Rune Christensen of MakerDAO, and Charlie Feng of Agora, discussed governance mechanisms similar to Lido's proposed \"rage-quit\". Maker has a poison pill where even a minority of MKR holders can choose to shut down the entire protocol and close out all CDPs. Rune doesn't think this makes sense to have on a protocol that grows large enough to become systematically important. The security feature becomes an attack vector. Charlie talked about NounsDAO, which lets a 20% minority vote to fork off their own DAO. This has created more useful dialogue due to the threat of a fork, but has also been co-opted by (arguably?) bad actors. Very good discussion!\n* A panel, with Marin Tvrdi\u0107 of Lido, Justin Drake of the EF, Konstantin Lomashuk of cyber\u2022Fund, and Tarun Chitra of Gauntlet, discussed whether ETH or LSTs make for better money. The conversation jumped between a lot of topics and it's hard to summarize. There was some discussion of the medium-of-exchange view of money, but it mainly centered on store-of-value, or as they referred to it, ETH as collateral. Justin Drake is famously very opinionated about this, and drove much of the discussion towards how to remove remaining risk (mainly slashing) from ETH so that it can become maximally trustworthy as collateral.\n\nTomorrow I'm going to the second day of the Programmable Crypto Conference, which at this point will actually be a welcome change of pace from the staking-oriented stuff I've been seeing for a week.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Devconnect Day 7</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17vn3bx/daily_general_discussion_november_15_2023/k9elsp7/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I started off today with Blockswap Labs&#39; Restaking and MEV Intents Day.

This is the proces of [rationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology)) and it happens in 2 steps:\n\n1: Number goes up for a given reason, or no (known) reason at all.\n\n2:  Rationalization is performed, constructing a seemingly good or logical reason, as an attempt to justify it after the fact.\n\nA perfectly good reason for SOL to have gone up is because people are that people are preloading it as a bet on a new bull market happening. It fell as one of the hardest from ATH yet was still around. This reason would work even completely without considering what Solana is, it could have been a meme-coin for that matter.\n\nYet if you are in the Solana community, you will ascribe this pump to the fundamental better technology that Solana offers over ETH + L2s. You can see it on Twitter, the victory laps are not just about having made a good investment decision, but about Solana actually winning. Regardless of whether you believe in Solana's technology or not, this has yet to be proven. SOL/ETH has gone up. That means SOL has won over ETH in price action, nothing more. Yet people are conflating that with Solana technology + roadmap winning over ETH technology + roadmap. I don't have to tell you about the many examples of when price action going up meant absolutely nothing. So whatever decision you make, don't view this price action as evidence that Solana is winning.\n\n**What are Solana people right about in my opinion**\n\n* L2's are messy. Solana offers superior UX to newcomers *on the surface*\n* L2s are centralized\n* Fragmentation of liquidity is a problem *currently*\n* The current game of trading memecoins and narratives can also be done on Solana and it is likely that there will be big memecoins and NFT collections on Solana this cycle\n* Solana TVL and transaction count will probably rise as people will start speculating on Solana apps and Solana airdrops.\n* Solana has a great and easy narrative and might very well outperform ETH in this bull cycle. (also more risky though especially from this entry point)\n\n**What are Solana people wrong about in my opinion**\n\n* *Solana offers objectively better Defi than Ethereum because of its low fees, non-fragmented liquidity and easy UX without layers.*\n\nImo this is all well and dandy until the chain halts and you can't close your leveraged position or sell your shitcoin. Resilience is missing from the equation and it's absolutely fundamental.\n\n* *Solana is also decentralized to a degree and the difference is not that important.*\n\nFor many cases and applications this is probably correct, but this entire industry was build on the premise that everyone should be able to run their own node. With bandwith requirements, this is just not the case for Solana. I'm not going to go into too much detail here, but suffice it to say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\n\n* *L2s are not a good way to scale*\n\nFundamentally disagree and I think L2 scaling is the best way forward long term, but my guess is that this will not become obvious yet to everyone in this bull cycle. I will refer to a [previous comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17qf8oj/daily_general_discussion_november_8_2023/k8d9mzf/) for that one\n\n* *Real usage at scale is what leads to real value and hence real value capture*\n\nMy biggest criticism is not of Solana the network but the SOL token. There are plenty of web 2 protocols you can point to that have real use at scale that nonetheless do not accrue value. In fact the internet itself does not accrue value. As blockspace becomes cheaper and cheaper it essentially commoditizes and there will be no way to monetize. Yet Solana validators have high costs so they have to be subsidized. I don't see a possible path forward where it ever becomes profitable. This might not matter for price action in the coming year, but it will matter at some point. In fact my thesis for ETH value accrual is NOT mainstream usage, it's being the best collateral and collecting monetary premium.
