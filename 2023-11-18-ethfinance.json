The schedule does technically extend through Sunday, but that's just the final day of the coworking space and the ETHGlobal hackathon. I had considered doing a little bit of sightseeing in the morning, but it was raining decently hard and I would have been pretty pressured for time, so I decided against it. Instead I just went straight to the day's main event: censorship.wtf .\n\nAs you might expect, censorship.wtf was all about censorship: what are the problems and potential solutions, particularly as it pertains to Ethereum of course. The day was literally packed: between 11:00 and ~18:00 there were non-stop 20-minute talks scheduled. Not a single break, you just had to pick which talk excited you the least so you could cut out some time for a bathroom break and snacks. Using acronym \"censorship resistance\"=CR The content was mostly pretty good:\n\n* Juan Benet started the day with a high-level overview of factors that help or hinder in the struggle against modern digital totalitarianism. For example, we have surveillance everywhere, propaganda via modern computing, and social credit systems. These could be co-opted to empower a totalitarian society. To stave off totalitarianism we need education, string institutions, tech for secure communications and coordination, and a strong economy. Democracies are aware of the long-term danger, but are facing some actual short-term risks that they need to balance out. IP stack, CA system, app stores, and DNS are risky. ENS, IPFS, libp2p gud.\n* Vitalik Buterin talked about hardening the Ethereum ecosystem across the stack. Fun fact: one of Vitalik's addresses is banned from the main Uniswap frontend because it used Tornado Cash once long ago. Alternative frontends gud. Centralized node providers are scary, we need light clients and muliple providers for a nice 1-of-n security model. Attacks against the social layer are possible but instead of being optimizing for an objecting (\"convince everyone that ETH is bad\") it'll be about amplifying the worst voices on both sides to create a toxic culture. A 51% attack is not the cheapest way to break Ethereum; much easier to mess with IP, DNS, etc.\n* Sreeram Kannan introduced an observability gadget for CR. The question of \"how bad is censorship on Ethereum\" is hard to quantify but one metric is the time to censorship resistance (TCR), e.g. on ETH you usually don't have to wait too long to get a non-censoring proposer and builder, a few slots, so maybe a TCR of 0-40 seconds? But can we make it better? Proposed tx inclusion rule: when a block is proposed it must include tx's from recent uncles which have not already been included. With that as a rule, it follows that if a transaction is censored beyond a certain time, then >1/3 of stake can be slashed.\n* u/nixorokish of EthStaker explained that solo stakers are valuable for CR. A critical line of defense, even. Solo stakers make up somewhere between 35-75% of *nodes* on the network (if I heard that right), providing diversity across geography, ISP, hardware, and software. Solo stakers are engaged and fundamentally care about the network, seen in evidence that they run a more diverse set of clients than most. EthStaker working on getting the knowledge DB in more languages too. Kind of preaching to the choir here.\n* Sebastian B\u00fcrgel of hopr covered the topic of IP-level privacy. We all trust Infura from time to time to: deliver correct data, not censor, not track. The first two have been okay, tracking is a problem. Uniswap is bad: even on their IPFS deployment they track your device, addresses, and all your clicks, sending them back to their servers. Even if you're running on a decentralized frontend, if you connect to someone else's EL client for data, they can see what you're doing, link your on- and off-chain identities, and potentially abuse their position to frontrun whatever you're doing.\n* Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter of the EF examined censorship across the PBS stack. Proposers can censor in their own proposals, or take it further and not attest to certain blocks or even try to reorg them. Figment, Kraken, and Celcius are big censoring validators. Relay censorship has gotten quite a bit better since the Merge. Builder censorship on the other hand has gotten *very* concerning, like 80% censorship. Also examined feather forking on Bitcoin (link below), which lets even a minority miner compel other miners to censor the chain. On Ethereum this attack requires 51% of validators.\n* In the middle of the day, Mike Neuder of the EF led a breakout workshop where we mostly reviewed forward inclusion lists, discussed the implications, and briefly considered out-of-protocol solutions (e.g. enforced by relays). It was mostly review and getting a deeper understanding of the potential attacks, mitigations, and remaining limitations. I threw a link in the linkydoo. There are some interesting out-of-protocol options too. I covered MEV-Boost+ earlier this week, also possible for relays to enforce proposer-provided IL's or to just include transactions themselves.\n* Ed Felten discussed dealine protocols: any protocols that require on-chain transactions to occur before some deadline. These transactions can be censored though a combination of malicious (or bribed via mev-boost) proposers, and reorgs of honest validators' blocks. Censor it until the deadline has passed and you can do some damage. Ed designed a test that looks at the number of missed slots recently and computes with high probability if there has been no censorship.\n* Mallesh Pai of SMG presented their work on CR in on-chain auctions. They measure CR through the lens of how expensive it would be to censor a transaction. They mathematically model the cost of censorship on a blockchain and analyze the impact on on-chain auctions. In general they think it's pretty cheap to carry out attacks on them. They suggest that in each slot there should be *multiple* block proposals, which places the proposers in a sort of n-party prisoner's dilemma that should discourage censorship.\n* Justin Drake gave yet another talk, this time on weak censorship. He described his \"append test\" for censorship: if a transaction has been floating around a while and *could have* been appended onto the previous block, it's probably censored. Also, the bigger problems than censorship-induced inclusion latency and rollup throughput is the memetic cost. CR gives credible neutrality which gives social legitimacy which gives monetary premium which gives economic security and bandwidth. The idea that Ethereum is easily censored undermines that chain. He's optimistic about the combination of encrypted mempools, ILs, MEV burn, and ePBS. Also suggested some application of MEV burn rules to ILs, suggesting that a block would only be valid if it maximizes base fees?\n* In the final talk, Venkatesh Rao is thinking beyond exit and voice. \"CR is completing a transaction someone does not want completed, everything else is yield farming.\" When conflict arises, you have the choice to simply exit, or use your voice to participate in debate and discussion. Crypto has had a strong exit bias but CR is primarily a voice problem (not sure I agree?). Exit, taken to the extreme, gives you sovereignty but leaves you alone where you're no use to anyone. Bitcoin may accept that, but Ethereum probably shouldn't. There is also a tradeoff between efficiency and thoroughness. The Ethereum community can navigate the 2d space there: the exit-voice axis and the efficiency-thoroughness axis. Where do we want to be?\n\nI guess I'll do a final recap tomorrow. Flying out first thing in the morning back to the other side of the planet. Going to be a long trip.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Devconnect Day 9</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17x8g4p/daily_general_discussion_november_17_2023/k9nmpmg/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The last day of Devconnect!

They measure CR through the lens of how expensive it would be to censor a transaction. They mathematically model the cost of censorship on a blockchain and analyze the impact on on-chain auctions. In general they think it&#39;s pretty cheap to carry out attacks on them. They suggest that in each slot there should be <em>multiple</em> block proposals, which places the proposers in a sort of n-party prisoner&#39;s dilemma that should discourage censorship.</li>\n<li>Justin Drake gave yet another talk, this time on weak censorship. He described his &quot;append test&quot; for censorship: if a transaction has been floating around a while and <em>could have</em> been appended onto the previous block, it&#39;s probably censored. Also, the bigger problems than censorship-induced inclusion latency and rollup throughput is the memetic cost. CR gives credible neutrality which gives social legitimacy which gives monetary premium which gives economic security and bandwidth. The idea that Ethereum is easily censored undermines that chain. He&#39;s optimistic about the combination of encrypted mempools, ILs, MEV burn, and ePBS. Also suggested some application of MEV burn rules to ILs, suggesting that a block would only be valid if it maximizes base fees?</li>\n<li>In the final talk, Venkatesh Rao is thinking beyond exit and voice. &quot;CR is completing a transaction someone does not want completed, everything else is yield farming.&quot; When conflict arises, you have the choice to simply exit, or use your voice to participate in debate and discussion. Crypto has had a strong exit bias but CR is primarily a voice problem (not sure I agree?). Exit, taken to the extreme, gives you sovereignty but leaves you alone where you&#39;re no use to anyone. Bitcoin may accept that, but Ethereum probably shouldn&#39;t. There is also a tradeoff between efficiency and thoroughness. The Ethereum community can navigate the 2d space there: the exit-voice axis and the efficiency-thoroughness axis. Where do we want to be?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I guess I&#39;ll do a final recap tomorrow. Flying out first thing in the morning back to the other side of the planet. Going to be a long trip.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-18 14:01:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k9tchdn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17xzw1y","parent_id":"t3_17xzw1y","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/the-A-word","body":"Legend.. glad you enjoyed yourself seems like an epic trip.
