It works by having individuals show up online at a specified time to complete complex puzzles (called &quot;flips&quot;) with the idea that a real person could only do this one time - therefore, anyone who completes the flip task at a given time must be a real person. They also have a concept of staking, and there is intense mental work involved. Anyway, I&#39;m pretty interested in it and I&#39;ll probably keep learning about it awhile. Here&#39;s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYH7EQjas-c\">green pill interview with their founder</a>. I confess not being compelled by the interview, but I&#39;m still curious about anything that can improve sybil resistance.
