When they say they think that ETH should be staked by professionals, you should question why. I can't seem to find a good reason why. They also claim to be saving the network as they are more decentralised than stakers like Coinbase and they believe that the vast majority of the stake will fall into the hands of one entity. So therefore they think it should be them in the #1 spot. Push back against this. No one Bitcoin mining pool controls half of the hash power. So why would Ethereum staking \u2014 an even more easy to compete in field \u2014 be more centralised? Well maybe it's not because Lido is correct, rather because they want to convince you they are correct in an effort to stake more ETH, make more profits and control a larger share of the network.\n\n#Lido is a bad faith actor.\n\nTheir narratives are not truthful or evidence based. All of their narratives conveniently point back to them being good and the only way forward to save the network. They have no qualms in [applying for an enormous chunk of grant money that's intended to bootstrap new projects for their own liquidity](https://forum.arbitrum .foundation/t/lido-final-stip-round-1/17119/56) in an effort to squeeze out any healthy competition. That is despite their own multi-billion dollar treasury.\n\nIf someone could please run with this narrative of Lido's hypocrisy regarding professional stakers while having their own enormous security vulnerability and spread the word on crypto Twitter, that'd be great.

I already knew well back then to not keep coins on exchanges, so I didn't have any there. What I have there now, I bought deliberately for cents on the dollar in the critical downfall phase of mtgox, when withdrawals were already disabled on the exchange, but trading and depositing was still possible. I thought gox would recover and I would be able to get them out eventually. So I deposited cash and bought the btc there for ~150 USD each, when the open market price of btc was actually more like 400 or so. It was a gamble. If this turns out as a massive profit 10 years later, I'm fine with it (just wish I bought more haha).\n\nI did trade away most of my other btc though later and while I was completely aware of Ethereum starting, back then I was a diehard Bitcoiner and thought Ethereum was a dumb idea (\"who tf needs a turing complete blockchain\"). I know I deliberately decided it was not worth putting a single one of my 100+ btc into the ICO (which would have given me 2000 ETH).

Since I already showed &quot;early crypto adopter&quot; behavior in 2013, I wonder if I would have been interested by the Ethereum whitepaper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For me the coins I had on gox is basically just bonus anyway. I already knew well back then to not keep coins on exchanges, so I didn&#39;t have any there. What I have there now, I bought deliberately for cents on the dollar in the critical downfall phase of mtgox, when withdrawals were already disabled on the exchange, but trading and depositing was still possible. I thought gox would recover and I would be able to get them out eventually. So I deposited cash and bought the btc there for ~150 USD each, when the open market price of btc was actually more like 400 or so. It was a gamble. If this turns out as a massive profit 10 years later, I&#39;m fine with it (just wish I bought more haha).</p>\n\n<p>I did trade away most of my other btc though later and while I was completely aware of Ethereum starting, back then I was a diehard Bitcoiner and thought Ethereum was a dumb idea (&quot;who tf needs a turing complete blockchain&quot;). I know I deliberately decided it was not worth putting a single one of my 100+ btc into the ICO (which would have given me 2000 ETH). Still haunts me to this day, lol.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, forced hodl isn&#39;t the worst in the end. I know well I&#39;d probably not have used it any better.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-23 03:03:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kafbzi7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_181udkk","parent_id":"t1_kaf7vph","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Ethical-trade","body":">I already knew well back then to not keep coins on exchanges, so I didn't have any there\n\nWise man.
