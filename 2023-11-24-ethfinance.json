So we came up with a plan. We would sell enough to pay back our initial investment in his $ target range, then set some higher price targets that would net us enough to pay off the mortgage and still leave us with a decent hodl/staking/eth to 10k!!! stack. All of our targets hit and we paid off the mortgage in early 2021. That was just the beginning of the bull so the price kept soaring, more than doubling our highest sell, but it didn't bother me.
