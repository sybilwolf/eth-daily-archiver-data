The announcement of P2P to slightly delay the block production is nothing else than stealing the MEV from the following proposer to fill their pocket and increase stETHs APR. In the long term, this hurts the decentralisation and credible neutrality narrative. The protocol cannot defend itself against all attacks these actor are planning already or potentially could do if they grew larger. The question is then, how can the layer zero defend the protocol. Awareness campaigns have been important, but can only go that far. Lido has received a lot of push back from layer zero and ~~core devs~~ EF researchers. Lido, and today P2P, seem to be unfazed by this. In my view, any long term player in the Ethereum space would have taken the hint, but apparently Lido does not think they have to change their approach and pushes even harder. That is why I am personally ready to go a step further. I am not yet ready to slash Lido, or any large bad actor, to a more reasonable level. I am not against this approach, but I think we are just not there yet. At the moment I can imagine myself installing a node software which does the following. Just to be clear, I am not a protocol expert, so I might describe things wrong.:\n\n1. Do not forward, or aggregate attestations from lido validators. This is imho a relatively simple consensus layer change. It primarily hurts lido and also lowers network attestation efficiencies. We do not need all the Lido validators to be included. If most are we will be fine.\n\n2. Do not forward block proposals from Lido nodes. Again, a simple execution layer change. More proposals from them will be orphaned, which reduces attestation efficiencies. Network throughput will not be affected, thanks to EIP1559. The following blocks can increase their size without increasing gas prices. \n\n3. Do not include Lido attestations when I do a block proposal. This will hurt me and Lido and might paint a target on the back of my validator. But if they start retaliating hard they they will fork off into their own network.\n\nIn my understanding Lido has only a fraction of the actual nodes in the network, so we, the solo stakers and rocket pool operators, have a large leverage in forwarding  attestations and blocks. All these steps would definitely also hurt the credible neutrality of the network and set a bad precedent, but it is something each and every node operator can decide for themselves.
