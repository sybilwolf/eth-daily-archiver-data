There's a toxic masculinity amongst many rural workers (I would know, I work in agriculture) and one of the main ways it manifests is not caring about safety and PPE. It covers everything in this vein. From not wearing ear-muffs near loud equipment, wearing absolutely no PPE when applying herbicide while not reading the label and casually applying 8x the recommended dose (based on a true story) to not wearing a seatbelt and gun safety or a lack thereof.\n\nCritical thinking skills are not widespread amongst such people, so it is unsurprising for them to completely miss this hypocrisy. While I anecdotally see more of this from conservative types, there's no shortage of people on the left who are lacking in critical thinking skills too (especially as you go further left or away from the centre regarding auth/lib). In my experience there is marginally more of a lack of critical thinking from the right side of the isle.\n\nEdit: Come to think of it, the attitude to not wearing PPE does extend beyond rural quite a lot into general industry workers too.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Ironically I would also wager that there is a big crossover between people who have are convinced soy is bad and those who have a nice size bottle of roundup in their garage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Genuinely.
