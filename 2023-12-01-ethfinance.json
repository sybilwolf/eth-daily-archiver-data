This month the numbers are interesting. The validator count isn't changing as much as in the past months, client diversity is improving, but BSC also shows us how important it is. And last but not least Lido is gaining market shares again with the \"launch\" of Blast.  \n\n  \n**Validator overview - total: 1051685 validators\\***\n\n* 881447 active (November: 870084; +11363 / +1,3%, | May: 554322; +327125 / +59%)\n* 388 pending (November: 1024; -636 / -62,1% | May: 15537; -15154 / -97,5%)\n* 0 exiting (November: 722; 0 / -100% | May: 7333; -7333 / -100%)\n* 169613 exited (November: 126166; +43447 / +34,4% | May: 39341; +130272 / +331%)\n\nLooking at validator stats there are two changes that caught my attention: Active validator growth has notably slowed down. If we look at the entry queue, we see the first reason: There are still validators pending, but the number of validators waiting is basically 0 and nothing compared to the numbers we have seen during first months of the year. On top a huge number of validators has (at least temporarily) exited the beaconchain. More than 43k validators left. This might be explained by the issue one Lido service provider had. \n\n  \n**Client diversity numbers\\*\\***  \n*Consensus*\n\n* Prysm 41% (November: 43%, May: 38%)\n* Lighthouse 34% (November: 34%, May: 37%)\n* Teku 16% (November: 17%, May: 17%)\n* Nimbus 7% (November: 5%, May: 6%)\n* Lodestar 1% (November: 1%, May: 1%)  \n\n\n*Execution*\n\n* Geth 84% (November: 86%)\n* Nethermind 8% (November: 7%)\n* Erigon 2% (November: 2%)\n* Besu 5% (November: 5%)\n\n  \nClient diversity is sadly still a mixed bag. Consensus numbers keep on improving with Prysm slightly losing share. Nimbus with a rather huge increase (5 to 7.5% is a 50% increase) which of course is a very good movement. \n\nExecution keeps on being an issue. Geth's share with 84% is still way too high. Why? See u/superphiz [comment here yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/187bfcu/comment/kbeue2p/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Yes, Geth is battle tested. It's been around since years. But if there was a critical bug the potential paths are horrible (again, see superphiz' post). \n\nIf you run a validator, please think about switching to a minority client. It is not hard, I was able to do it and I have no idea what I am doing and downtime was minimal. I am sure the people over at r/ethstaker (and in discord) will happily assist you with every question you might have. \n\n  \n**Pool distribution\\*\\*\\***\n\n* Lido 32,3% (November: 31,4%)\n* Coinbase 14,2% (November: 13,7%)\n* Binance 4,1% (November: 4,5%)\n* Rocket Pool 2,9% (November: 2,9%)\n* Kraken 2,7% (November: 2,9%)\n* \\+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc.  \n\n\nWith the launch of Blast Lido has been gaining market shares again and is now again closer to the 33% mark. The only good news about this is, that this is basically where Lido was in September. But we should expect more inflows to Blast, so this number will increase... \n\nIf you have (w)stETH please think about withdrawing from Lido and/ or depositing into Diva. If you participate in the \"Diva vampire attack\" you will not only receive a new LST but also Diva tokens. \n\nRocket Pool is strong, Kraken and Binance losing market share. But in the end these mini changes aren't *really* important right now. The focus should be on Lido.   \nAll percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.  \n\\* https://beaconcha.in/validators#all  \n\\*\\* https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution  \n\\*\\*\\* https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Here&#39;s the eighth edition of the monthly staking update</strong></p>\n\n<p>One last time I would like to update you on the beaconchain.

For UX reasons stakewise v3 vaults are not able to change their fee after creation. Using simplified math we can get a rough estimate for how much the vault must charge in order to become \"self-sustainable\" in terms of maintaining the whitelist. As of right now SWISE v3 vaults do not support automatically checking for a depositor owning a particular NFT. This must be enforced via regular updates to a whitelist. Let's make some assumptions and/or state some facts:\n\n1. A conservative staking yield of 3% annually denominated in ETH per validator.\n2. There are economies of scale as there are more and more fully collateralized validators possible for a vault.\n3. Assume a cost of 0.005 ETH for each update of the whitelist with current NFT holders.\n4. For simplicity's sake we do not count additional MEV yield into these numbers and if they are included it undoubtedly improves the numbers favorably\n5. Any fees above 5% are unfeasible as that is the default fee that stakewise sets whenever you are creating a vault. Fees above 5% will not get any depositors nor will it provide any benefit to your community in terms of savings. In fact there are already many \"institutional\" vaults which offer \\~ 1-2% vault fees.\n6. I define a self-sustaining vault as one in which the fees taken in by the operator cover the whitelist transaction completely for each period.\n7. Gas fees will provide a drag on these numbers; as mainnet gets more and more expensive it will cost more to maintain the vault's whitelist.\n8. Assume I'm already a validator, but I've overprovisioned my hardware and want to try to provide low fee staking to members of my community who hold a specific NFT. However, I want to minimize the amount of ETH I must commit to sustain this endeavor.\n9. Yields do not compound within validators so I don't have to deal with exponential math.\n\nI will talk in the first person (as if I were the node operator) here as it's easier for me to write this way. Suppose I create a vault and provide no ETH deposits of my own. Given the above parameters, if I were to update this whitelist on an annual basis I only need to charge 0.52% on the vault to support a single validator's worth as a vault cap. Obviously this is too infrequent, holders of an NFT change much more frequently than that unless the project is dead. If I were to update the whitelist on a monthly basis this changes to a 6.25% fee minimum. Weekly is even worse at 27.08%. As more and more ETH is deposited into the vault the numbers improve. If 2 validators can be created from a vault it changes to 3.125% for monthly updates and 13.54% for weekly updates. And so on and so on. The more validators the vault can support the lower the minimum fee necessary to be self-sustaining.\n\nNow these numbers look pretty bad, but maybe if I seed the vault with some eth deposits I can use the yield from my collateral to cover the operational costs. If I seed the vault with 1 ETH of my own and commit to using the yield from my 1 ETH to subsidize the transaction costs we end up with the following minimum fee for the given update period to cover 1 validator:\n\n0% annually\n\n3.226% monthly\n\n24.73% weekly\n\nWith 2 ETH operator collateral the numbers are as follows:\n\n0% monthly\n\n22.22% weekly\n\nWith 3 ETH operator collateral:\n\n19.54% weekly\n\nWith the above in mind, let's try to figure out how many validators we need in order to get a reasonable fee % that is low enough to provide the NFT holders an actual benefit. Suppose I'm willing to seed the vault with 1 ETH indefinitely. In order to cover a weekly whitelist update transaction with a fee of 3% or less we would need to accumulate enough deposits for 8 validators. With 2 ETH collateral that number changes to 7 validators. 3 ETH collateral changes that to 6 validators.\n\nSo what do we do with all of the above information? With all of this I have determined that I could potentially provide this type of vault as a service by scaling the whitelist update frequency. By seeding 1 ETH collateral into the vault I could guarantee monthly updates with a 2% fee for 2 validators worth of deposits and if the deposits eventually exceed 12 validators I can then begin guaranteeing weekly updates. We can also clearly see how hard it is to compete with institutional staking providers. Economies of scale are incredibly powerful and it takes quite a lot of ETH in order to become self sustaining with reasonable fees. The good news is that this is only taking into account the base staking yield, and a conservative one at that. With MEV taken into account it opens up an alternative avenue to become self sustaining. The Operator could deposit more collateral at first, and as the surplus fee revenue comes in the operator can scale their original collateral out until fully divested.\n\nLet me know what you think of this. If anyone wants to see my spreadsheet to check my simplified math or challenge my assumptions I'll look into providing it. For now I'm personally leaning towards setting up a vault with monthly holder syncs with a 1% fee, 2 ETH seed and scaling out and increasing update frequency as either surplus fee revenue allows me to pull my seed out or enough ETH is deposited to reach the critical inflection point of self-sustainability. The biggest unknown is the cost of the whitelist transaction.

When you add DVT on top of this, you'll have higher costs and I don't think the 2-3% is going to even cover the associated costs (for 4 machines and people taking care of them) unless you have a ton of ETH deposited in your vault (not sure if that is realistic given this vault will only be open to ethfinance).\n\nJust my 2 cents.

You are afforded a bit of flexibility in accuracy but no one knows what you&#39;ve done in defi more than you.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 10:51:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbkzbid","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kbkuk66","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/im_THIS_guy","body":"Plus you can always use your crypto gains to hire a kickass tax attorney that will tie up the IRS in court for the next 8 decades.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Plus you can always use your crypto gains to hire a kickass tax attorney that will tie up the IRS in court for the next 8 decades.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 11:19:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbl3pno","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kbkzbid","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/tutamtumikia","body":"The concern I have is that the CRA may not have the ability to properly track things but they could do a worse job than I did at it and then decide I owe them even more money.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The concern I have is that the CRA may not have the ability to properly track things but they could do a worse job than I did at it and then decide I owe them even more money.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 10:35:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbkwot2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kbkuk66","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 10:41:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbkxphs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kbkwot2","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/tutamtumikia","body":"When you say \"accept the findings\" what does that mean?\n\nThe challenge is that the data from Koinly, while improving, has never been perfect either and takes a bunch of review to be sure it is tracking things properly.\n\nMaybe the 2023 tax year will be a lot closer to automatic though.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>When you say &quot;accept the findings&quot; what does that mean?</p>\n\n<p>The challenge is that the data from Koinly, while improving, has never been perfect either and takes a bunch of review to be sure it is tracking things properly.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the 2023 tax year will be a lot closer to automatic though.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 10:43:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbky2c2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kbkxphs","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Time for some only vaguely-related-to-crypto discussion.

While this is great for enabling access to staking yield to more people, in the same blog post they openly admit they only use Geth as their execution client (not sure if they ever confirmed it like this before, but everyone kind of knew). As the largest single staking entity (running around 15% of staked ETH) this is incredibly irresponsible behavior and they should be called out for it. I believe it is at this point in time a bigger issue than Lido having about 30%.</p>\n\n<p>If you have your ETH staked with Coinbase, move to a better alternative for the network (e.g. Rocket Pool / StakeWise V3 / ...).

I've occasionally been reading the [weekly newsletter](https://mirror.xyz/cryptouf.eth) /u/cryptouf makes but I haven't seen this mentioned yet. Amongst it there's a really cool revenue page that shows the profits of each parts of the system over time.\n\nWhat I find interesting at the moment is that the interest from crvUSD borrows has quickly outpaced the net trading revenue of Curve. I think this can be largely attributed to demand for leverage as people are positioning for an anticipated bull run. As the demand for leverage increased, the crvUSD peg started to drop. Once the peg-keepers became more exhausted it led to some automated interest rate increases. Now, all those open positions are paying some very high rates. Check this out:\n\n| Asset        | Borrow Interest Rate |\n|--------------|----------------------|\n| wstETH       | 21.33                |\n| wBTC         | 14.31                |\n| wETH         | 14.22                |\n| sfrxETH      | 20.30                |\n| tBTC         | 14.53                |\n| sfrxETH(old) | 18.48                |\n\nNow there's $144M crvUSD paying these rates. This led to $325k interest fees last week. Add that to $200k trading fees and they are generating over $500k fees per week right now. Will that hold? I'm not optimistic but the data shows no signs of them losing market share either. The high rates should cause the crvUSD market cap to fall a bit as borrowers deleverage or move their leverage to cheaper sources. But who knows, maybe the superior liquidation system here is worth paying a few percent premium for compared to Aave or Maker. On the other hand, these are basically crab market revenues which are guaranteed to pop a lot when the bull market arrives. Suffice to say $20M annual revenue is probably a neutral estimation for 2024 in the absence of a bull market. You can draw your own speculative premium for bull market trading revenue numbers.\n\nOne reason I care about it is, even speaking altruistically, this is one of the most decentralized stablecoin options invented. It's less governance heavy and more capital efficient than DAI or GHO, it's less centralized than FRAX and USDC, it's more stable than RAI, and your collateral is more protected than LUSD, GRAI, and mkUSD. So crvUSD adoption should be something we're all hoping for.\n\nIn terms of growth potential, crvUSD is clearly capped right now in the market cap it can support. It's basically an engine at its max load. It's clearly a cash cow though so what can the Curve DAO do to increase the load they can support?\n\n1) They can and should direct 'burner' profits from 3crv to crvUSD. This will turn all unclaimed fees into crvUSD which is just free demand. If this would buy crvUSD over $1, then the peg keeper will mint more crvUSD which is basically just charging a flywheel because that increases the crvUSD the engine can support.\n\n2) They could vote to direct crv issuance to a sale procedure that would buoy the peg-keeper reserves. Sell CRV, buy crvUSD, make LP, donate LP to peg-keeper. Basically they could directly back the crvUSD peg using exchange profits which would give it three distinct types of backing (collateral + reserves + income). This would lead to less weekly payouts for CRV holders right now but into an investment that would increase returns over time as the maximum crvUSD the system could support would compound and with that comes interest income. Would CRV voters enact such as procedure? How much are they making anyway?\n\nWell, if you want a quick place to check cvxCRV APY I'll point you to [Aladdin's Concentrator.](https://concentrator.aladdin.club/) aCRV there is just backed by cvxCRV where the profits are auto-compounded into more cvxCRV. Currently it's making 20.47%. **Yowza**. Now someone is going to quickly point out that some of this is inflationary and that's true. But even after subtracting inflation as a pure cost (which it isn't because there are systemic forced buyers of CRV like aCRV itself) you're still looking at over a 10-15% yield in inflation adjusted terms which is just incredible. So yeah, I think the Curve DAO could stand to direct some admin fees to investments in the crvUSD system.\n\n3) They can and are driving for more Defi integrations. crvUSD is being added to Aave basically right now. They should get this supported as an asset in Alchemix, GMX, etc. The more unincentivized hodlers of this they can get the better.\n\nPut together I hope they can drive some of that 100% YoY growth I'm looking for. Every crvUSD added to the peg keeper system can support 2-3x that in external crvUSD. So at a 15% APR, they could potentially be growing the crvUSD max load by 60% YoY. Add in some exchange profits to that mix and you could be looking at 100% YoY. Add in admin fees and get that even higher. Next bull market they could give DAI some competition (which would be a good thing at this point).\n\nIn the meantime, this is also one of the highest risk-adjusted yield stablecoins if you want to LP it. USDC+crvUSD is almost at 10% yield (it's historically been higher). FRAX+crvUSD floats around 15%. So there's good money to be made in the short term, even while supporting the growth of a decentralized stablecoin.

When the average investor treats crypto investing as just another asset class that makes sense to have exposure to, ETH will be far beyond $20k, and I think that happens in the next 5-10 years, especially with the ETFs.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 06:55:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbjxcua","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kbj15hq","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Good things rates change.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Good things rates change.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 07:05:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbjyv4r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kbj15hq","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/labrav","body":"jinxer","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>jinxer</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 01:38:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbj0rl0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kbj02lw","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/ev1501","body":"Gentlemen?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Gentlemen?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 08:44:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbkej32","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t3_1884mjc","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Tiny-Height1967","body":"Happy beacon chain launch 3rd anniversary \ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf04","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Happy beacon chain launch 3rd anniversary \ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf04</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 00:26:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbivmgx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t3_1884mjc","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/dvdglch","body":"Currently is my \u201ewill eth really come back and stay as strong as it is\u201c phase due to the current main narratives on CT, but the tec is also gud, but economically sound atm.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Currently is my \u201ewill eth really come back and stay as strong as it is\u201c phase due to the current main narratives on CT, but the tec is also gud, but economically sound atm.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 14:20:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kblw4u7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t3_1884mjc","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/ab111292","body":"Ratio looks cucked unless it bounces at trendline here\n\nDecision time for eth\n\nIs it weekends are for eth szn?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ratio looks cucked unless it bounces at trendline here</p>\n\n<p>Decision time for eth</p>\n\n<p>Is it weekends are for eth szn?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 13:25:03","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-12-01 13:41:30","id":"kblnlta","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t3_1884mjc","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/baggygravy","body":"Thanks for the depressing take - okay you're really good at this, I think the eth-usd is so key here in that we've bumped up against 2100-2140 a few times since last year, since the merge in fact - this can't be a quadruple top surely, if we get past 2200 then it's straight to 2500+ and the ratio recovers, that's what I'm wishing for anyway, what do you think.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for the depressing take - okay you&#39;re really good at this, I think the eth-usd is so key here in that we&#39;ve bumped up against 2100-2140 a few times since last year, since the merge in fact - this can&#39;t be a quadruple top surely, if we get past 2200 then it&#39;s straight to 2500+ and the ratio recovers, that&#39;s what I&#39;m wishing for anyway, what do you think.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 13:43:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kblqi5s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kblnlta","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ab111292","body":"Ideally this is the hl","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ideally this is the hl</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-01 14:00:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kblt4do","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1884mjc","parent_id":"t1_kblqi5s","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/tutamtumikia","body":"Fair point.
