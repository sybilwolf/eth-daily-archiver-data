This, in combination with my increasing bearishness on ATOM, incentivized me to unstake and buy SOL. My bearishness was a result of having used IBC and finding it extremely clunky and not user friendly, as well as the release of eigenlayer, which I felt drastically reduced the need for ATOM\u2019s primary future use case of interchain security. I find myself to be extremely lucky that price has performed in my favor here, because I definitely see a scenario where the opposite happened. Which brings me to my worst trade\u2026.\n\nWorst trade: LINK (@~$7) to ETH (@~$1800)\n\nI feel like LINK (and alternatively ETH) surprised a lot of people this year (myself included), and this one has eaten at me more than any other swap. LINK was my 2nd biggest position and I was buying the entire time it went down. I then hung around while it crabbed and literally sold the bottom a couple months before it went damn near parabolic. I swapped because I had gotten caught up in its consolidation phase and believed, due largely to token unlocks and oracle subsidies it was going to remain there. I had lost conviction on its real world use cases, that not surprisingly, I\u2019m starting to re-realize are vastly important for crypto in the future. \n\nI think the one thing to note here is that for my successful trade, I find myself lucky and for my unsuccessful trade I beat myself up for being stupid and having lost conviction on an asset I believed was going to be extremely useful. It\u2019s hard to beat this thought cycle, and I\u2019ve personally found the beginning of the bull to be more mentally exhausting than the majority of the bear. Constant FOMO and narrative catching have been causing me to be cautious of old habits I found myself doing in 2021. \n\nSo not much to learn here but tl;dr would be we all make good and bad trades and try to understand this is just the price of admission for being here and maybe try to learn from both your successes and mistakes. \n\nGLTA!!!!!!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So considering this is my freshman bear/bull cycle I\u2019ve done a bit of consolidation of my (numerous) alt positions from 2021 into mostly ETH and a few alts I believed would outperform. Some have played out very well, and some not so much. I thought I\u2019d share with you guys my best and my worst trade and some thoughts I\u2019ve had about them. </p>\n\n<p>The best: ATOM (@~$9) to SOL (@~15) </p>\n\n<p>Obviously we are all aware of how SOL has performed this cycle but the reason I swapped was mainly due to a friend I had (who works at messari) had become drastically more bullish on SOL over the course of the year. This, in combination with my increasing bearishness on ATOM, incentivized me to unstake and buy SOL. My bearishness was a result of having used IBC and finding it extremely clunky and not user friendly, as well as the release of eigenlayer, which I felt drastically reduced the need for ATOM\u2019s primary future use case of interchain security. I find myself to be extremely lucky that price has performed in my favor here, because I definitely see a scenario where the opposite happened. Which brings me to my worst trade\u2026.</p>\n\n<p>Worst trade: LINK (@~$7) to ETH (@~$1800)</p>\n\n<p>I feel like LINK (and alternatively ETH) surprised a lot of people this year (myself included), and this one has eaten at me more than any other swap. LINK was my 2nd biggest position and I was buying the entire time it went down. I then hung around while it crabbed and literally sold the bottom a couple months before it went damn near parabolic. I swapped because I had gotten caught up in its consolidation phase and believed, due largely to token unlocks and oracle subsidies it was going to remain there. I had lost conviction on its real world use cases, that not surprisingly, I\u2019m starting to re-realize are vastly important for crypto in the future. </p>\n\n<p>I think the one thing to note here is that for my successful trade, I find myself lucky and for my unsuccessful trade I beat myself up for being stupid and having lost conviction on an asset I believed was going to be extremely useful. It\u2019s hard to beat this thought cycle, and I\u2019ve personally found the beginning of the bull to be more mentally exhausting than the majority of the bear. Constant FOMO and narrative catching have been causing me to be cautious of old habits I found myself doing in 2021. </p>\n\n<p>So not much to learn here but tl;dr would be we all make good and bad trades and try to understand this is just the price of admission for being here and maybe try to learn from both your successes and mistakes. </p>\n\n<p>GLTA!!!!!!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-04 04:51:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kby42fn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18adty2","parent_id":"t3_18adty2","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/wordlemcgee","body":"Which alts do you like and currently hold?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Which alts do you like and currently hold?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-04 07:33:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbyoyau","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18adty2","parent_id":"t1_kby42fn","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/theethmeister","body":"Look, between the time here and in various Discord chats I am seriously starting to reconsider my sell-off strategy with everyone's bullishness.

What happens to assets stuck in smart contracts? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1731733161988505930?t=UyStYfDbNJxF5xfh2EexMA&amp;s=19\">https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1731733161988505930?t=UyStYfDbNJxF5xfh2EexMA&amp;s=19</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>L2s make Ethereum <em>more fragile</em>. This becomes especially clear during a time of crisis.</p>\n\n<p>For example, consider an L2 liveness failure for an L2 (ORU or ZKR, doesn&#39;t matter) that has 20M users. The sequencer stops proposing blocks for some indeterminate period of time</p>\n\n<p>Assume that users 1) are notified of this immediately (this is an extremely optimistic and invalid assumption, but let&#39;s roll with it for now), and 2) they have an accessible UI that they can go to to start withdrawing down to L1</p>\n\n<p>What happens in this situation?</p>\n\n<p>1) users who have assets in a contract (eg a perp DEX or borrow/lend protocol) are fucked. they have no way of getting out at all</p>\n\n<p>2) users who have direct control over their assets can withdraw (unclear to me exactly how SC wallets such as multi-sig Safes would operate in this environment..... they could have serious problems too)</p>\n\n<p>Gas spikes immediately on L1 as some % of users withdraw. Which increases gas costs for all other L2s</p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of users are unable to get out in any reasonable period of time, given L1 throughput constraints</p>\n\n<p>In order for a system to be considered resilient, it needs to be designed to remain stable during a time of crisis. </p>\n\n<p>Or as my colleague @kankanivishal recently noted, &quot;finance needs to be designed pessimistically&quot;</p>\n\n<p>During a crisis, problems compound in all kinds of unforseeable ways. Fragility will inevitably lead to accentuating crises</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-04 10:15:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kbzf6y2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18adty2","parent_id":"t3_18adty2","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/15kisFUD","body":">users who have assets in a contract (eg a perp DEX or borrow/lend protocol) are fucked. they have no way of getting out at all\n\nCurious about this also, is this true or is there any other way to access these eventually given enough time?
