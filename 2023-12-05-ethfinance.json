As we enter 2023 and beyond, I staunchly believe Ethereum provides the better foundation for what blockchain was always meant to represent - whether the masses realize it yet or not. We have the developer momentum. We have the real-world use traction. And we have a vision much more aligned with the borderless, decentralized ethos that compelled so many of us to this movement in the first place.\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains fixated on glorified digital gold propped up by energy-guzzling mines, Ethereum is pursuing a genuinely sustainable and accessible blockchain future. One defined by possibility rather than preservation. By global community not geographical enclaves. By unleashing unprecedented innovation, not warehousing wealth for its own sake.\n\nMake no mistake - I have tremendous respect for the OG chain. But Bitcoin has become too entrenched in its own maximalist narrative to continue dominating the broader public's idea of this industry. As ecosystem-builders it's on us to reshape that mainstream perspective. To convey why Ethereum adoption from JP Morgan to special ops groups to Canadian coffee shops matters. To spread awareness of the revolutionary potential of DeFi and DAOs that would make a cyberpunk fan blush.\n\nThe king's crown may slip in due time. But we don't have to wait for market rankings to flip - we have the power to reshape the narrative now. We can make Ethereum every bit as synonymous with blockchain's future as Bitcoin has been with its early past. The building blocks are there if we message it right. It's time more people realize what this movement was always meant to look like.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The ICO boom was supposed to be Ethereum&#39;s coming out party - our shot to challenge Bitcoin&#39;s stranglehold as the flagbearer of blockchain technology. &quot;You come at the king, you best not miss.&quot; Despite all the hype and developer activity flocking to Ethereum during 2017-2018 though, we just didn&#39;t flip the script on what the average person visualizes when they hear &quot;blockchain.&quot; Bitcoin still occupies that mental real estate.</p>\n\n<p>But pumped up market caps shouldn&#39;t dictate public perception. As we enter 2023 and beyond, I staunchly believe Ethereum provides the better foundation for what blockchain was always meant to represent - whether the masses realize it yet or not. We have the developer momentum. We have the real-world use traction. And we have a vision much more aligned with the borderless, decentralized ethos that compelled so many of us to this movement in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>While Bitcoin remains fixated on glorified digital gold propped up by energy-guzzling mines, Ethereum is pursuing a genuinely sustainable and accessible blockchain future. One defined by possibility rather than preservation. By global community not geographical enclaves. By unleashing unprecedented innovation, not warehousing wealth for its own sake.</p>\n\n<p>Make no mistake - I have tremendous respect for the OG chain. But Bitcoin has become too entrenched in its own maximalist narrative to continue dominating the broader public&#39;s idea of this industry. As ecosystem-builders it&#39;s on us to reshape that mainstream perspective. To convey why Ethereum adoption from JP Morgan to special ops groups to Canadian coffee shops matters. To spread awareness of the revolutionary potential of DeFi and DAOs that would make a cyberpunk fan blush.</p>\n\n<p>The king&#39;s crown may slip in due time. But we don&#39;t have to wait for market rankings to flip - we have the power to reshape the narrative now. We can make Ethereum every bit as synonymous with blockchain&#39;s future as Bitcoin has been with its early past. The building blocks are there if we message it right.
