Allocated to a little under 300 projects (out of about 650 that passed through the initial filtering).\n\nHonestly, this was a ludicrous amount of work, and I'm very glad we had such a long time to do it (4 weeks). The process of assesing and evaluating has probably consumed about 40 hours (rather than the 8 estimated at the beginning, lol).\n\nProjects need to get onto 17 ballots to qualify for anything, then will they recieve the median amount from those ballots. To see which projects have got how many ballots so far check out:\n\nhttps://www.growthepie.xyz/optimism-retropgf-3\n\nIt's been quite sad to see the amount that some projects have felt forced to shill themselves to badgeholders, and also that it seems to have worked which will encourage more of it in the future. Just one example that I saw was Sonne, a fork of Compound, whose token holders clearly brigaded the OP Discord and now has reached quorum. How is a DeFi lending platform, with a token, a 'Public Good'? I have no idea, but they are far from the only example.\n\nLefteris has been trying to point out that some of the projects which most quickly reached 17 ballots are things which really don't need an extra injection of funds due to huge amounts of VC funding. \n\nAn example of this that I find particularly egrigious would be Synthetix, who not only received $20M in VC funding this year, but previously received 9M OP... of which they then used about 2M to give themselves a huge amount of governance power...\n\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/synthetix-ambassadors-phase-0-delegation-2m-op-tokens/3726\n\n... and then used that voting power to nominate their ambassador as a RetroPGF badgeholder:\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x22d4c3ab56832de58c1774d1a0aeb61ba6dde8b16c0f8382f85d8935f3ee1f11\n\nSynthetix are obviously huge in the Optimism ecosystem, and generate a lot of value... but I wouldn't suggest they are the most worthy recipients of 'public goods' funding. \n\nAnyway, governance is never perfect, Moloch is always present, and I'm sure we can learn and iterate over time.

Listening to Andreas Antonopoulos, reading about decentralized marketplaces (open bazaar), crypto anarchists, colored coins, Proof of Work, Proof of Stake and PeerCoin, getting scammed by Neo Bee.</p>\n\n<p>Each cycle felt like the players were getting bigger in size. At first it was just computer techies dumping on each other. Then retail came and capitulated. VCs eventually arrived last cycle to buy coins at inflated values and capitulated at the bottom. Many being forced to sell BTC at pico-bottom prices.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we&#39;re seeing actual world governments/countries buying BTC, I wonder if this is the cycle where we see the capitulations of actual countries? In 2-3 years from now, are we going to read about El Salvador/UAE selling BTC? Are some poorly governed countries going to be just as degenerate as others were in previous cycles - leverage buying BTC only to blow up in spectacular fashion?</p>\n\n<p>With Tesla and Microstrategy holding Bitcoin I thought we would level up this cycle to publicly traded companies engaging in ape like behavior, that eventually blow up. The idea that developing countries with poor economies and government accountability could easily become degenerates is honestly worrisome.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-05 23:56:40","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-12-05 23:59:50","id":"kc7be4o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18bxesk","parent_id":"t3_18bxesk","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/aaj094","body":"Which countries do you mean (other than El Salvador)?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Which countries do you mean (other than El Salvador)?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-06 00:59:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kc7fugd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18bxesk","parent_id":"t1_kc7be4o","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Qatar and the UAE is noodling with a sovereign wealth fund, if I'm not mistaken.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Qatar and the UAE is noodling with a sovereign wealth fund, if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-06 02:08:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kc7kmhz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18bxesk","parent_id":"t1_kc7fugd","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/aaj094","body":"Source that such a fund is considering crypto allocation?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Source that such a fund is considering crypto allocation?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-06 02:11:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kc7kuw7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18bxesk","parent_id":"t1_kc7kmhz","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Sure.
