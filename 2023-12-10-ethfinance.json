Reverse regulatory capture effects must happen behind closed doors, which means the government is stuck in a Catch-22 where a public ledger will always reveal what just happened and probably trigger a fork. If you want a dystopian CBDC, you actually must be on a *privacy chain* because then things can be hidden from public view...but that would allow tax evasion.\n\nSo yeah, I think there will be *significant* attempts to corrupt many blockchains, but the combination of blockchain exploring and the hard forking nuclear option means that it almost doesn't actually matter how centralized chains actually get.

So to be able to cash out an additional $300k to make an outright purchase of a modest house your stack would need to be around $1 million before you make the ETH sale.  </p>\n\n<p>This approach might not be optimal in terms of expected returns (for example if you have conviction that ETH is going to quintuple in value then it isn&#39;t particularly rational to sell at a lower ETH price for one of your lower rungs). However I find it a nice compromise in terms of getting some life benefit out that you might miss entirely if you hold out for your expected ETH price which may never come. Nothing in this space is guaranteed and black swans can happen.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-10 12:46:49","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-12-10 14:06:01","id":"kct99wx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18ewx8m","parent_id":"t3_18ewx8m","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/imaybeslow","body":"This is how I view it as well, since crypto is only one part of my investment strategy, at the long tail of risk.
