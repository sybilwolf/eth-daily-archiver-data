At the moment, gnosis chain is humming along doing 5.6 million transactions per day (https://gnosisscan.io/chart/tx). This is about 5 times what Ethereum does at the moment (https://etherscan.io/chart/tx). But how come it does so much more when from a simple block size (17 Million gas) and block time (5 seconds) estimate gnosis chain has only 36% more capacity than ethereum. The reason is pretty simple: ordinal style inscription transactions.   \nAfter ordinals and BRC20 turned into a cash cow on Bitcoin, the inscription meme started to spread onto other chains. Litecoin, Dogecoin, Avalanche (https://blockworks.co/news/avalanche-ordinals-asc20-transaction-record), Solana (https://twitter.com/heliuslabs/status/1727821287052153032) and many EVM chains have been 'blessed' by them (https://twitter.com/hildobby\\_/status/1732367771915399556). And now, Gnosis chain was also discovered by some inscription project. I have no idea which inscription project uses gnosis chain.   \nAn inscription is a very lightweight transaction  and uses about 22'000 gas, which is only slightly more than a simple ETH transaction which takes 21'000 gas (https://gnosisscan.io/tx/0x394db9fa1d92ab2c8888bed6ca2db7a543de3bc86e1db22a0e7e0a03c121e170). Doing the math with 300E9 gas per day, 50% average block usage and 22'000 gas per inscription, we get 6.8 million transactions per day, which is pretty close to the observed 5.6 million transactions. Gnosis chain seems to be pretty close to capacity. This is reflected in the gas prices of up to 350 gwei over the weekend. Normally, the gas prices are rather in the low 2 digit region. From yesterday to today, there were several thousand xDAI burnt as base fee. This magnitude is pretty impressive, as normally there was not a lot of burning going on on gnosis chain.  \nI got the impression that some public RPC nodes seem to struggle a bit. I guess they are being bombarded with transactions and general requests. My local node does not seem to have any issues with the amount of transactions. Block execution takes around 10-40 ms which is pretty normal or even slightly better than usual. No problem here.  \nCurrently, over 90% of all gnosis chain transactions are inscriptions (https://dune.com/p\\_dot/ordinals-inscriptions-are-surging-in-all-evms). On most chains, these inscription transactions have been a short lived phenomenon of a few days and then subsided again. I think only on Polygon the are running strong now for 3 weeks.
