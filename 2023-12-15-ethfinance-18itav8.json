all sorts of junk food like donuts, potato chips, and 8 varieties of cheez-its and yet later claim that they aren't like a fast food joint and even go on to run an ad where they imply they are a source of healthy and nutritious food?\n\nThe answer is that supermarkets sell junk food because there's demand for it, plain and simple. Not as many people would shop at a supermarket that only sold healthy food, even though everyone would be healthier if junk food weren't sold at any supermarkets. On top of that, junk food sales tend to make the supermarket a lot more money than healthy food sales. In fact, many supermarkets wouldn't be financially viable without the profits that junk food brings in. But that doesn't detract that a supermarket is an overall force for good, providing access to fresh healthy produce to your community.\n\nBasically, don't blame the sellers, blame the buyers. They know which types of cryptocurrency are nutritious for their portfolio, yet they continue to buy doge and bonk because they don't want a portfolio, they want a lottery ticket. If nobody were buying them, Coinbase wouldn't list them. Throughout all the noise, Coinbase continues to provide access to more nutritious cryptocurrencies, so they deserve to advertise that they are a force for good. It's not like they're trying to pass off bonk as a healthy part of everyone's portfolio, just as your supermarket isn't trying to pass off cheez-its as nutritious.\n\nAs a final note, brokerages do the exact same thing with their junk penny stock and options offerings juxtaposed against their large-cap retirement account offerings. It's the same \"junk product, healthy product\" market segmentation strategy. Robinhood even gamified options trades to the point where they had to apologize and remove the confetti animations from their app whenever you place a trade. I think if we get to the point where the Coinbase app has confetti animations when you buy a shitcoin, that's the point where it makes sense to talk about it being a casino. Otherwise, it's a supermarket.\n\nEdit: If you want your blood sugar to have an exciting short-lived bull market with a blow-off top and a crash, buy candy. If you want your blood sugar to have a healthy long-term secular market, buy an apple.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How come supermarkets carry all sorts of junk food like donuts, potato chips, and 8 varieties of cheez-its and yet later claim that they aren&#39;t like a fast food joint and even go on to run an ad where they imply they are a source of healthy and nutritious food?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is that supermarkets sell junk food because there&#39;s demand for it, plain and simple.
