Nothing about an ETF approval was on my radar at the beginning of the year. It really wasn't until Greyscale won their lawsuit against the SEC that the winds changed here and that was towards the middle of the year. The recent price action appears to me to mostly have been driven by the ETF narrative.\n\n2) Fed rates would basically hold all year. Stablecoins market cap would shrink as money was extracted to t-bills.\n\nUSDT has gone from $65B->$90B. USDC has gone from $44B->24B. DAI has gone from $5B to $5B. Everything else is too small to matter at that scale. Overall this prediction happen, though I still stand behind the reasoning of it that Defi rates were going to remain suppressed as long as the Fed rates remained high and this would vaccuum capital out of Defi. So basically we've just seen the more legit stablecoin shrink and lose market share to Tether. Overall the *stickyness* of stablecoin market cap has got to be bullish even if I don't like the direction of the power curve winner(s).\n\n3) We'd see the first treasury bill RWA's. This would become a major thing by the end of the year.\n\n[$766M](https://app.rwa.xyz/) today. The high fed rates basically killed a fledgling mortgage RWA industry.\n\n4) The ETH exchange reserve would continue to fall by 6M per year leading us one year closer to a supply crunch.\n\nWe started the year at 18.4M. We're currently at 14.3M. So that's another miss. This one is more heartbreaking to me. Given that Coinbase is the custodian for most ETFs, I actually expect this figure is going to stall even further next year. It's really starting to break my supply crunch hypothesis. I had a lot of hope riding on that one.\n\nI had some other things on the list like the death of NFTs, Eigen Restaking coming online, etc but those are the big ones. So overall, I did *ok*. I hit a few, missed a few, but I'm not in harms way from any of it.\n\nNow, since I never learn here's predictions for 2024. There's a bunch of factors that all seem to be converging in a positive way for next year. First, it looks to me like the Fed pivot has begun. We knew this would happen eventually just because of the $1.7T deficit powered by these interest rates so it was basically a staring contest between inflation and the deficit. The bond market is pricing in several rate reductions next year. This of course will lead capital to more risk seeking activity. Second, there is the BTC halvening and standard 4 year cycle. It doesn't even matter if it's just self-fulfilling, it's going to create tailwinds on price. Third, there are a lot of ETF filings in the pipe and after the Greyscale lawsuit win this year I don't know if the SEC wants to get in a situation where the courts to literally order them to approve one. Imagine how much face they'd lose. So with those macro notes as a backdrop, here's some more predictions for me to get wrong!\n\n1) I think we'll see stablecoin market cap start to blossom again this year. Even a +100% growth seems potentially conservative to me. We've got major players like Paypal offering stablecoins now, banks in Europe accepting stablecoin deposits, forex possibilities with Dex's, more stablecoin adoption in Latin America even if it's primarily on Binance and Tron, dozens of CBDC's in development, etc. The fact that stablecoin market cap didn't shrink under a relatively hostile environment is fundamentally bullish for adoption. When those headwinds change to tailwinds we could see it really rip. Those gains will be dominated by centralized coins but there are good scalable decentralized stablecoins now too. For example, I'd personally like to see crvUSD and mkUSD hit $300M next year. The best way to defeat people like Warren is to get her bank funders to tell her to stfu. The best way to do that is to get them interested in stablecoin adoption themselves. This appears to be primed to happen overseas before it happens at home but every little drip creates pressure.\n\n2) [Restaking](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/restaking). EigenLayer is behind schedule but I still think this is going to be out in a big way next year. Despite offering absolutely nothing for it every time they open the deposit gates they get flooded. To me this is the most bullish ETH fundamental narrative I have going right now. A bunch of native token collateral protocols basically get vampired by easy forks that swap out the collateral layer to ETH. Celestia surprised me with its market cap as a DA layer with absolutely nothing going for it. I can't wait to see the hype EigenDA can do without a bs Cosmos chain gumming up the works.\n\n3) The ETF's are too hotly anticipated. While I do think in like 5-10 years there will be $100B in those ETF's invested in crypto, how much demand is really going to materialize on day one that isn't already absorbed into Greyscale products? I'll be pleasantly surprised if Bitcoin ETFs get $1B inflows on day one. Amongst those biting on that, most of them don't really understand BTC and if they are only putting 1% allocation into crypto they probably aren't going to split it any further than that. When we get an ETH ETF I expect it to underwhelm.\n\n4) Gamefi is primed to go. Session signatures are coming along nicely as is account abstractions on zk chains. When the games are willing to pay your gas for you and you don't have a wallet in the way of the experience these things can come to life. Our little ethfinance baby InfluenceEth is on the cusp of their Exploitation release. Illuvium numbers look good even if their strategy looks like a mess to me. There are crypto games on the Epic games store now. Having digital assets that you can take to Defi markets is a pretty cool thing. Having a payment rail from your game company to each of your customers opens up some pretty cool possibilities. The gameplay itself has been lacking on the stuff I have tried so far but eventually someone is just going to make a *good* game that happens to use a blockchain in an inseparable way and I'll be here for it.\n\n5) Between the Fed pivot creating risk appetite across the market, the BTC halvening and the self-fulfilling 4 year cycle, and BTC ETF inflows I think we have some strong tailwinds behind the crypto total market cap for 2024. The ETH specific tailwinds are just restaking, high burn, and slowly depleting exchange reserves. I don't know if those fundamentals outpace just the mindswarm of CT bashing on Ethereum all the time to create a good year for Ray. Without a good marketing arm ultimately sentiment follows price and price lags fundamentals by years. I'm certainly not holding my breath for the flippening this year, but I do have my rocketship ticket for $10k regardless. Since I'm foolishly inclined to put a number on it, I'll guess ETH will lag BTC but will still get dragged alongside it to a new ATH next year. I'll see y'all when the $5k wall falls.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Reflecting on some predictions I made last year:</p>\n\n<p>1) ETH would crab between $1k-$2k all year.</p>\n\n<p>This one appears to have been <em>directionally</em> correct.
