We do not know how independent they are, but someone asked an interesting question a few days ago: ['Why does solana have over 10% of its validators in Ogden (Utah)'](https://old.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/18f6sdd/why_does_solana_have_over_10_of_its_validators_in/).

So it seems slightly delayed. \n\nIf you click on 'staked nodes', which are nodes that are also validating, solana has close to 2000. Do not ask me why there are more staking nodes than actual nodes in some locations. Maybe these numbers are filtered in a certain way. Maybe the numbers are just delayed and fast relocations of the nodes gives these weird results. I do not know. 123 of the staking nodes are in Ogden (6%). The bar chart to the right still has Ogden listed with 314 (16%). But now, Wichita seems to have 492 of them, which is a staggering 25% of all solana staking nodes. This in itself is not a healthy number being in one location. What I think is even worse is that it looks like hundreds of nodes have been moved from one location to another within days. \n\nI would interpret that as a single entity has control over a large part of these nodes/validators and moves them around at a whim.

Phantom wallet is way better than Metamask and any wallet for any other chain that I've experienced. You can still enjoy the defi, NFTs, etc but for low prices so it's more appealing to masses. All of that is good until you hit their main concern, so let's get into cons.\n\nCons: when needed aka when demand comes in the shit doesnt work but even w/o that half of the time my TXs on dexes don't go thru. I'm assuming when there would be even more demand in the bull run the chain would stop or half of the shit wouldnt work. So yes, the fees are low but the chain doesn't work. It doesn't make me feel secure to hold more than a few $k on the chain and I'm sure real world whales wouldn't want the chain to stop at any time either. \n\n> AVAX.\n\nI might've gotten to degen there in the wrong time but the fees WERE INSANE. I paid more than Ethereum fees for prices. I don't know what their adv is and I don't care, the experience sucks. Oh, and I also have gotten my TX's failing for unknown reasons while still losing like $10-20 on trying to swap..\n\n> Cardano.\n\nCardano is a poor man's Solana.

I hold zero SOL and these statements are not my opinion</p>\n\n<p>- Survived an extinction event with FTX similar to ETH in 2018, yet builders remained active enough to keep building</p>\n\n<p>- Much higher upside than ETH because market cap is only 1/8th of ETH&#39;s market cap</p>\n\n<p>- Will continue to steal market share from ETH in terms of TVL and daily active users.</p>\n\n<p>- Better UX because everything can be done on the same chain</p>\n\n<p>- SVM is more efficient than the EVM because of parallel execution</p>\n\n<p>- Very cheap fees / High TPS</p>\n\n<p>- Will unlock usecases that are not possible with Ethereum</p>\n\n<p>- Now that a few succesful airdrops have launched, growing TVL and user activity because people will farm more airdrops and this is also where most ETH L2 activity comes from.</p>\n\n<p>- Decentralized enough 3000+ validators, higher nakamoto coefficient than ETH.</p>\n\n<p>- Defi and NFTs are mostly about speculation anyway, what&#39;s required for speculation is virality and virality is faster when fees are cheap. See BONK.</p>\n\n<p>- Scaling via L2 is not real scaling because you fragment network effects and ruin user experience with bridiging. Real scaling only happens on L1 and for that node requirements have to be higher.</p>\n\n<p>- L2s are more centralized than Solana</p>\n\n<p>- New entrants won&#39;t have the same standards for decentralization as current crypto natives.
