If you believe in Ethereum's scaling vision you should probably at least familiarize yourself with DALs. DALs are where data is socialized so that rollup sequencers don't have god tier powers. Without the DAL, dispute-based systems like optimistic rollups don't work. A sequencer could steal funds for example and no one would have the data required to dispute that. At the very least an L2 without a DAL can just halt and no one can pick it up from where it halted to continue the chain.\n\nToday's rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, etc) use Ethereum for DA and settlement. The DA portion of that is about 90% of their cost. What this actually means is they publish a proof to Ethereum's mainnet in calldata. This is like 10x cheaper than using Ethereum for execution but is still 10x more expensive than it needs to be. This extra cost is for paying for an unnecessary level of resilience. Calldata is permanent. Anyone can download the calldata of the entire L1 chain since genesis. For example, check out the massive data input field to this [transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xba362b0a885281803b725a1e83a7437823c0f4d06ead17bdd4d9f3097b867618).\n\nThe thing is, L2's don't need this kind of permanence. Once something is past the fraud proof window for your optimistic rollup and it couldn't be contested anyway, what's the value in paying to store it forever? So this is what DALs are really about; reducing costs by not paying for permanence when you don't need it.\n\nNow, within that framework we have Celestia which uses DA sampling and EigenDA which uses DA scaling. DA scaling (EigenDA) acts a bit like your old [RAID-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels) drive arrays where the full drive can be reconstructed even if one of the drives in your array fails. Instead of parity bits they use a fancy cryptographic thing called [erasure coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code). This reduces the number of drives that have to continue functioning from n-1 to sqrt(n). Of course when your failure rate can be that high not every node has to have all the data; so they don't. Pretty fancy. Basically it reduces the copy count of the data a lot while retaining acceptable resilience. DA sampling (Celestia) acts closer to RAID1 where all of the data is still on every drive. This makes the DA nodes comparatively heavy. So what's the advantage? They add a bunch of light nodes called the Halo Network that are able to prove whether the nodes are lying or are withholding the data. This proof allows you to hold the DA nodes accountable (slashing). So the savings is less on reducing replication at an architecture level but by making the nodes more trustworthy so fewer of them are needed. As a net result it looks to me like EigenDA is focused on the most economical scaling possible and Celestia is focused on maximum resilience possible. Apparently it's hard to combine these approaches. I'm going to unnecessarily stick my neck out and say I think the EigenDA solution is conceptually better on that front. \n\nThere are implications for which you should use as a sovereign rollup. This gets a little more technical than I'd like. If you are using another blockchain for settlement (finality), ultimately you are relying on that blockchain to establish the order in which things happen. By giving up the power of settlement, you are already giving up some of the options of what you can accomplish with a hard fork. Otherwise this section of the video got a little hard for me to follow.\n\nEigenDA is more Ethereum-aligned economically and more specialized for Ethereum-rollups. First, I'd expect many Ethereum validators to restake and also be EigenDA nodes. Economically, it's more aligned for a rollup that is using ETH for its gas token and Ethereum for its settlement to keep the DA fees internal to the Ethereum ecosystem than it is to outsource that revenue to TIA stakers. Second, as a point of specialization, EigenDA only has to offer data attestations (proof of custody) and it doesn't need to provide its own consensus and settlement layer whereas Celestia is its own full chain. This plus the reduced copies per node *should* provide better decentralization per cost. The most Ethereum aligned solution would be blob storage but EigenDA will offer a 10x cost reduction compared to that. At least for me, if I was an Ethereum rollup and I was offered two DA solutions of similar cost I'd probably choose the more Eth aligned one (otherwise why am I an Ethereum rollup?).\n\nCelestia's major play is to attempt to paradigm shift the ecosystem to an app-chain model. They need to convince everyone that they would rather have a sovereign rollup on Celestia than a smart contract rollup on Ethereum. From what I've seen of the Cosmos ecosystem, this is madness. App-chains explode the fragmentation problems of L2's and prevent atomic composability. Now instead of just approving each time I want to use a smart contract, I first have to bridge to where the app resides. I can't do something fancy like flash loans that would combine multiple applications into a single transaction unless all of those applications are on the same chain (which they won't be if every application has its own sovereign chain). I completely don't understand why the BellCurve hosts think Cosmos is more prepared for interop.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Summary of my thoughts from watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFMZp5ftnw8\">this recent BellCurve episode</a> on data availability.</p>\n\n<p>Data availability layers are critically important for scaling a rollup centric future.

Basically Gearbox is a leverage application that removes the leverage component from the underlying application and allows you to apply leverage using Defi legos on their own. Think of it like 'modular Defi'. The key insight that enabled leverage is that when you borrow funds, the funds aren't given to you, they are held in escrow by the protocol so you can't just run off with them. Now, there's no sense having the protocol just hold onto borrowed funds. The reason you're borrowing is to do *something*. So, since you aren't being given the funds the protocol has to do that something on your behalf.\n\nFor older leverage applications, the something they would do on your behalf *was* the application. You could use dydx and get leveraged price exposure to an asset but the leverage was tightly coupled to a dex. This leads to liquidity fragmentation. While the nature of the price exposure mechanism changed with apps like GMX, perps still tightly couple the liquidity source for leverage with their application. By contrast, Gearbox allows you to execute leveraged strategies that actually execute against Curve or Uniswap.\n\nTo execute a strategy with Gearbox you put up your collateral, borrow the funds required to execute your strategy, and then execute it using a plugin to any Defi application they support. For example if you wanted to go 3x long, you could put up 1x collateral, borrow 3x whatever you're shorting, swap to 3x of your long asset using any supported Dex, and hold that position while paying interest on the borrow. When plugged into something like Aave this also let's you do fancy stuff like profit from [interest rate spreads](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harvesting-interest-rate-spreads) or leverage your way into a Curve LP Yearn pool which auto compounds rewards back to you. The potential here is open ended and incredible.\n\nGearbox v3 does a few cool things. First it allows borrowers to have better granularity on which position is secured by which collateral. The basic idea is they create a smart contract with your name on it that is executed according to a strategy you configure. Second it enables lenders to underwrite their own risk and choose what types of risk their funds are exposed to. This is a common trend I've seen lately in Defi. We are steadily moving away from pooling everyone into the same risk bracket and moving towards programmable money where everyone can adjust their own risk.\n\nIf you have time I'd suggest you [dig in](https://blog.gearbox.fi/building-and-expanding-the-onchain-credit-layer/) or you know, [try it yourself](https://app.gearbox.fi/).

Bonus points here if you're an accredited investor and you can buy into the grift early before the retail investors (you're going to need them later!).\n\n3. Buy the narrative. It doesn't really matter what the narrative is: \"faster than bitcoin\", \"cheaper smart contracts\", \"tons of partnerships\", \"a new banking system\", \"Visa-level capacity\". Whatever. It doesn't matter what the grift is as long as you know it. The BEST grifts include promises of future activity and \"unlocks\".\n\n4. Shill like your life depends on it. This is where you REALLY earn your money. Just like any ponzi, you'll need to convince EVERYONE to buy into the grift because you need the price to go up and you need tons of exit liquidity so you don't get dumped on. You'll need to tap into all the socials you can, and even better if you can get podcast/youtube hits. Use whatever tactics work for you: education, insight, sarcasm, humor.. it doesn't matter.

With enough social activity, the flywheel will eventually kick in. This means that the price will go parabolic because the social work has made everyone aware of the grift, and when they see price movement they'll have fomo and buy in. The MOMENT the flywheel effect kicks in you've GOT to be on your toes to prepare your exit. THIS is where retail investors are critical.

This is the game of chicken: you need to dump BEFORE everyone else does. This is pretty easy, take 10x and get the hell out of there - no one wants to be left holding this worthless shit.

The crash will come, but you'll have made a fuckton of money and you're sitting pretty, but you CAN'T stop now! if you only survive one grift you'll die poor. The crash requires a lot of continued social activity to SIMULTANEOUSLY convince all of your followers that you were duped just like them, but ALSO that you made a ton of money.

This is harder if the grift had promises of future activity, but those are really sweet because you&#39;ll make a LOT more money on it. Most grifters will take a month off before spending another six month cycle pumping the next grift. In that month off, they&#39;ll re-establish their credibility by promoting solid assets like Ether. So, I mean, grifters really are good folks after all, right?</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-21 17:35:12","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-12-21 17:45:47","id":"keen5d7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18nfxvo","parent_id":"t3_18nfxvo","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/etherbie","body":"wen phizcoin?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>wen phizcoin?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-21 17:46:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"keeoscn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18nfxvo","parent_id":"t1_keen5d7","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/strawdar","body":"i think phiz needs to go hat shopping $PHIZWIFHAT","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>i think phiz needs to go hat shopping $PHIZWIFHAT</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-21 18:45:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"keex1fk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18nfxvo","parent_id":"t1_keeoscn","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"It's called ETH. u/superphiz has been shilling it and its associated values for far too long. u/evilphiz is the real phiz, he doesn't shill shit.\n\n^^/s","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s called ETH. <a href=\"/u/superphiz\">u/superphiz</a> has been shilling it and its associated values for far too long. <a href=\"/u/evilphiz\">u/evilphiz</a> is the real phiz, he doesn&#39;t shill shit.</p>\n\n<p><sup><sup>/s</sup></sup></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-22 02:04:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"keg42c8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18nfxvo","parent_id":"t1_keeoscn","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/etherbie","body":"Sounds sketchy","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sounds sketchy</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-22 02:25:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"keg5m83","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18nfxvo","parent_id":"t1_keg42c8","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/1l0o","body":"As much as I hate to admit it, there is a certain skill these folks possess.

This ties in with the point above about algorithms. Only the people in high places at these companies truly knows how their match-making process works under the hood. This caters to an environment of corruption and exploitation. And the companies don't want you to know how their algorithms work because, if revealed, it would make them look bad and put them under further scrutiny.\n* Pay-to-play. Look no further than Tinder's new, ridiculous $500 per month subscription option. Yes, I had to look and make sure this was actually a real thing. Sure, the pay-to-play model has it's place; the problem is that it has been adopted as the *ONLY* model for participants of OLD. The average user who doesn't participate in pay-to-play schemes is left in the dust with little to no matches to show for their time invested in OLD. This is a huge issue and leads me to my next point...\n*  No flexibility. Pay-to-play has injected itself into every facet of dating apps - from limiting simple quality of life profile settings, artificially suppressing profile visibility, how often you're allowed to swipe, what location you're allowed to swipe on, to hiding profiles of users who've liked you. Who wants arbitrary restrictions imposed on their OLD experience? Nobody.\n* Identity verification. The chances of coming across a real user's profile are becoming ever more slim in OLD. Bots, catfishers, scam artists, advertisers, influencers running self-promoting accounts...  Unmonitored accounts that have no intention of meeting someone in real life off of a dating app are prolific and only getting worse. This creates massive clutter that genuine users have to spend extra time wading through to filter through all the white noise, which has effectively bastardized the OLD scene. Identity verification, if present at all, is usually an optional feature and/or an afterthought that is poorly implemented. \n* Identity protection and privacy. OLD is kind of a double-edged sword in this regard, as in order to participate in OLD a person has to offer up at least a little bit of information about themselves.  Disingenuous individuals are becoming ever more clever with ways they can game the system and take advantage of participants of OLD. There are countless horror stories out there.

But why just stop at \"fixing\" OLD? I believe there is still plenty of innovation and untapped potential for the OLD community that can be fostered on a decentralized platform.\n\nTl;dr - People are becoming increasingly frustrated with the online dating scene, with many choosing to opt out of online dating entirely until a better user experience comes along.
