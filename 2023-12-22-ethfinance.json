I wanted to run an OBOL validator because I&#39;m excited about the idea of &quot;pure&quot; squad staking. A couple of friends want to get together and run a validator? OBOL is ideal. I wanted to support the jumpstart of community squad staking because I know OBOL will primarily be pushed to enterprise customers.. but there&#39;s a HUGE use case for a bunch of people who just want to split a validator.</p>\n\n<p>Diva is my real pie in the sky at the moment - I expect it to add huge opportunities for home stakers to stake with a bunch of people and earn extra rewards with as little as 1 Ether. Diva (along with Rocket Pool upgrades through Saturn) should finally give us the home staker capacity people have been begging for. Staking will be within the technical grasp of anyone who&#39;s willing to give up a Saturday, and anyone who has an Ether can stake from home.
