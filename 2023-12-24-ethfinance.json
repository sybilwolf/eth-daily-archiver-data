A world where Arbitrum/Optimism/ZKsync/etc is as cheap as Solana is a level playing field at attracting normies, memes, whatever. New L2s will create new opportunities for airdrops and new apps that take off. \n* **A potential ETH ETF** will create a speculative demand for ETH like nothing else. Even if it doesn\u2019t go through people will buy in anticipation \n* **Restaking** is the most under-discussed catalyst for ETH the asset. Not only will you have a deflationary asset with native yields, but potentially with ponzy-like yields. If ETH approaches even close to 20% yield from restaking at any point the demand will be massive.
