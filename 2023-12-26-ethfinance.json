Asking as I'm still relatively new to this and want to improve when I can - don't be shy or holdback anything in feedback. For some context, my goal has largely been to take on these roles to help get some of the great minds on r/ethfinance a way to feel represented in governance. I'm not sure that has happened to the extent I've envisioned, but hopefully I'm making *some* impact and will grow into that in the future. \n\nObviously, I have no way to tell who actually delegates to me, but I'm assuming a bulk of the people are those who post here. So figured this was the best place to ask. So in short, do let me know if there are things you think I can improve on or ways you felt I've let you down. As well as things I've done that you would like to see me keep doing. Even if you aren't specifically a delegate to me.\n\nSome thoughts / questions of my own:\n\nVoting Transparency --- I do try to post DAO updates here both for informational purposes and to keep myself transparent. I know following actually Tally / Snapshot votes is a pain, so I hope this helps. Unfortunately, ARB is a little difficult since the forum links are shadow-banned. I do try to comment in the Arbitrum / HOP forums on my votes where it feels warranted (or on the actual Snapshot votes themselves). No good way around the ARB problem, but I do link the votes and do a summary of decision here to help with that. I also try to wait until a few votes have passed to 'batch' my updates and avoid clogging up the daily toooo much, however if people would prefer immediate updates (say, within a few days of the vote ending) I can switch to that. \n\nVoting Participation --- I do try to vote on everything that comes up, since that is ultimately the fundamental role here. Regrettably, I did miss a few votes over my time doing this. I think about 5 or 6 overall earlier in the summer across both DAOs. No excuses, and I've made sure not to miss stuff going forward. I'll add, the Arbitrum STIP voting I did probably vote in maybe 1/4th of the total pool of candidates. The structure was a major issue IMO, which I brought up in the DAO forums. Expecting delegates to vet and vote on 100+ projects in that timeframe was impossible, and it does sound like future STIP / LTIPs are making note of that. And I'm not sure many delegates did vote in 100% of those (hats off to those who did). Sort of a one-off, but wanted to clarify that situation, and I do wish in hindsight I took a little more time for that.\n\nCalls --- I do try to attend the ARB and HOP calls when I can. I work full time, so it's as schedule permits (although ARB does record the call and HOP has notes). ARB I've been admittedly lacking, but I've been better having joined the last 2. This is one of my top goals, to have better attendance here. My Q here is this - do people want updates on this type of thing? Is that too much? It sort of goes along the lines of r/ethfinance input as I'll discuss below. \n\nr/Ethfinance Input --- I know sort of the point of being a delegate is so that people don't have to worry about day to day minutia. However, I do want to feel out people's opinion on this. For notable / larger / more controversial topics should I try to reach out for input more? Do people rather just me 'read the room' and vote that way. I try to vote in a way that is best for the particular DAOs & the Ethereum chain, but again I want to leverage the mindshare that is here to do that as I am still only human. Also, I want to re-iterate that I welcome people to reach out. that doesn't happen much, so if there are ways people think I can be more inviting, for a lack of a better word, let me know. I'd love to be able to be a bridge between ideas here and ultimately discussion in front of said DAOS. \n\nUpdates --- Basically, a mis-mash of the above. I want to walk the line as best I can between over and under updating on issues. So thoughts on this would be appreciated!\n\nTwitter --- I don't really like Twitter, but I made one as I can't stick my head in the sand. I don't really use it that much... I'd be curious to those who think if I should use it more? I'm thinking maybe just doing updates there as well for those who follow. I don't want to dive into CT degeneracy, but I probably should use it as a space to get updates out?\n\nAnd finally, a thank you! There isn't a day that goes by where I'm not aware of the number of people that trust me with this. I know governance isn't that sexy of a thing, but it's really cool that people feel they can trust their vote with me and that isn't lost.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In the spirit of year-end reflection and New Year&#39;s resolutions, I am looking for feedback / suggestions regarding my delegating duties of ARB and HOP I&#39;ve taken on this year.

I&#39;ve noticed frequent updates here and on the forum, and you provide rationale before casting your vote, which is not very common in DAO. Mostly, I have seen delegates rubber-stamping proposals put forward by the DAO, simply because most don&#39;t have either the interest or the time to read and understand the proposals.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t have anything to suggest; I am still learning from this community. One thing I would like to point out: once you dig deeper and understand the DAO, its projects, active members, both the good and the bad, focus only on the good. It&#39;s not worth fighting the online keyboard warriors; they will try to drag you down, remember that this space is mostly filled with greedy people trying to game the system, including DAO.</p>\n\n<p>Mental health is above all.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-26 16:22:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kf226jd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18r1c9q","parent_id":"t1_kezzi27","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":">Mental health is above all.\n\nSo true, with anything in the space really!\n\nAppreciate the kind words and advice!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Mental health is above all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So true, with anything in the space really!</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate the kind words and advice!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-26 20:04:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kf2w1zg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18r1c9q","parent_id":"t1_kf226jd","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/etherbie","body":"Oh my god.
