By chance (I don't even remember how) I found an online poker school that handed out 50$ for free after passing a quiz. I started playing Fixed Limit on the low low stakes (well, because 50$ isn't a lot) but learned a lot, became better, moved up. When I reached 5/10$ (still in FL), I couldn't handle the daily swings anymore. After all I was still a student, had like 750$ a month for everything from rent to food to cloths to drinks. So being in a position of losing 1000$+ on any given day, basically within 30 mins was too much for me. I played 3/6$ for a long time, switched to NL at some point and made it to NL200 games, but felt uncomfy again. I think I was a decent player (but nowhere near the best players on the high stakes) and could have moved higher with my bankroll and skill, but never did. I met a lot of high stakes players that made a lot of money (e.g. I am pretty sure I talked to Hasu a few times). A lot of friends made a lot of money just playing mid stakes, not even grinding nose bleeds. Later I lost interest, because I started working and didn't want to grind at day and night. \n\nAs my second job, I joined a startup rather early, just after they had secured the first significant funding. The startup had created a new product, which turned out to be very successful, used the funding to do performance marketing and within 3 years, the company grew from basically 100 to 1000 FTE. A lot of \"high profile\" people were hired, earning a lot more than I did, despite being assholes, not being a cultural fit and also not delivering any meaningful results. But they were great politically, knew what to say, when to say it and how to impress the (also rather young) founders. I was living the culture, delivering, but earned like 50% and hated everything about the bullshit bingo guys. \n\nWhen a very good friend of mine quit his job, he still had some free time before his new gig started and he asked me what to do with it. That was at the end of 2017/ beginning of 2018. I said \"there's this crypto thingy, seems to be interesting, maybe dive it?\". We decided to invest 1000$ together. I was still very risk averse and didn't feel comfortable putting money into something that went up and down so fast, so I was happy we did it together. We bought the literal top in January 2018. Got like 0.7X ETH on a Friday, which made +100$ until Saturday. I still remember the euphoria, that day marked the literal pico top of the cycle. I learned a lot, eventually started living on-chain, but never really participated in farming, cause I still dislike spending ETH for tx I don't really need to do for a potential airdrop I might or might not receive. I did receive a lot of airdrops, but I am also pretty sure that compared to others here, my airdrops are tiny. \n\nAlso I had a neteller credit card connected to my Amazon account and basically ordered stuff for free as a student and bought a new (small) car just after finishing university, because I had made 50k in online poker. \n\nWhile I was \"only\" earning 50% of the supposedly high flyers, my salary 2,5xed within 3 years and I had way more money than I needed (and you are probably aware by now, that spending / investing money is not a strength). I also started as a senior role, but at one point managed 150 people and three departments. \n\nWhile I probably should have invested more, invested earlier, farmed more and should have way more ETH than I have now, I have received a decent amount or airdrops that are a huge boost to my portfolio. More importantly, I have learned a lot, about investing, finance, how poorly I invested before, how many basic concepts I didn't fully understand and how important it is to make conscious financial decisions. \n\nDon't compare yourself to the guys that make more money in poker, at work or in crypto. Compare yourself to the guy in the mirror that wouldn't have played poker, wasn't lucky to join a growing startup that allowed you to grow a lot in a short amount of time (both financially, but also when it comes to responsibilities and hence your CV), or wouldn't have invested in crypto because that friend you needed would have said \"no\". \n\nIf there is one thing that I have learned it's that comparing usually won't help you. It usually doesn't motivate. It actually kills motivation. It gives you a hard time emotionally. Don't compare yourself to the guy on twitter that brags with that 7digit PnL. Don't blame yourself for not receiving the next airdrop on 5 wallets instead of one. \n\nComparing doesn't make sense, because your risk appetite is unique. If you accept that you are defined by who/ how you are, you will be able to accept outcomes way better. We can't expect to make millions if we don't invest a lot (of time, money, ETH). And that's okay! \n\nCelebrate that one airdrop like it was the lottery. Be happy about your first ETH like it was worth a million. Don't try to be/ act different then you truly are.

Mods, appreciate if you could approve this post.\n\nI'm hoping that someone is able to help. Having a bit of a stressful time.\n\nI'm attempting to change withdrawal credentials for my validators from the BLS address to an eth1 withdrawal address. I'm following SomerEsat's guide [here](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-configuring-withdrawal-credentials-on-ethereum-812dce3193a).\n\nThe guide seems to assume that the BLS withdrawal address will be different for each validator. However, for the 4 validators I created, the BLS withdrawal address is the same.\n\nMy memory is a little hazy how these validates were originally created. But I believe that I used the cli tool and used the existing-mnemonic flag. And I used the same mnemonic that is used for my ledger nano hardware wallet. These validators are also being run through Stakefish. I believe that they were all created together in a single script run, but it's possible it was done four times. \n\nIf I attempt to run the new credentials-change script (on an air gapped machine) and input my four validator index numbers, set the index position to 0 and repeat the same BLS address four times, I get an error 'The given withdrawal credentials does not match the old BLS withdrawal credentials that mnemonic generated'.\n\nHowever, if I run the script four times, once each for the four validator index numbers and each time using an Index Position of 0, I am able to successfully create four JSON files.\n\nI am unsure if these four JSON files will be okay to broadcast to the beaconchain and will work fine. Or if I've unintentionally screwed this up from the very beginning.\n\nAny advice/reassurance would be appreciated!\n\nShould I be doing anything differently? \n\nIt's late in my timezone, so I'll be going to sleep to try and rest. I'll respond to all messages in the morning.\n\nEdit:\n\nOkay, woke up after an (admittedly terrible) night's sleep. Thank you to SuperPhiz and BaggyGravy. Your responses were really helpful.\n\ntl;dr I've successfully updated the eth1 withdrawal keys for my validators. \n\nLong version:\nI went back and looked through the original Stakefish Docs. There was a clue here in the confuguration that read: Number of Validators: Input 1 (this value doesn't matter when using the stakefish validating service). Which confirmed for me that I hadn't made an error when setting up the keys.\n\nI also stumbled across an old reddit thread for the same stakefish issue. u/Nullius_123 had confidently stated 'Do them one at a time. It worked for me.'\n\nWith that knowledge, I had enough confidence to proceed with creating and broadcasting seperate json files for each validator.\n\nOn Phiz's advice, I also used the Wagyu tool. I created a test json using this tool and compared to the CLI tool. They were exactly the same. Which gave me further confidence.\n\nI broadcast the json messages using Stakefish's interface (this seemed like a better bet than using beachoncha.in.\n\nAs of now, I can see that the withdrawal change has been validated and pointing at my Eth1 address.\n\nIn hindsight, had I blindly trusted the Stakefish instructions, I would have arrived at the same result. Although, stressful, I'm glad I thoroughly researched the whole process to gain confidence it was all going to work. Hopefully this message can be useful for anyone going through the same process.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, throwaway account just because discussing a large amount of money.

However, for the 4 validators I created, the BLS withdrawal address is the same.</p>\n\n<p>My memory is a little hazy how these validates were originally created. But I believe that I used the cli tool and used the existing-mnemonic flag. And I used the same mnemonic that is used for my ledger nano hardware wallet. These validators are also being run through Stakefish. I believe that they were all created together in a single script run, but it&#39;s possible it was done four times. </p>\n\n<p>If I attempt to run the new credentials-change script (on an air gapped machine) and input my four validator index numbers, set the index position to 0 and repeat the same BLS address four times, I get an error &#39;The given withdrawal credentials does not match the old BLS withdrawal credentials that mnemonic generated&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>However, if I run the script four times, once each for the four validator index numbers and each time using an Index Position of 0, I am able to successfully create four JSON files.</p>\n\n<p>I am unsure if these four JSON files will be okay to broadcast to the beaconchain and will work fine. Or if I&#39;ve unintentionally screwed this up from the very beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice/reassurance would be appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Should I be doing anything differently? </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s late in my timezone, so I&#39;ll be going to sleep to try and rest. I&#39;ll respond to all messages in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>Okay, woke up after an (admittedly terrible) night&#39;s sleep. Thank you to SuperPhiz and BaggyGravy. Your responses were really helpful.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr I&#39;ve successfully updated the eth1 withdrawal keys for my validators. </p>\n\n<p>Long version:\nI went back and looked through the original Stakefish Docs. There was a clue here in the confuguration that read: Number of Validators: Input 1 (this value doesn&#39;t matter when using the stakefish validating service). Which confirmed for me that I hadn&#39;t made an error when setting up the keys.</p>\n\n<p>I also stumbled across an old reddit thread for the same stakefish issue. <a href=\"/u/Nullius_123\">u/Nullius_123</a> had confidently stated &#39;Do them one at a time. It worked for me.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>With that knowledge, I had enough confidence to proceed with creating and broadcasting seperate json files for each validator.</p>\n\n<p>On Phiz&#39;s advice, I also used the Wagyu tool. I created a test json using this tool and compared to the CLI tool. They were exactly the same. Which gave me further confidence.</p>\n\n<p>I broadcast the json messages using Stakefish&#39;s interface (this seemed like a better bet than using beachoncha.in.</p>\n\n<p>As of now, I can see that the withdrawal change has been validated and pointing at my Eth1 address.</p>\n\n<p>In hindsight, had I blindly trusted the Stakefish instructions, I would have arrived at the same result. Although, stressful, I&#39;m glad I thoroughly researched the whole process to gain confidence it was all going to work. Hopefully this message can be useful for anyone going through the same process.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-27 03:46:02","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-12-27 13:08:42","id":"kf41ays","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18rth8u","parent_id":"t3_18rth8u","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"It has been awhile since I've thought about this, but the index refers to the validator you're creating..
