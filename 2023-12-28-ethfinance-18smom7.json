They use minority clients: Lighthouse and Nethermind. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Best solution for leftover amounts when you&#39;ve staked all your 32-ETH blocks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Competition in staking is heating up daily (e.g. with DVT solutions coming online), but I&#39;ll nominate StakeWise v3. You can stake any amount and don&#39;t need to get an LST. You get to choose an operator. Perhaps 5% fees are typical, but I see one offering 1%. Serenita is a high performing operator and runs minority clients. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Some reasons you might want to use SAAS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t want LSTs because you&#39;d have to generate a capital gain when selling ETH for them; and they have high fees, typically 10% for Lido&#39;s stETH. </p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t want to solo stake because you may not feel technically competent enough; you may have unreliable internet (or limited capacity) or electricity; or you may not have a stable place for your node (e.g. you&#39;re a digital nomad).</p>\n\n<p>** 2/25 assumptions: $2694K ETH. 3.1% yield on Advanced plan. 3.21% yield on Enterprise plan. Breakeven ETH price for Enterprise plan: $2718.5. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Archive:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Blox Staking</strong></p>\n\n<p>They have a 0% fee forever (not a typo). Their effectiveness rating on Rated Network is below the 50th percentile as I write this. The company behind them is probably more focused on their new SSV Network now. I noticed that their website gets barely any traffic anymore (it ranks in the millions), but Rated Network says they still stake about 0.53% of staked ether, and they have an active Discord. They use mostly Prysm (the most popular consensus client). </p>\n\n<p>Update, 3/24: they&#39;re shutting down (<a href=\"https://www.bloxstaking.com/blog/product-updates/bloxstaking-moving-to-new-horizons/\">announcement</a>, <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/1bdcf7b/fyi_bloxstaking_is_shutting_down/\">reddit discussion</a>).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-28 11:53:10","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-02-15 15:53:28","id":"kfb6edi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18smom7","parent_id":"t3_18smom7","score":39,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Kukai_walker","body":"Nice summary!
