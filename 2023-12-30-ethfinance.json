To me, btc has always seemed more like religion than anything else.\n\nIt wasn't until I starting reading about Ethereum that I saw the value in the underpinnings of this new religion. Blockchains, when well designed and implemented, allow people to interact/transact without centralized actors. \n\nPeople get more done when they work together and the history of human progress is in my opinion the history of humans learning how to cooperate more and kill each other less. Unfortunately, working together usually means giving power to a small group of people that oversee things and are given a mandate to make choices on behalf of others. These centralized actors all too often become corrupted, and the biggest man-made disasters would never be possible without a bunch of centralized actors abusing or misusing their power (\"lol lets go kill all the sparrows\").\n\nEthereum obviously is not going to solve the problem of centralized power on its own, but it is one of the few developments that I have seen during my life that allow for improved cooperation without increased centralization. To me, that's big and that's worth sticking around for. \n\nIt is unfortunately also why I haven't been as bearish about Ethereum in the past as I am now. A few years ago the question was \"How do we implement this new tool in a credibly neutral way?\", a technical question with a *relatively* easily definable answer. Now the question seems to be \"Do we really care about decentralization/credible neutrality or do we just want memecoins?\". To me (and I suspect most others here) the answer is clear but we have some convincing to do in the broader community. \n\nSo I believe in Ethereum's credible neutrality.
