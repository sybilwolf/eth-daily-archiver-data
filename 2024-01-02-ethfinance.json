Obviously the state of staking will be something to watch this year. A lot of people expect way more ETH staked, especially *if* there is an ETH ETF and it is allowed to stake the underlying ETH. Lido dominance will be something to have an eye on. Then there is eigenlayer of course... And maybe if there are some solo staker airdrops, we will also see new inflows from \"small guys\". So let's dive in! \n\n**Validator overview - total: 1051685 validators\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 901635 active (December: 881447; +20188 / +2,2%, | May: 554322; +347313 / +62%)\n* 384 pending (December: 388; -4 / -1% | May: 15537; -15153 / -97,5%)\n* 0 exiting (December: 722; 0 / -100% | May: 7333; -7333 / -100%)\n* 205331 exited (December: 169613; +35718 / +21% | May: 39341; +165990 / +422%)\n\nThe validator set keeps on growing. The growth isn't crazy and there are also continuous exits every month, but generally speaking number go up. Right now we are at 24,2% of all ETH staked. In my opinion, there's nothing really \"fancy\" to see here. \n\n  \n**Client diversity numbers\\*\\***  \n*Consensus*\n\n* Prysm 41% (December: 41%, May: 38%)\n* Lighthouse 33% (December: 34%, May: 37%)\n* Teku 16% (December: 16%, May: 17%)\n* Nimbus 8% (December: 7%, May: 6%)\n* Lodestar 1% (December: 1%, May: 1%)\n\n*Execution*\n\n* Geth 84% (December: 84%)\n* Nethermind 8% (December: 8%)\n* Erigon 2% (December: 2%)\n* Besu 5% (December: 5%)\n\nClient diversity is more or less the same it was at the end of last year. Nimbus slightly gaining share, which is good, but not really important, since Consensus clients are looking okay.   \nExecution keeps on being an issue. Geth's share with a constant 84% is still way too high. How can we change that? \n\n1. Switch from Geth to a minority client. It *really* isn't that hard and might have other benefits like a better feature set (e.g. auto pruning), which might help to make a decision. \n2. There is e.g. [Arbora.eth](https://x.com/arboraeth/status/1741947346206826699?s=20) on Twitter asking Coinbase to stop using Geth as their sole execution client. Join them, retweet, post, pressure bigger entities to change their setup. I think retweeting is rather low effort, but might help to spread the word. \n\n  \n**Pool distribution\\*\\*\\***\n\n* Lido 31,7% (December: 32,3%)\n* Coinbase 14,3% (December: 14,2%)\n* Binance 3,7% (December: 4,1%)\n* Rocket Pool 2,9% (December: 2,9%)\n* Kraken 2,8% (December: 2,7%)  \n\\+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc.\n\nWith the launch of Blast Lido was gaining market share last month. This has stopped and interestingly Lido is basically back to 31,x% like before the launch. Now obviously we can't really tell where it would be without Blast, but my guess is lower and in a best case the launch only pushed it up temporarily and market share will continue to fall. \n\nObviously we should not rely on the market handling it! If you have (w)stETH please think about withdrawing from Lido and/ or depositing into Diva. If you participate in the \"Diva vampire attack\" you will not only receive a new LST but also Diva tokens. Interestingly Diva already has 0.4% market share and hasn't even launched yet.

Obviously the state of staking will be something to watch this year. A lot of people expect way more ETH staked, especially <em>if</em> there is an ETH ETF and it is allowed to stake the underlying ETH. Lido dominance will be something to have an eye on. Then there is eigenlayer of course... And maybe if there are some solo staker airdrops, we will also see new inflows from &quot;small guys&quot;. So let&#39;s dive in! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Validator overview - total: 1051685 validators\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>901635 active (December: 881447; +20188 / +2,2%, | May: 554322; +347313 / +62%)</li>\n<li>384 pending (December: 388; -4 / -1% | May: 15537; -15153 / -97,5%)</li>\n<li>0 exiting (December: 722; 0 / -100% | May: 7333; -7333 / -100%)</li>\n<li>205331 exited (December: 169613; +35718 / +21% | May: 39341; +165990 / +422%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The validator set keeps on growing. The growth isn&#39;t crazy and there are also continuous exits every month, but generally speaking number go up. Right now we are at 24,2% of all ETH staked. In my opinion, there&#39;s nothing really &quot;fancy&quot; to see here. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Client diversity numbers*\\</strong>*<br/>\n<em>Consensus</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Prysm 41% (December: 41%, May: 38%)</li>\n<li>Lighthouse 33% (December: 34%, May: 37%)</li>\n<li>Teku 16% (December: 16%, May: 17%)</li>\n<li>Nimbus 8% (December: 7%, May: 6%)</li>\n<li>Lodestar 1% (December: 1%, May: 1%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Execution</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Geth 84% (December: 84%)</li>\n<li>Nethermind 8% (December: 8%)</li>\n<li>Erigon 2% (December: 2%)</li>\n<li>Besu 5% (December: 5%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Client diversity is more or less the same it was at the end of last year. Nimbus slightly gaining share, which is good, but not really important, since Consensus clients are looking okay.<br/>\nExecution keeps on being an issue. Geth&#39;s share with a constant 84% is still way too high. How can we change that? </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Switch from Geth to a minority client. It <em>really</em> isn&#39;t that hard and might have other benefits like a better feature set (e.g. auto pruning), which might help to make a decision. </li>\n<li>There is e.g. <a href=\"https://x.com/arboraeth/status/1741947346206826699?s=20\">Arbora.eth</a> on Twitter asking Coinbase to stop using Geth as their sole execution client. Join them, retweet, post, pressure bigger entities to change their setup. I think retweeting is rather low effort, but might help to spread the word. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Pool distribution**\\</strong>*</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lido 31,7% (December: 32,3%)</li>\n<li>Coinbase 14,3% (December: 14,2%)</li>\n<li>Binance 3,7% (December: 4,1%)</li>\n<li>Rocket Pool 2,9% (December: 2,9%)</li>\n<li>Kraken 2,8% (December: 2,7%)<br/>\n+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With the launch of Blast Lido was gaining market share last month. This has stopped and interestingly Lido is basically back to 31,x% like before the launch. Now obviously we can&#39;t really tell where it would be without Blast, but my guess is lower and in a best case the launch only pushed it up temporarily and market share will continue to fall. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously we should not rely on the market handling it! If you have (w)stETH please think about withdrawing from Lido and/ or depositing into Diva. If you participate in the &quot;Diva vampire attack&quot; you will not only receive a new LST but also Diva tokens. Interestingly Diva already has 0.4% market share and hasn&#39;t even launched yet.
