First off, while I find Sreeram to be a smart guy with genuine insights, listening to him is difficult. I literally wrote this whole thing just so I was sure I was capturing what he was saying otherwise I found myself zoning out again and again. They could use a better spokesman. This got long enough I'll have to break it into two parts, the first part will be on EigenLayer and the second will be on EigenDA. If you want a primer on restaking itself, I suggest starting [here](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/restaking).\n\nEigenLayer first enabled deposits in June this year. They're doing a guarded launch with deposit caps. The last cap raise was in December and I believe it just filled yesterday or the day before (you can still deposit straight ETH just got LST's). EigenDA is live on their public testnet. EigenLayer + EigenDA will be going to mainnet between Q1 and Q2 depending on audits.\n\nWhen you join EigenLayer as a native staker you have to set the withdrawal credentials to the EigenLayer platform. If you're using an LST your deposit practically does this as well, they just have to withdraw that LST to get the ETH. Either way they control the ETH and they have a 1 week withdrawal delay for safety which allows them to freeze the pod and potentially slash anyone they need to. This part is still very centralized but they plan to decentralize it over time.\n\nEigenLayer is permissionless so anyone can come and write their own AVS (Actively Validated Service). EigenLayer has programmable staking conditions which allows it to accept restaking with other assets like some type of on-chain treasury bill and it has programmable slashing conditions which each AVS can specify. Each AVS will be able to decide what collaterals they accept, limits on them, etc. All the smart contracts for EigenLayer are doing is implementing this delegated logic and slashing people's ownership of their stake using data of off-chain committees.\n\nThe reasons they focused on ETH first for collateral are the people validating for Ethereum were already doing a similar job to validating some other network so there was likely to be a large customer overlap there and that they expect many of the AVS to be Ethereum adjacent services so it makes more sense for the economic security of those services to be denominated in ETH without adding unnecessary trust assumptions for a company like Circle or another blockchain.\n\nSreeram argues that rehypothecation leverage-based mental models don't map well to EigenLayer because the risks are under the full control of the operator. This is different from typical leverage risks related to price volatility. The only additional risk comes when a node operator is performing a (slashable) service using collateral that isn't theirs so the node operator has nothing at stake. Other than admitting this is a problem Sreeram doesn't have much to add here other than to say that some other form of trust will need to be established between the node operator and restaker. He talks a bit about using trusted execution environments and an 'anti-slasher' project called Cubist that I'll have to look into later. I don't exactly like this answer but if the system is programmable enough maybe they could add collateral rules like Rocketpool has on the node operator side or maybe the node operators could provide proof of insurance or something.\n\nThe other type of risk they address are economic risks from restaking such as if the demand for staked ETH was increased significantly and restaking became necessary just to be economically viable. Obviously restaking will necessitate higher hardware requirements which is something Ethereum has worked hard to avoid for decentralization purposes. Sreeram argues that anything you can do with EigenLayer you could do with an LST. Lido for example could just decide that all their node operators must also have to serve as validators for some other system (which Lido may entirely own). Having this secondary source of income would presumably increase the APR for stETH holders and further solidify their position as the dominant LST. EigenLayer is an improvement in this regard because it's a neutral platform and it's attempting to democratize access to these opportunities and make it as transparent, formal, and verifiable as they can.\n\nSreeram also argues that the delegation rules of EigenLayer are flexible enough to allow each AVS to add custom rules about which node operators they accept, which collateral they accept, and how the rewards for validation are distributed. So, AVS which value decentralization can create rules that favor decentralization. You could have an AVS exclude stETH as a collateral, exclude Lido node operators, or use something like Witness chain which offers a geographical location oracle for each operator and distribute more of the yield to operators in rarer jurisdictions. If we want decentralization we should work to build up decentralization oracles these AVS can use and then use layer zero to compel them to use them.\n\nMy commentary on this is more that restaking can't be stopped whether you like it or not so I think I'd prefer having it arbitrated using an Ethereum smart contract as much as possible rather than various off-chain processes between the Lido DAO and their node operators for example. I think over time the cost of validating these services will converge with the IT and ops costs of actually running the system so being restaking node operator just becomes the full time job of running a high-availability data center and patching all the software on hundreds of machines. There is an economy of scale here that will push out smaller operators from restaking. Just as Bitcoin mining has consolidated to larger players, restaking will do the same thing to Ethereum operators.\n\nNow you might not like that, but what can you do about it? I once heard [Justin Drake talk](https://youtu.be/aP9f_1v9Ulc?si=rRBjw4HIt6YpabDb&t=2352) about how they could hard fork the network to fight restaking. While what he says is true, all that would do is force restaking back to off-chain processes like Sreeram is saying. Restaking is inevitable, it's transformative, and we'll all be better off frontrunning this opportunity and shaping it into the best thing it can be. Coming to an Ethereum mainnet near you Q1-Q2 2024.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s a recap of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms94dx9HvL0\">recent Bankless episode</a> for EigenLayer with Sreeram. First off, while I find Sreeram to be a smart guy with genuine insights, listening to him is difficult. I literally wrote this whole thing just so I was sure I was capturing what he was saying otherwise I found myself zoning out again and again. They could use a better spokesman. This got long enough I&#39;ll have to break it into two parts, the first part will be on EigenLayer and the second will be on EigenDA. If you want a primer on restaking itself, I suggest starting <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/restaking\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>EigenLayer first enabled deposits in June this year. They&#39;re doing a guarded launch with deposit caps. The last cap raise was in December and I believe it just filled yesterday or the day before (you can still deposit straight ETH just got LST&#39;s). EigenDA is live on their public testnet. EigenLayer + EigenDA will be going to mainnet between Q1 and Q2 depending on audits.</p>\n\n<p>When you join EigenLayer as a native staker you have to set the withdrawal credentials to the EigenLayer platform. If you&#39;re using an LST your deposit practically does this as well, they just have to withdraw that LST to get the ETH. Either way they control the ETH and they have a 1 week withdrawal delay for safety which allows them to freeze the pod and potentially slash anyone they need to. This part is still very centralized but they plan to decentralize it over time.</p>\n\n<p>EigenLayer is permissionless so anyone can come and write their own AVS (Actively Validated Service). EigenLayer has programmable staking conditions which allows it to accept restaking with other assets like some type of on-chain treasury bill and it has programmable slashing conditions which each AVS can specify. Each AVS will be able to decide what collaterals they accept, limits on them, etc. All the smart contracts for EigenLayer are doing is implementing this delegated logic and slashing people&#39;s ownership of their stake using data of off-chain committees.</p>\n\n<p>The reasons they focused on ETH first for collateral are the people validating for Ethereum were already doing a similar job to validating some other network so there was likely to be a large customer overlap there and that they expect many of the AVS to be Ethereum adjacent services so it makes more sense for the economic security of those services to be denominated in ETH without adding unnecessary trust assumptions for a company like Circle or another blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>Sreeram argues that rehypothecation leverage-based mental models don&#39;t map well to EigenLayer because the risks are under the full control of the operator. This is different from typical leverage risks related to price volatility. The only additional risk comes when a node operator is performing a (slashable) service using collateral that isn&#39;t theirs so the node operator has nothing at stake. Other than admitting this is a problem Sreeram doesn&#39;t have much to add here other than to say that some other form of trust will need to be established between the node operator and restaker. He talks a bit about using trusted execution environments and an &#39;anti-slasher&#39; project called Cubist that I&#39;ll have to look into later. I don&#39;t exactly like this answer but if the system is programmable enough maybe they could add collateral rules like Rocketpool has on the node operator side or maybe the node operators could provide proof of insurance or something.</p>\n\n<p>The other type of risk they address are economic risks from restaking such as if the demand for staked ETH was increased significantly and restaking became necessary just to be economically viable. Obviously restaking will necessitate higher hardware requirements which is something Ethereum has worked hard to avoid for decentralization purposes. Sreeram argues that anything you can do with EigenLayer you could do with an LST. Lido for example could just decide that all their node operators must also have to serve as validators for some other system (which Lido may entirely own). Having this secondary source of income would presumably increase the APR for stETH holders and further solidify their position as the dominant LST. EigenLayer is an improvement in this regard because it&#39;s a neutral platform and it&#39;s attempting to democratize access to these opportunities and make it as transparent, formal, and verifiable as they can.</p>\n\n<p>Sreeram also argues that the delegation rules of EigenLayer are flexible enough to allow each AVS to add custom rules about which node operators they accept, which collateral they accept, and how the rewards for validation are distributed. So, AVS which value decentralization can create rules that favor decentralization. You could have an AVS exclude stETH as a collateral, exclude Lido node operators, or use something like Witness chain which offers a geographical location oracle for each operator and distribute more of the yield to operators in rarer jurisdictions. If we want decentralization we should work to build up decentralization oracles these AVS can use and then use layer zero to compel them to use them.</p>\n\n<p>My commentary on this is more that restaking can&#39;t be stopped whether you like it or not so I think I&#39;d prefer having it arbitrated using an Ethereum smart contract as much as possible rather than various off-chain processes between the Lido DAO and their node operators for example. I think over time the cost of validating these services will converge with the IT and ops costs of actually running the system so being restaking node operator just becomes the full time job of running a high-availability data center and patching all the software on hundreds of machines. There is an economy of scale here that will push out smaller operators from restaking. Just as Bitcoin mining has consolidated to larger players, restaking will do the same thing to Ethereum operators.</p>\n\n<p>Now you might not like that, but what can you do about it?
