(Which is sadly ironic because at least one of those is tied very closely to the overarching security mechanism of PoS - another example of how we cannot simply \"code in\" all required incentives.)*\n\nHowever, for some stakers, namely solo-stakers (and possibly other smaller, more responsible staking entites), the situation is much less clear. I think it's fair to say that Geth is indeed a much(?) supererior client to the competition. Should, therefore, a solo-staker take on a more philanthropic role by worrying more about network health by say, running Besu - a less mature client - than their own immediate needs? In terms of measurable risk *for them* (as far as we can calculate) running Besu would seem to be a disadvantage. E.g. the probability of an event like yesterday for Besu (or NM?) is clearly higher, and their ability to recover from it expediently compared to a larger provider, probably much lower (hence larger losses in time, stress and income). Moreover, as stated at the outset, the systemic risk from the Geth super majority is *not* driven by solo stakers, and so solo stakers are not meaningfully mitigating that risk by avoiding Geth. (This is like the problem with global warming - we should all try our best, but in reality at this stage, due to the tragedy of the commons, the biggest, and possibly *only meaingful* improvements can be made by societal policy shift in law).\n\nSo, solo-stakers in particular have a question to answer. Should they willingly chose a client that is measureably poorer and riskier *for them*, basically in support of the \"greater good\"? Or do they stick with Geth, which is likely to be more reliable for them, and basically push the job of reducing the Geth majority onto the larger stakers (who are clearly much more culpable)? Ultimately, this is something of a subjective choice that boils down to estimates of risk, reliability and person attitude. Yes, Geth *could* fail in a catastrophic way, but Besu *did* fail in a catastrophic way. The (empirical) probabilities speak for themselves. Sadly, there is even a worse outcome here, in that (the short sighted) large stakers will now be extremely glad they were running Geth, and not Besu, because imagine having thouands of validators going down on a weekend, with no clear fix for ~24 hours. That would have been extremely costly. Bullet dodged.\n\nIn summary, if all clients were demonstrably equally reliabile, the choice of client and question of majority would be more straightforward. But they are not equal at the present time and pragmatism will prevail.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A few further thoughts and opinions on the Besu failure yesterday.
