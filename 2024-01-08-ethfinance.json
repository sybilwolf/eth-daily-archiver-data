But if you just want the answer, I will put a TL;DR at the end.\n\nSo my node is the one machine but with four SSD's. One for the OS, one for each of my nodes, and one as a spare (So I can restore things remotely if a disk dies). One has the Lighthouse-Nethermind pair and the other has the Teku-Besu pair, but it is all the one machine. Some of you may have noticed in that Github issue that I have Lighthouse VC pointed to Teku BN as a primary and not my Lighthouse BN, and I will address that soon.\n\nWhen I got that machine I had 3 SATA SSD's, one for the OS (Proxmox), one for Lighthouse, and the other for Besu. It was running *mostly* okay until the merge, when you actually needed an execution client. Up until then you didn't *need* one (I mean you wouldn't be able to propose blocks, but you could still attest fine). So I decided to change things up just before the merge, and I installed Nethermind with Lighthouse, and Teku with Besu, meaning now I have two full nodes, not just the one spread across two drives. So if either of those drives fail, or if any one of those clients corrupt I will still be online.\n\nExcept by doing so I introduced a big problem when it came to IOPS. My execution engine was always taking a long time to process blocks, which meant I was attesting quite poorly. It was fine when it was just the execution engine by itself, but as I was now running a consensus client on the same drive, it was struggling. Through some testing I had found that Besu worked better than Nethermind (As Nethermind is heavier on the disk IOPS) so I ended up making that my primary BN endpoint (Which answers that point from before).\n\nTo address the issue, I upgraded the sata SSD's to NVMe SSD's, but it barely even made a difference. I tried everything I could to optimise my setup and ensure I had the best IOPS I could get, making as many host OS and guest OS changes as I could, except my performance in the VM's was always 50% less than had I done the test directly to the disk from the OS. Some changes made *slight* differences, but nothing was enough. Meaning the issue was ... the hypervisor itself.\n\nI decided to use this as an opportunity to buy a second machine (And just install plain Debian on there, no hypervisor) which also fixes the problem of there being a single point of failure. \n\nNow my IOPS and my performance are wonderful, and up until now I have also been building blocks natively, and I decided why not try my luck with MEV, so I installed that on there too.\n\nWhich means my next task is to wipe that first machine and install Debian, no more hypervisor. Which means reinstalling everything again. Lighthouse, Nethermind, then syncing them, etc. So ...\n\n**TL;DR:** As I had planned to wipe that machine anyway, I figured there wasn't any point in installing MEV now, as I was going to do that when I rebuilt the machine at some point in the not too distant future.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You are right, it is <em>technically</em> available, but with the configuration that I had on there it wasn&#39;t.

To start with, it's an L2. They are seeking to 'combine the features of optimistic and ZK roll ups', whatever the hell that means. On the tokenomics side, it's unique in that using it will give kickbacks to devs. You'll earn points that are eventually redeemable for veFXS (a revenue earning token that is locked for several years) for deploying contracts and using gas. This converts any protocol that deploys and drives adoption on their chain to become long-term partners with the Frax DAO. That's probably a more sustainable model than Arbitrum STIPs but it's more convoluted than like a 30% APR yield baked into a Defi position like [MIM on Arbitrum right now](https://app.beefy.finance/vault/spell-mim-crv) (yes, that's actually a thing). Basically they are targeting the dev side and finding ways to profit from the chain users.\n\nOn the user end, they are trying to add to their frxETH flywheel. Their L2 will use frxETH for gas, which basically is just ETH that is being staked and giving your yield to sfrxETH holders (not you). So the more people using FraxChain the higher the sfrxETH yield and the more sfrxETH will be minted to chase that yield. I don't know what the yield elasticity for something like this is. If rETH had a 1% higher yield, how much more rETH would be minted? How does incremental yield compare in attracting liquidity compared to other factors like convenience of access (which stETH dominates), decentralization safety (which rETH dominates), etc?\n\nObviously they're going to deploy their entire stack to their L2 to start. So at minimum it will have a native AMM, lending, etc. Their special purchase bridge will also mint frax assets as native tokens on the chain rather than having to bridge it in a classical sense. I expect they'll also get their major partners to deploy there (Curve, pyUSD, maybe Alchemix). I haven't seen anything here really writing home about.\n\n/u/Revanchist1 , you seem more informed than me on this topic. Is there anything substantial I'm missing here?

They've completely abandoned Frax redemptions. It's now entirely up to the AMO to defend the peg by selling protocol owned liquidity (POL). I guess this is their final answer to UST style concerns.

A series of these FXB with different expiries creates an on-chain yield curve. The profit from these risk-free rate instruments is used as the target rate for their new sFRAX token. This makes sFRAX basically a tokenized version of the Maker's DSR. To my eye I expect the plan is to use sFRAX as an interest bearing token to replace the FraxBP plan.

I think this sub was started because there wasn\u2019t really any subreddit exclusively talking about the Defi explosion that was occurring. At the time, there was only CC and Ethereum subs. CC is complete nonsensical  memecoin chasing and Ethereum is either complex technical discussion or noobs posting on the sub who want to engage in memecoin degeneracy but don\u2019t know how. </p>\n\n<p>I will say the quality of this sub has def been diluted due to the highs of 2021.
