The last gas limit increase was early 2021, almost 3 years ago. Cost of SSDs have substantially reduced since then\r\n2. Most L1 native apps (Maker vaults, ENS, LSTs) have not completed migration to L2s. Partly because we still don't have a Stage 2 L2 anyways. Which means users are still forced to use the L1, and pay high fees for basic and essential functions like taking a DAI loan or staking ETH for stETH.\r\n3. We are clearly on the cusp of mainstream attention, especially as an ETH ETFapproval nears in May. Which means we are going to run into exceptionally high gas fees under current settings, and a constant narrative that the \"Ethereum chain is unusable\". An entire cohort of new users (probably the largest wave of new on-boarded users to date) will see the ridiculous fees on L1 (and by extension, L2s), see the sub-cent fees on Solana, and simply gravitate to the cheaper narrative. We will unnecessarily lose out on the narrative war, and the Nov-Dec period of scorn to the ethereum community is, I fear, just a prelude. \n4. Most importantly: Vitalik has soft-signalled this twice in the past week. First, in the tweet thread on the roadmap update (when he pointed out gas limit increase doesn't need a HF and can be done anytime), and secondly and more explicitly, in yesterday's EF AMA. Now, the problems with increasing the gas limit: State growth, client stability, cost of minimal equipment - \\*of-fucking-course these variables are playing out in Vitalik's head\\*, he has written more on this than pretty much anyone alive. Of course he is aware of it, no? But pragmatic choices need to be made, and that is what I see here in his comments. \n5. Finally, I think it is time the ethereum community and core protocol development process \"formalised\" a framework for minimum validator specs per fixed cost of fiat. It can't be based on just vibes. It can't be that we want to - eventually - run a full validator on the computing power of a microwave (running lightclients is a differnet story). We need a reasonable threshold - something like a full validator should not cos more than $800 to assemble. And every 12 months or so, we review the hardware prices, and if it costs cheaper than $800 (or X threshold) to run a validator, we raise the gas limit (or number of blobs or whatever else).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Going to bring this up again: I strongly think we need to increase the gas limit, and Dencun is probably the best time to co-ordinate around this (although a HF is not needed for validators to increase the gas limit). </p>\n\n<p>A few things to point out again:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The last gas limit increase was early 2021, almost 3 years ago. Cost of SSDs have substantially reduced since then</li>\n<li>Most L1 native apps (Maker vaults, ENS, LSTs) have not completed migration to L2s. Partly because we still don&#39;t have a Stage 2 L2 anyways. Which means users are still forced to use the L1, and pay high fees for basic and essential functions like taking a DAI loan or staking ETH for stETH.</li>\n<li>We are clearly on the cusp of mainstream attention, especially as an ETH ETFapproval nears in May. Which means we are going to run into exceptionally high gas fees under current settings, and a constant narrative that the &quot;Ethereum chain is unusable&quot;. An entire cohort of new users (probably the largest wave of new on-boarded users to date) will see the ridiculous fees on L1 (and by extension, L2s), see the sub-cent fees on Solana, and simply gravitate to the cheaper narrative. We will unnecessarily lose out on the narrative war, and the Nov-Dec period of scorn to the ethereum community is, I fear, just a prelude. </li>\n<li>Most importantly: Vitalik has soft-signalled this twice in the past week. First, in the tweet thread on the roadmap update (when he pointed out gas limit increase doesn&#39;t need a HF and can be done anytime), and secondly and more explicitly, in yesterday&#39;s EF AMA. Now, the problems with increasing the gas limit: State growth, client stability, cost of minimal equipment - *of-fucking-course these variables are playing out in Vitalik&#39;s head*, he has written more on this than pretty much anyone alive. Of course he is aware of it, no? But pragmatic choices need to be made, and that is what I see here in his comments. </li>\n<li>Finally, I think it is time the ethereum community and core protocol development process &quot;formalised&quot; a framework for minimum validator specs per fixed cost of fiat. It can&#39;t be based on just vibes. It can&#39;t be that we want to - eventually - run a full validator on the computing power of a microwave (running lightclients is a differnet story). We need a reasonable threshold - something like a full validator should not cos more than $800 to assemble. And every 12 months or so, we review the hardware prices, and if it costs cheaper than $800 (or X threshold) to run a validator, we raise the gas limit (or number of blobs or whatever else).</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-11 04:12:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"khcoevx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_193ukvu","parent_id":"t3_193ukvu","score":53,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/aaqy","body":"Adding to your explanation, I think yesterday's discussion in the annual Ethereum dev's AMA about this subject is also relevant.
