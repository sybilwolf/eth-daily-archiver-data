Validator client (VC),  2. Beacon node (BN),  3. Execution Layer (EL) client\n\nThe VC has to be run locally by you as a solo staker.\n\n1+2 is usually called the Consensus Layer (CL) client. Eg. Lighthouse.\n\nSince the merge its recommended to run your own BN+EL pair for your VC to connect to, for security purposes.\n\nNow the rescue node is a fallback beacon node (with its own Execution Layer client). Your validator client connects to it instead of your own local (beacon node + EL) pair. If your VC is offline, you are not validating/attesting/proposing etc.\n\n**So rescue node = a fallback beacon node with its own execution layer client, in the cloud instead of your own local PC/network.**\n\nYour validator keys do not leave your machine while using the rescue node. Rocketpool rescue node is not staking on your behalf.
