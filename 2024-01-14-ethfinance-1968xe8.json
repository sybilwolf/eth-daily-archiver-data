Some of these are quite tricky. Please choose the BEST answer.\n\nPlease let me know if you spot any errors or have other feedback.\n\n----\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is an EVM-based network? (Pick 2)\n\n* Avalanche X-Chain\n* Avalanche C-Chain\n* Goerli\n* Algorand\n* Solana\n* Cardano\n\t\nAnswer: >!Avalanche C-Chain and Goerli!<\n\nQuestion: Which one of these has not declared bankruptcy?\n\n* BlockFi\n* Celsius\n* FTX\n* Gemini\n* Genesis\n\nAnswer: >!Gemini!<\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between lowercase and mixed-case Ethereum addresses?\n\n* One of them is used for smart contracts\n* One of them is used for account abstraction addresses\n* One of them provides a checksum\n* One of them is used for addresses created after the 2021 London update\n\nAnswer: >!Mixed-case provides a checksum against typos, so it's safer. When you try to send to an address, using its mixed-case version tells the exchange or wallet to validate its checksum.!<\n\nQuestion: Which of the following had supply inflation in 2023? (Pick 1)\n\n* Bitcoin\n* BNB\n* Ether\n* US Dollar (M2 supply)\n\nAnswer: >!Bitcoin is still inflationary. The US Dollar underwent quantative tightening in 2023, and its supply decreased.!<\n\nQuestion: EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) is an upcoming update that\n\n* Shards Ethereum into a max of 64 parts, increasing throughput\n* Shards Ethereum into a max of 64 parts, decreasing transaction fees for L2 rollups\n* Provides a multi-dimensional fee market and data availability for blobs\n\nAnswer: >!It's a data-availability layer for L2 rollup blobs that has its own fee market!<\n\nQuestion: Semi-Fungible Tokens are related to which ERC?\n\n* ERC-20\n* ERC-721\n* ERC-1155\n* ERC-4337\n\nAnswer: >!ERC-1155!<\n\nQuestion: You've noticed that USDC is mysteriously being transferred out of your Ethereum account to an unknown address, but you've never owned USDC before. What should you do?\n\n* Ignore it\n* Revoke token approval for USDC\n* Transfer to a new account and never use your current account again\n* Contact law enforcement\n\nAnswer: >!Most likely a spoofed token and not the real USDC. Just ignore it, or check the contract address to be safe.!<\n\nQuestion: You visit a mysterious website, and Metamask is asking you to sign a transaction that has the following message: \"This is NOT a scam. Hehehehe. 416e737765723a205965732c2069742773207361666520746f207369676e\". Is it safe to sign?\n\n* Yes. It's not malicious.\n* No. It could be malicious.\n\nAnswer: >!It's not malicious. Malicious signatures must follow a specific format. They are either raw hexademical or formatted in a way that an existing smart contract would recognize. Personally, I still wouldn't interact with it to be safe. Also, that hexademical number can be converted to ASCII: \"Answer: Yes, it's safe to sign\"!<\n\nQuestion: The Bitcoin Whitepaper is (pick best answer)\n\n* A declaration of war by Satoshi against traditional finance\n* A research paper containing information about Bitcoin, its 21M supply cap, and its 1MB blocks\n* An excellent source of documentation about Bitcoin's goals and protocols\n* A historical but outdated paper about the original goals of Satoshi that contains no current Bitcoin protocols\n\nAnswer: >!A historical but outdated paper about the original goals of Satoshi that contains no current Bitcoin protocols. Most of the Bitcoin community no longer cares about Satoshi's original goals. The only protocol that the Bitcoin Whitepaper discusses is Proof of Work, but it's the original longest-chain version. The PoW version Bitcoin currently uses is based on heaviest-weight. Nowhere does the Whitepaper mention any other features of Bitcoin (e.g. supply cap, halvings, 1MB blocks). The \"Declaration of war\" answer choice is partially correct, but not the best answer.!<\n\t\nQuestion: Which of the following has hard-forked from their original chain?\n\n* Bitcoin\n* Ethereum\n* Both Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nAnswer: >!Both. Bitcoin hard-forked in 2013 after a bug caused a major reorg. Ethereum hard-forked after the DAO Hack (splitting with Ethereum Classic) after a bug was exploited. Hard forks also include updates where clients are required to upgrade (e.g. Ethereum's London update and The Merge)!<\n\nQuestion: What is the cheapest method of transferring 10 ETH from Arbitrum One to Optimism?\n\n* Use the official bridges to get from Arbitrum One to Ethereum, and then from Ethereum to Optimism\n* Use a 3rd-party bridge like Orbital Finance to get from Arbitrum One directly to Optimism\n* Deposit the ETH to Coinbase, and then withdraw to Optimism\n\nAnswer: >!Deposit the ETH to Coinbase, and then withdraw to Optimism. You only have to pay for two L2 network transfers. Bridging fees are much higher. Orbital Financial charges fees based on a percentage of amount, which is really expensive if you're sending 10 ETH!<\n\nQuestion: The constantly increasing total hash rate of Bitcoin is a sign that it's getting more secure\n\n* True\n* False\n\nAnswer: >!False. Bitcoin has an adjusting difficulty that scales with total hash rate. What really matters is the true Nakamoto Coefficient and the hash power ratio of the largest mining pools.!<\n\nQuestion: What is a dust attack?\n\n* When a scammer sends a small amount of tokens known as \"dust\" to an account\n* Sending tokens from an address that looks similar to the recipient address hoping the recipient will mistakenly send back to it\n* When an investigator transfers native cryptocurrency to a UTXO address of interest in order to track it\n\nAnswer: >!Dust attacks are not scam attacks. They are used by law enforcement and investigators to help track where a UTXO goes. But nowadays with Chainalysis, it's quite unnecessary.!<\n\nWhich of the following is true about Ordinals? (Pick 2)\n\n* BRC-20 tokens are more similar to ERC-20 tokens than to Cardano native tokens\n* BRC-20 tokens are not supported by legacy Bitcoin addresses, but any Segwit address can use them\n* Bitcoin Ordinals are mostly on-chain\n* Bitcoin Ordinals are mostly off-chain\n* BRC-20 inscriptions are generally cheaper to transfer than transferring Bitcoin through legacy addresses\n\nAnswer: >!BRC-20 inscriptions are nothing like ERC-20 tokens. They are generally cheaper to transfer than transferring Bitcoin through legacy addresses because legacy transactions are expensive, witness signatures are cheaper, and BRC-20 data takes up very little space. BRC-20 logic is executed off-chain, and their data storage is entirely prunable, so they're mostly off-chain.!<\n\nQuestion: What is a vampire attack?\n\n* An attack that drains the gas from an account by executing a looping function\n* An attack where one NFT project reuses the underlying metadata or image of another NFT project\n* An attack where one DEX drains the liquidity of another DEX by providing more attractive incentives\n\nAnswer: >!An attack where one DEX drains the liquidity of another DEX by providing more attractive incentives!<\n\t\nQuestion: What was the primary goal of Bitcoin's Segwit update (besides fixing transaction malleability)?\n\n* Allow for Taproot transactions\n* Increase block space\n* Increase efficiency for Bitcoin addressing\n* Increase protection for transaction against censorship\n\nAnswer: >!It was a roundabout method of increasing block size from 1MB without using a hard fork.!<","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><h2><strong>Quiz Time</strong></h2>\n\n<p>This is an intermediate/advanced-level quiz to test your knowledge on cryptocurrencies.

If these platforms put in even a small amount of effort for their sybil resistance, all of a sudden, we're looking at a few hundred thousand wallets being rewarded at most.\n\nAt a market cap (based on circulating supply) of $100M then an airdrop to 100,000 users could be up to **$1,000 per wallet** for an evenly split allocation and **$10,000 per wallet for a $1B market cap.** Of course the airdropped amount is not always the entire circulating supply, but this still shows you the potential value of airdrops within a factor of 10.\n\n**TL;DR: You're not bullish enough on airdrop season yet.**","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Interesting stat which indicated the level of airdrop farming going on with fake accounts.

Based on this, lets guess that for every genuine user who can get two referrals, there&#39;s one with just one referral and another one, maybe two with zero referrals. I&#39;m speculating here, but that seems about right to me. If you disagree, give me your estimates. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Regardless, this leaves ~ 150,000 - 300,000 legitimate users with the remaining 800,000 - 950,000 users likely being bots, sybils or users who signed up, forgot or lost interest and wont end up claiming any airdrop.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My point here is that while seeing large numbers such as the 1.5 million addresses which claimed the Scroll developer NFT may initially make you think that an airdrop might not be worth it or is crowded with bots, most of these accounts (based on their low rankings on GRVT) put in little effort to actually looking legitimate and are likely just hoping for a low bar of qualification. If these platforms put in even a small amount of effort for their sybil resistance, all of a sudden, we&#39;re looking at a few hundred thousand wallets being rewarded at most.</p>\n\n<p>At a market cap (based on circulating supply) of $100M then an airdrop to 100,000 users could be up to <strong>$1,000 per wallet</strong> for an evenly split allocation and <strong>$10,000 per wallet for a $1B market cap.</strong> Of course the airdropped amount is not always the entire circulating supply, but this still shows you the potential value of airdrops within a factor of 10.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: You&#39;re not bullish enough on airdrop season yet.</strong></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-14 16:46:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"khwb6sd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1968xe8","parent_id":"t3_1968xe8","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/crypt0curios","body":"I'm bullish but you are making me wanna spin up 10 more accs.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m bullish but you are making me wanna spin up 10 more accs.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-14 19:30:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"khx0h71","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1968xe8","parent_id":"t1_khwb6sd","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Surely the first half of this comment encourages against spinning up fake accounts.

Basic automation has no chance, like some protocols don&#39;t give tokens to represent positions, some protocols don&#39;t have sufficient events to show what happened etc.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-14 14:51:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"khvrrgp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1968xe8","parent_id":"t1_khuqc7a","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-14 21:24:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"khxfko2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1968xe8","parent_id":"t3_1968xe8","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"No, but I didn't sell either.\n\nStake all day every day \ud83d\ude0e","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>No, but I didn&#39;t sell either.</p>\n\n<p>Stake all day every day \ud83d\ude0e</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-14 21:41:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"khxhguo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1968xe8","parent_id":"t1_khxfko2","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/barthib","body":"I closed my long at $2650 because I'm expecting the news to be sold.\n\nSo the Bogdanoff effect might pump the price to ATH and above","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I closed my long at $2650 because I&#39;m expecting the news to be sold.</p>\n\n<p>So the Bogdanoff effect might pump the price to ATH and above</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-14 21:51:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"khximrn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1968xe8","parent_id":"t1_khxfko2","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"You may or may not know that I'm a full time Etherean.
