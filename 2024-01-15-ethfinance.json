And this is probably sort of right.\n\nBut what they'll also need is an environment that fully communicates with the leading tokenization platform. \n\n[Ethereum currently holds 55% of all of defi's TVL](https://defillama.com/chains), here's your leading platform.

A rollup, a volition, a validium or any other hybrid solution is just what's needed to solve this problem. \n\nYou can be part of the ecosystem, but still retain some degree of control. \n\nNot only that but the cost will soon basically be net zero: we can safely expect that launching your own L2 on Ethereum will be as trivial as launching a smart contract: copy some open source code and let stakers manage security for you through Eigenlayer. How much did Hyperledger and Quorum cost to create and operate? I couldn't find figures but a shitload I'm sure.

How did you get to that number?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/191kke6/comment/kgw7lmx/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nSome thoughts after thinking about it some days. \n\nI was surprised that the goal is to reach 1/4 of all ETH staked and the argument is that it's a power of two. I was also surprised that e.g. the value secured by ETH doesn't seem to *really* influence the economic security Ethereum needs according to Justin Drake.   \nI asked the question because in the past months there were a lot of discussions about \"not overpaying for security\" etc. But to not overpay you need to know *when* you're overpaying, hence my question. I was expecting more assumptions/ calculations and less pragmatism tbh, but maybe this question can't be answered in a better way. (This is not a criticism, just documenting my expectation and why I was surprised --> I am not disappointed!) The only real assumption is the explanation by Vitalik how argues with CEXes and how much they can gather. \n\nApparently the discussion to \"cap\" ETH staked at 25% has progressed rather far, at least inside the EF. (\"I can confidently say that EF researchers have achieved rough consensus that stake capping is desirable\u2014expect EIPs and more discussion soon :)\"). \n\n*If* ETH staked will find an equilibrium around 25% of ETH, that would be a huge change. I am not even talking about solo staking, I think the impact on LSTs will be way bigger. The total addressable market for LSTs on ETH basically decreases from 90% to 25% with one EIP. That is a risk for tokens like LDO - because even if the LST market is winner takes all, the market is way smaller than we previously thought and I don't expect that the ETH value 4xes because of this change (and the missing fees from 4x bigger market are offset by 4x higher ETH prices). \n\nThis means vanilla ETH will be way more important (and I guess one of the reasons is also that Justin Drake thinks ETH is the best collateral for a decentralized stable coin) - but I think that also means that liquid restaking tokens will be more hyped. Cause if APY from LSTs goes down, the market will find other ways to produce yields for ETH holders... \n\nOn top it will be interesting to see if this potential change has an impact on the \"yield bearing money\" meme. At least I was hoping that yields could be one hyped topic with a potential ETH ETF (even if those are not staked ETH ETFs, just because people learn more about ETH and understand there can be yield for just holding a token). \n\nI guess (!) both yield and impact on LSTs won't be something for this cycle (= the next 2 years), so I think it's unlikely this *potential* change / EIP will change the narrative too soon. But it's still something to keep an eye on.... maybe?\n\nStill not sure what this means for solo stakers. Not sure what this means for the LST market in terms of time until we find a winner (will a lower equilibrium lead to a faster race to centralization because the market is smaller?) or if this even means it won't be winner takes all cause the market is now less interesting? \n\nSo looking forward to your thoughts, there's probably tons of things I have missed.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In the EF AMA last week I asked the following question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/191kke6/comment/kgw7lmx/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">What is the security budget Ethereum needs?

The only real assumption is the explanation by Vitalik how argues with CEXes and how much they can gather. </p>\n\n<p>Apparently the discussion to &quot;cap&quot; ETH staked at 25% has progressed rather far, at least inside the EF. (&quot;I can confidently say that EF researchers have achieved rough consensus that stake capping is desirable\u2014expect EIPs and more discussion soon :)&quot;). </p>\n\n<p><em>If</em> ETH staked will find an equilibrium around 25% of ETH, that would be a huge change. I am not even talking about solo staking, I think the impact on LSTs will be way bigger. The total addressable market for LSTs on ETH basically decreases from 90% to 25% with one EIP. That is a risk for tokens like LDO - because even if the LST market is winner takes all, the market is way smaller than we previously thought and I don&#39;t expect that the ETH value 4xes because of this change (and the missing fees from 4x bigger market are offset by 4x higher ETH prices). </p>\n\n<p>This means vanilla ETH will be way more important (and I guess one of the reasons is also that Justin Drake thinks ETH is the best collateral for a decentralized stable coin) - but I think that also means that liquid restaking tokens will be more hyped. Cause if APY from LSTs goes down, the market will find other ways to produce yields for ETH holders... </p>\n\n<p>On top it will be interesting to see if this potential change has an impact on the &quot;yield bearing money&quot; meme. At least I was hoping that yields could be one hyped topic with a potential ETH ETF (even if those are not staked ETH ETFs, just because people learn more about ETH and understand there can be yield for just holding a token). </p>\n\n<p>I guess (!) both yield and impact on LSTs won&#39;t be something for this cycle (= the next 2 years), so I think it&#39;s unlikely this <em>potential</em> change / EIP will change the narrative too soon. But it&#39;s still something to keep an eye on.... maybe?</p>\n\n<p>Still not sure what this means for solo stakers. Not sure what this means for the LST market in terms of time until we find a winner (will a lower equilibrium lead to a faster race to centralization because the market is smaller?) or if this even means it won&#39;t be winner takes all cause the market is now less interesting? </p>\n\n<p>So looking forward to your thoughts, there&#39;s probably tons of things I have missed.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-15 06:44:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"khyyk1o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1971kkf","parent_id":"t3_1971kkf","score":40,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Fly1n_Hawaiian","body":"Appreciate the write up!
