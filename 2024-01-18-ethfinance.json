Each Dex did something with liquidity 'at the edges' of a xy=k formula. Uniswap v3 created something like a limit order book rather than a smooth Curve but only liquidity from active positions got paid out. The net effect was liquidity being compressed towards the strike price by yield optimizers. This did reduce the effects of idle liquidity but also amplified IL. *Most* Uniswap v3 LPs have lost money compared to just hodling. Curve compressed that liquidity in a continuous rather than discrete way and added a volatility oracle internally to the Dex to remove liquidity depth and reduce IL during times of volatility. This has demonstrably been more profitable for most users than the Uniswap model and I still like it. Balancer boosted pools kept something like the xy=k formula but deposited the liquidity at the edges to money markets like Aave. This kept IL lower and made it something like a hybrid between an AMM and a money market. Obviously this only works for assets for which there is a borrow market to deposit to. Bancor imploded so I won't go there.\n\nIf I look at the innovation today the interesting stuff is all combining the AMM with lending in some way kind of like Balancer started doing.\n\ncrvUSD puts your lending collateral up as AMM liquidity. Because it's Curve, it's still using the liquidity compression form of the AMM. The result is a form of continuous liquidation that doesn't leak liquidation penalties to mercenary arbitrageurs. Lower protocol risk enables borrowers to take loans with riskier liquidation thresholds. Due to the collateral being on the Dex, you can also be 'unliquidated', and even make money with your collateral being used as liquidity on the Dex in net earn collateral while also having an outstanding loan. You can see how attractive this is to borrowers by looking at the borrow rates right now on crvUSD.\n\nBAMM retains the xy=k AMM model instead of having compressed liquidity it but it allows people to borrow the liquidity at the edges. So rather than having a boosted Balancer pool take the idle liquidity and deposit it to Aave, they shoved something like Aave directly into the AMM. Just like with crvUSD this enables continuous liquidations and deliquidations but it enables each AMM pair to permissionlessly become collateral for borrowing. The net result is higher liquidity utilization and you can permissionlessly borrow on any asset up to the limit of the AMM pool depth with no extra risk to LPs.\n\nLastly there is Ajna. Here you have the lenders and borrowers forming something a Uniswap v3 limit order book. Together they form a price signal that determines which lenders collateral is in use and when liquidiations occur. Because everything is self-contained, there's no oracle here either. Anyone can use this to create money market on any asset they like without having a shared risk structure like Compound or Aave have today. All three are fascinating and I'm still struggling to get my head around the details of Ajna and BAMM so I have no favorites yet other than to say it's something to keep an eye on and that we should discuss more.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Last time I wrote a landscape piece for Dex&#39;s everything was geared towards getting more capital efficiency with the idle liquidity on the Dex.
