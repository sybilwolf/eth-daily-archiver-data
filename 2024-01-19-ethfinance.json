Our <a href=\"https://www.rated.network/o/Consensys?network=mainnet&amp;timeWindow=1d&amp;idType=nodeOperator\">best data</a> shows that Consensys (who is operating validators for Metamask) operates about 1% of the validators on the beacon chain. At this time this is favorable to exchanges or LST entities who control larger shares of the beacon chain.</p>\n\n<p>Consensys is well regarded and well funded, so we have every reason to believe they&#39;ll remain solvent and do a good job staking these funds. Since Metamask is a Consensys product, I&#39;d say that this shift is part of Consensys&#39;s ongoing quest to monetize Metamask, and I&#39;m okay with this path.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-19 05:15:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kil0j6g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_19ac5xh","parent_id":"t1_kikvvvd","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/alexiskef","body":"Hey Phiz!
