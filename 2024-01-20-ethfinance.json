The key observation is that, because of batching, the AMM does not need to satisfy path independence, which implies that the design space is larger than without batching. In particular, it is possible to design a function maximizing AMM (FM-AMM), which, for given prices, always trades to be on the highest possible value of a given function. At the same time, batching creates competition between informed arbitrageurs. As a result of this competition, the price at which the FM-AMM trades is always equal to the equilibrium price (assumed determined on some very liquid location and exogenous to the FM-AMM). Hence, whereas in a traditional CFAMM, arbitrageurs earn profits at the expense of liquidity providers, in an FM-AMM these profits remain with its LPs.

When you have e.g. 1000 separate validators running on a machine/setup, they are spread out into 32 different buckets of attestations per epoch. This means you would only have potentially 1/32 of your validators get slashed during the slot after you made your mistake.

If you mess up, the single huge validator gets slashed at once, with no advance warning for the other 31/32, because all of that attestation weight is concentrated into one slot, not spread out across all 32 in the epoch.

I try to stick to projects I like and not get too degenerate. This helps it feel legitimate to me as the original airdrop idea was to give shares and a stake in the platform out to the community. But two wallets? A true sybil resistant system would call me out for that and either penalise me or only reward me once. Is having two wallets being greedy? Maybe. Personally it feels like a rational balance between the following:\n\n- Fighting airdrop farmers with dozens or hundreds of wallets who might be diluting my share.\n\n- Not blatantly farming/sybil attacking the drop mechanism.\n\n- Not spending too much mental and financial overhead speculating on something which may not happen.\n\nOn the other hand, to me, the idea of having a dozen wallets or more to farm an airdrop feels wrong. The developers will set a certain amount tokens to the community and if you game their mechanisms and qualify on 10 wallets, then you get 10 slices of the pie instead of 1. This adds 9 more slices to the pie than an anti-sybil minded developer would have ideally intended. Since this has no effect on the total number of tokens in the airdrop, your sybil wallets have eaten into the size of the slices of everyone else. In short, airdrop distributions are a zero sum game and more tokens for you means less for someone else.\n\nNow I'm not trying to virtue signal or shame anyone for having 10 wallets. There's no ethical code about how much free money someone is entitled to. Furthermore, there is a justifiable and rational argument that since others are sybil attacking, you need to too. After all, you\u2019re not eating into the average Joe\u2019s piece of the pie, you\u2019re eating into the faceless big airdrop farm in China with 1,000 wallets run by a computer program. At the end of the day, it is the developer\u2019s job to ensure that the distribution is sybil resistant and makes it to the community and not the spammers.\n\nThis is in the same vein of human coordination problems we face with MEV \u2014 an arms race appears to capture economic value as no amount of virtue signalling and solo stalkers opting to build their own blocks will be enough coordination to stop rational actors from doing what makes the most economic sense. In fact, being virtuous just leaves more profit for the \u201cbad\u201d and less values driven actors. So with that said, does that make being virtuous and leaving more value on the table actively counter productive for our values? In the bigger picture, this is why we need things like proposer-builder separation. To remove as many of these mechanisms of value capture which involve some kind of arms race. This is because in these areas of competitive value capture, there is almost always a centralising force over time towards those who are the most successful and in some cases, the most brutal with their tactics (see block proposal timing games for the latest development here).\n\nTo get back on the original topic, why two wallets? I guess it's just the way I was raised to not be too greedy or selfish in a zero sum game. As I said above, I\u2019d be taking more from someone else\u2019s slice. But on the other hand, I\u2019m not lost in an idealistic world. The rational side of my brain sees how the game theory plays out and says farm that airdrop and take a slice out of the big boys\u2019 pie as they\u2019d only spend the money on stupid things anyway. So here I am, somewhere in the middle. I\u2019m definitely putting effort into farming airdrops and with 2 wallets, maybe taking a larger slice than I\u2019m fairly entitled to. However, it is still less than I could get if I really wanted more.\n\nAll this is probably a similar reason to why I just want a house in the countryside somewhere and not a gazillion rental properties, a ferrari and a yacht. I would get very marginal enjoyment out of such fancy things and that marginal enjoyment nowhere near equates to the amount of good for others which those millions of dollars could do if they were put to more productive work. After all, spending money tells society where to put its effort. Collectively we get much more from feeding and housing people than we do from vroom vroom shiny car go fast. But still, even 90% of the world aren\u2019t lucky enough to own their own home and live in a safe, stable, country. So at this rate I\u2019ll likely be getting a bigger slice than I\u2019d be fairly entitled to if the world\u2019s resources were split evenly. But in the situation I have been fortunate enough to find myself in, I don\u2019t feel overly greedy and I hope that\u2019s good enough.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading me share my thought process.

I do adore you in so many ways tricky, and I'm honored that you consider my positions and our alignment. Here are too many bullet points that will definitely make me late for the shower.\n\n1. I don't want anyone to exaggerate my wholesomeness and assume that I am too \"good\" to airdrop farm or use multiple accounts. I definitely have and will continue to use multiple accounts if it appears that those mundane actions will increase my qualifications for an airdrop.\n\n2. In general, I see airdrops differently than other people. I don't typically view airdrops as a benefit to the end recipient, but as a combination of a VC liquidity tool, or an engagement farming technique that allows startups to more easily create a case to VC for additional funding or valuation. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you're probably not abusing the airdrop, but in most cases I think the airdrop is taking advantage of you by farming you. They're trying to pump key metrics through farming user activities, this lets them prove to VC that their platform really is worth funding.\n\n3. My recent pushback against points is along this vein - if you're farming away for imaginary points but startups are using your metrics as proof of success to VC, then there's a good chance you're just straight up being abused. Do you know what VC likes even MORE than users who exert little outflow on a startup? FREE users. If a startup can generate a ton of activity for ZERO cost AND have a rabid user base, they're going to win big. I really adore big winners, but I want those winners to be good products, not just good incentive farmers.\n\n4. I'm really just encouraging people to take their own farming to the next level by engaging intelligently with projects that they like rather than being mindless zombies jumping through hoops. I don't know why, or if it even makes sense, it's just where I'm at right now.\n\n5. I feel like EVERYONE thinks I'm targeting eigenlayer, and I'm not. I have hesitancy about Eigenlayer because of its impact on the security layer, and I accept it as a natural evolution of our space. I have no intention or desire to target them for their airdrop mechanism, other than to say, farming for points can be risky and create a house of cards in certain cases.\n\n6. Regarding the greed issue (ferraris and yachts), I definitely align with you - I want to carve out a fair share and leave enough pie for others, but that doesn't mean I'm some kind of altruistic monk. I DO enjoy the benefits of wealth and I do hope to continue building wealth, but it's true that I take a more socialistic approach than many others. I feel like if we build Ethereum to be super powerful and valuable, then we will also benefit from that value; but if all of us focus on greed and extraction now, everyone will suffer in the long run. I prefer to think of cryptocurrency as a nascent project that has 1000x growth potential (platform, not price) if we foster healthy growth, or it can have a quick death if everyone extracts without regenerating.\n\n7. Finally, I want to remind everyone that value and wealth are represented by more than money. Money is fun, but money is only useful when it's used in an environment where it can bring you benefit. As a worst case scenario, money was useless in the stone age because it couldn't bring benefit. I have a real belief that if we bring blockchain developments to fruition, then the entire world will have access to more benefit. NFTs are a horrible (but useful) example of this. Prior to blockchains, you could have billions of dollars, but still no access to NFTs. Money could not provide that benefit because blockchains hadn't been developed to the extent that they were possible. There are MANY other developments that will be possible in the future if we continue developing this technology, and when we do, our money will be even more useful than it is today because we'll have access to more value from it through blockchain developments.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>No flowery preamble because my wife is demanding that I get in the shower for a day trip.

I really adore big winners, but I want those winners to be good products, not just good incentive farmers.</p></li>\n<li><p>I&#39;m really just encouraging people to take their own farming to the next level by engaging intelligently with projects that they like rather than being mindless zombies jumping through hoops. I don&#39;t know why, or if it even makes sense, it&#39;s just where I&#39;m at right now.</p></li>\n<li><p>I feel like EVERYONE thinks I&#39;m targeting eigenlayer, and I&#39;m not. I have hesitancy about Eigenlayer because of its impact on the security layer, and I accept it as a natural evolution of our space. I have no intention or desire to target them for their airdrop mechanism, other than to say, farming for points can be risky and create a house of cards in certain cases.</p></li>\n<li><p>Regarding the greed issue (ferraris and yachts), I definitely align with you - I want to carve out a fair share and leave enough pie for others, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m some kind of altruistic monk. I DO enjoy the benefits of wealth and I do hope to continue building wealth, but it&#39;s true that I take a more socialistic approach than many others. I feel like if we build Ethereum to be super powerful and valuable, then we will also benefit from that value; but if all of us focus on greed and extraction now, everyone will suffer in the long run. I prefer to think of cryptocurrency as a nascent project that has 1000x growth potential (platform, not price) if we foster healthy growth, or it can have a quick death if everyone extracts without regenerating.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, I want to remind everyone that value and wealth are represented by more than money. Money is fun, but money is only useful when it&#39;s used in an environment where it can bring you benefit. As a worst case scenario, money was useless in the stone age because it couldn&#39;t bring benefit. I have a real belief that if we bring blockchain developments to fruition, then the entire world will have access to more benefit. NFTs are a horrible (but useful) example of this. Prior to blockchains, you could have billions of dollars, but still no access to NFTs. Money could not provide that benefit because blockchains hadn&#39;t been developed to the extent that they were possible. There are MANY other developments that will be possible in the future if we continue developing this technology, and when we do, our money will be even more useful than it is today because we&#39;ll have access to more value from it through blockchain developments.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-20 04:50:08","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-01-20 04:54:10","id":"kiqdeel","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_19b4wii","parent_id":"t1_kipwmck","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Shower thoughts","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Shower thoughts</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-20 07:06:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kiqvac3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_19b4wii","parent_id":"t1_kiqdeel","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Wow, those are some really good insights, phiz!
