Let's say minority clients have a 5% chance per month of a critical bug and Geth has a 1% change per month. Then if all slashing were to be equal, this would incentivise Geth. However, this is not the case. Due to the exponential increase in slashing amounts during an activity leak, the lower risk of getting slashed running geth is by far outweighed by the huge cost of what happens in the 1% chance scenario. So if this hypothetical scenario were run 1000s of times, it would be more profitable for people to adopt minority clients.  \nFor example:  \n\n\n||Probability|Losses incurred|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Minority client has a bug:|5%|Missed attestations \\~ 0.0001ETH|\n|Geth bug (majority client):|0.5%|Up to 32 ETH|\n\nBut as we know, the above table is the status quo. People are famously bad at factoring in and hedging for black swan events. But the opposite is true for lottery like events. People love to gamble on doubling their money or making millions. So let's see how the table looks with your proposal factored in (note that the table is now showing odds of winning, not losing):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Probability|Reward for client still running|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Minority client has a bug, Geth keeps running|5%|Nothing|\n|Geth has a bug, minority clients keep running|0.5%|80% of network gets slashed 50-100% of their stake. **Reward \\~ 64-128 ETH per 32 validator**|\n\nThe above is much more appealing to make people put the effort into changing their execution client. Furthermore, such an event would tank the price of ETH and frankly it's not fair on the folks who were actually keeping the network running properly, so they should be compensated.\n\nBased on the above tables, if you value the probabilities, then 0.5% of 64-128 ETH (let's just say 100) is 0.5 ETH. If I strictly cared about money and not decentralisation, then getting 0.5 ETH *per node* to be offline for 1-2 days max while I change over from Geth to a minority client is absolutely a good deal for the few hours of work. So to me this seems like a decent proposal. My biggest doubt however is simply that not enough people weigh in such small probabilities into their decision making.\n\nPlease anyone let me know if I got any numbers wrong. But this may be a good idea. Obviously there is a lot to consider such as unintended consequences. The first of which that occurs to me is that it would incentivise people even more to find a Geth bug and not report it as a white hat hacker, but only so long as Geth has a supermajority which I don't think would last long with such incentives.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This is actually a really interesting proposition. Let&#39;s say minority clients have a 5% chance per month of a critical bug and Geth has a 1% change per month. Then if all slashing were to be equal, this would incentivise Geth. However, this is not the case. Due to the exponential increase in slashing amounts during an activity leak, the lower risk of getting slashed running geth is by far outweighed by the huge cost of what happens in the 1% chance scenario. So if this hypothetical scenario were run 1000s of times, it would be more profitable for people to adopt minority clients.<br/>\nFor example:  </p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">Probability</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Losses incurred</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Minority client has a bug:</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Missed attestations ~ 0.0001ETH</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Geth bug (majority client):</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.5%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Up to 32 ETH</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>But as we know, the above table is the status quo.

Minority clients would patch their software to accept the invalid block and they'd rejoin the majority network with a minor inactivity penalty. There'd be no network downtime, no slashings, no quadratic inactivity leaks, and no finalized transaction reversions. I don't really see it playing out any other way, not with so many negative consequences attached to the other option. Apologies to the chain spec purists in here, I just can't imagine a scenario where ~80% of staked ETH gets destroyed and the network goes down for ~weeks all in the name of maintaining the spec. \n\nUnfortunately that doesn't really hold true if the block is really bad or malicious in some way. Then the community has to decide between destroying millions of staked ETH and potentially weeks of downtime while the minority chain finalizes or accepting the results of whatever the block did to the chain. This is where bailout discussions (fights, more likely) begin and the chain quickly loses credibility and standing. Ethereum was nearly crushed by the DAO hack and there's way more at stake now. \n\nIt's still vastly preferable to not need to worry about either of these scenarios in the first place by eliminating supermajorities. And FWIW, this issue is not unique to Ethereum. Any chain could potentially have a disastrous bug in a client, even Bitcoin. Most chains would have to choose to either accept or revert the offending block, though, because there are no alternative clients. Ethereum is one of the few (the only?) that could potentially work through a client bug like this without human intervention, it just needs to not have any supermajority clients.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It all depends on what the actual bug is and what the invalid block contains.</p>\n\n<p>If it&#39;s just an odd client bug where Geth spits out something weird (and finalizes it) that the other clients reject, I think it becomes a relatively minor footnote in Ethereum history. Minority clients would patch their software to accept the invalid block and they&#39;d rejoin the majority network with a minor inactivity penalty. There&#39;d be no network downtime, no slashings, no quadratic inactivity leaks, and no finalized transaction reversions. I don&#39;t really see it playing out any other way, not with so many negative consequences attached to the other option. Apologies to the chain spec purists in here, I just can&#39;t imagine a scenario where ~80% of staked ETH gets destroyed and the network goes down for ~weeks all in the name of maintaining the spec. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately that doesn&#39;t really hold true if the block is really bad or malicious in some way. Then the community has to decide between destroying millions of staked ETH and potentially weeks of downtime while the minority chain finalizes or accepting the results of whatever the block did to the chain. This is where bailout discussions (fights, more likely) begin and the chain quickly loses credibility and standing. Ethereum was nearly crushed by the DAO hack and there&#39;s way more at stake now. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s still vastly preferable to not need to worry about either of these scenarios in the first place by eliminating supermajorities.

A large proportion of the people buying these cars will cite having more space and being safer on the roads for buying and forking out more money to buy these cars over traditional sedans, hatchbacks, station wagons and even old school pickup trucks/utes which were smaller than they are now.

Same goes for SUV's. You can pack the same amount of gear in the back of a station wagon as most SUV's. It's just that the SUV looks bigger thanks to the lifted chassis. Same goes for Geth. I thought Geth was the best because it is reliable and used everywhere. Well it turns out that Geth takes about 36 hours on average on my node to get up and running and back to attesting. But snapsync on Nethermind had that down to just 12-24 hours for me yesterday. Same hardware, same connection. Incredible.\n\nSo I'm not going to tell you not to drive a Ford F150.

Dig deep and you'll realise that there is more to it than you initially thought.\n\nBut regardless, I can share this narrative all I want.

Let's say minority clients have a 5% chance per month of a critical bug and Geth has a 1% change per month. Then if all slashing were to be equal, this would incentivise Geth. However, this is not the case. Due to the exponential increase in slashing amounts during an activity leak, the lower risk of getting slashed running geth is by far outweighed by the huge cost of what happens in the 1% chance scenario. So if this hypothetical scenario were run 1000s of times, it would be more profitable for people to adopt minority clients.  \nFor example:  \n\n\n||Probability|Losses incurred|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Minority client has a bug:|5%|Missed attestations \\~ 0.0001ETH|\n|Geth bug (majority client):|0.5%|Up to 32 ETH|\n\nBut as we know, the above table is the status quo. People are famously bad at factoring in and hedging for black swan events. But the opposite is true for lottery like events. People love to gamble on doubling their money or making millions. So let's see how the table looks with your proposal factored in (note that the table is now showing odds of winning, not losing):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Probability|Reward for client still running|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Minority client has a bug, Geth keeps running|5%|Nothing|\n|Geth has a bug, minority clients keep running|0.5%|80% of network gets slashed 50-100% of their stake. **Reward \\~ 64-128 ETH per 32 validator**|\n\nThe above is much more appealing to make people put the effort into changing their execution client. Furthermore, such an event would tank the price of ETH and frankly it's not fair on the folks who were actually keeping the network running properly, so they should be compensated.\n\nBased on the above tables, if you value the probabilities, then 0.5% of 64-128 ETH (let's just say 100) is 0.5 ETH. If I strictly cared about money and not decentralisation, then getting 0.5 ETH *per node* to be offline for 1-2 days max while I change over from Geth to a minority client is absolutely a good deal for the few hours of work. So to me this seems like a decent proposal. My biggest doubt however is simply that not enough people weigh in such small probabilities into their decision making.\n\nPlease anyone let me know if I got any numbers wrong. But this may be a good idea. Obviously there is a lot to consider such as unintended consequences. The first of which that occurs to me is that it would incentivise people even more to find a Geth bug and not report it as a white hat hacker, but only so long as Geth has a supermajority which I don't think would last long with such incentives.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong><em>Reposting my response to that here since it seems a lot of people missed that thread but I think its actually a smart idea.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>This is actually a really interesting proposition.

So let&#39;s see how the table looks with your proposal factored in (note that the table is now showing odds of winning, not losing):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">Probability</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Reward for client still running</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Minority client has a bug, Geth keeps running</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Nothing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Geth has a bug, minority clients keep running</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.5%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">80% of network gets slashed 50-100% of their stake. <strong>Reward ~ 64-128 ETH per 32 validator</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>The above is much more appealing to make people put the effort into changing their execution client. Furthermore, such an event would tank the price of ETH and frankly it&#39;s not fair on the folks who were actually keeping the network running properly, so they should be compensated.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above tables, if you value the probabilities, then 0.5% of 64-128 ETH (let&#39;s just say 100) is 0.5 ETH. If I strictly cared about money and not decentralisation, then getting 0.5 ETH <em>per node</em> to be offline for 1-2 days max while I change over from Geth to a minority client is absolutely a good deal for the few hours of work. So to me this seems like a decent proposal. My biggest doubt however is simply that not enough people weigh in such small probabilities into their decision making.</p>\n\n<p>Please anyone let me know if I got any numbers wrong. But this may be a good idea. Obviously there is a lot to consider such as unintended consequences. The first of which that occurs to me is that it would incentivise people even more to find a Geth bug and not report it as a white hat hacker, but only so long as Geth has a supermajority which I don&#39;t think would last long with such incentives.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-22 14:46:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kj40ofm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_19cou8k","parent_id":"t1_kj3dwh6","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Ethical-trade","body":"It still feels like a weird timing to ask solo stakers to switch to a minority client when the 2 main alternatives just had vulnerabilities.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It still feels like a weird timing to ask solo stakers to switch to a minority client when the 2 main alternatives just had vulnerabilities.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-22 03:23:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kj0z0ls","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_19cou8k","parent_id":"t3_19cou8k","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/eth10kIsFUD","body":"Let's at least try to protect solo stakers.\n\nValidators running nethermind perhaps lost a few bucks.
