About 1h later, I applied the fix, reverted back to the old database, and the node was fully online again.\n\nIn total, the attestation downtime made each validator earn 0.0007 eth less that it would have in normal operating conditions. This comes up to $1.57 per validator at today's prices, quite literally pocket change. Of course a missed block would have meant a much larger missed cost, but the chances of getting a block within the downtime window were quite low.\n\nAll in all, the issue was identified and fixed by the Nethermind devs incredibly quickly for a Sunday evening, and only caused a few hours of downtime.

This is a false assurance, because as any software developer realizes, bugs and security flaws can persist across many versions before being discovered, encountered, activated, or exploited.\n\nSome outspoken critics assure everyone that if a geth bug were to occur, it would better to be on geth as coinbase and LIDO would convince everyone to use the chain that they are on. These individuals seem to be the most hard to reason with, and seem to be the most stuck in their ways. No amount of explaining the technical differences in how a PoS chain, unlike a PoW chain, doesn't just automatically follow the supermajority or how this would destroy ethereum credibility seems to sway them.\n\nThese individuals must not realize they are immediately outing themselves as being unfamiliar with software development.\n\nAs someone who works on software, I think this attitude stems from a few areas:\n\n***- Lack of visibility into software development complexity.*** Building robust, secure software at scale is incredibly hard. Most don't appreciate how bugs can persist across multiple versions before causing issues, or being discovered or exploited.\n\n***- Overestimating reliability.*** Software, especially widely-used software, rarely achieves the \"*five-nines\"* reliability some expect. Latent bugs are still common.\n\n***- \"It's always worked before\" mindset.*** Fortunately, geth has operated smoothly for years, it's tempting to assume it will continue to do so, causing users to fall into the trap of discounting the very real risks of a geth supermajority bug causing irreparable harm to ethereum.\n\n***- Confirmation bias.*** We gravitate toward information confirming our prior beliefs. If someone believes shedding light on this problem might hurt the market price, they may ignore contravening evidence, or even fight against people who are attempting to get large organizations to fix the problem by sounding the alarm.\n\n***- Simplifying complex topics when discussing publicly.*** Nuance around software flaws gets lost, downplaying their potential impact.\n\n***- Trusting developers are on top of things.*** It's appealing to think developers always find bugs before trouble emerges. But holes persist.\n\n***- Individual risk tolerance.*** What seems an acceptable bug or risk to some may not be for others based on experiences.\n\n***- Herd mentality.*** Seeing others unconcerned about an issue reduces skepticism and concern. In conventional, non-blockchain software applications, the safest software is often perceived as the highest rated or most-used software. Blockchain reliability, especially in a PoS system, flips this concept on its head, making it difficult for users to understand why in the case of EL and CL clients, there is actually danger in numbers, not safety.\n\n***- Misinformation spreads rapidly.*** In the fast-moving tech world, misconceptions around software issues abound. Especially in emergent technologies that are not easy to understand like ethereum.\n\nWith ethereum now underpinning billions in value, it's crucial we foster informed dialog around supermajority client software risks. Underestimating them could prove costly. Just my two cents!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that discussions around ethereum EL and CL client bugs or vulnerabilities often feature confident assertions from individuals that it&#39;s &quot;not a big deal&quot; or that such discussions are just &quot;scare&quot; tactics or &quot;FUD&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Some see that the bugs in Besu and Nethermind did not result in an apocalyptic event, and due to their ignorance of the issues at hand, mistakenly assume the same quick and painless resolution should a supermajority geth client bug be similarly encountered or exploited.</p>\n\n<p>Others assume bugs can only be introduced in new versions, and assume that if they stay a version or two behind the official geth releases, they will be immune. This is a false assurance, because as any software developer realizes, bugs and security flaws can persist across many versions before being discovered, encountered, activated, or exploited.</p>\n\n<p>Some outspoken critics assure everyone that if a geth bug were to occur, it would better to be on geth as coinbase and LIDO would convince everyone to use the chain that they are on. These individuals seem to be the most hard to reason with, and seem to be the most stuck in their ways. No amount of explaining the technical differences in how a PoS chain, unlike a PoW chain, doesn&#39;t just automatically follow the supermajority or how this would destroy ethereum credibility seems to sway them.</p>\n\n<p>These individuals must not realize they are immediately outing themselves as being unfamiliar with software development.</p>\n\n<p>As someone who works on software, I think this attitude stems from a few areas:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>- Lack of visibility into software development complexity.</em></strong> Building robust, secure software at scale is incredibly hard. Most don&#39;t appreciate how bugs can persist across multiple versions before causing issues, or being discovered or exploited.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>- Overestimating reliability.</em></strong> Software, especially widely-used software, rarely achieves the &quot;<em>five-nines&quot;</em> reliability some expect. Latent bugs are still common.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>- &quot;It&#39;s always worked before&quot; mindset.</em></strong> Fortunately, geth has operated smoothly for years, it&#39;s tempting to assume it will continue to do so, causing users to fall into the trap of discounting the very real risks of a geth supermajority bug causing irreparable harm to ethereum.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>- Confirmation bias.</em></strong> We gravitate toward information confirming our prior beliefs. If someone believes shedding light on this problem might hurt the market price, they may ignore contravening evidence, or even fight against people who are attempting to get large organizations to fix the problem by sounding the alarm.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>- Simplifying complex topics when discussing publicly.</em></strong> Nuance around software flaws gets lost, downplaying their potential impact.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>- Trusting developers are on top of things.</em></strong> It&#39;s appealing to think developers always find bugs before trouble emerges. But holes persist.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>- Individual risk tolerance.</em></strong> What seems an acceptable bug or risk to some may not be for others based on experiences.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>- Herd mentality.</em></strong> Seeing others unconcerned about an issue reduces skepticism and concern. In conventional, non-blockchain software applications, the safest software is often perceived as the highest rated or most-used software. Blockchain reliability, especially in a PoS system, flips this concept on its head, making it difficult for users to understand why in the case of EL and CL clients, there is actually danger in numbers, not safety.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>- Misinformation spreads rapidly.</em></strong> In the fast-moving tech world, misconceptions around software issues abound. Especially in emergent technologies that are not easy to understand like ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>With ethereum now underpinning billions in value, it&#39;s crucial we foster informed dialog around supermajority client software risks. Underestimating them could prove costly.
