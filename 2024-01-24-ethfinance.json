It\u2019s just the canonical bridge that makes them so, and an L2 could be constructed without using a canonical bridge, giving them less security, but also the ability to fork. \n\n\n\nI was thinking this morning, while driving my kids to kindergarten in the dark, because it\u2019s so healthy for a 5yo to be forced to wake up while it\u2019s still nighttime, about this statement I often hear regarding why so-and-so entity will want their own chain as opposed to being an L2. This \u201cability to fork,\u201d as if being an L2 locks you in to whatever design you started out with. \n\nAs always, anyone smarter than me correct me where I\u2019m wrong, but this seems like bullshit to me. Here\u2019s why:\n\nForking basically means creating a new network (a new L1) in order to change some rules that are hard-coded in. Ideally, everyone in the community is onboard with the changes you wanted to make, and the whole ecosystem moves over, leaving the old network to die a quick and painless death. As an L2, changing hard-coded rules could be done one of 2 ways. The first is through upgradability. This is a little touchy because people say \u201cL1s aren\u2019t upgradable which is why we need a fork to change things.\u201d Well, a fork is just a round-about way to upgrade, where in the end you leave the decision over whether to accept the upgrades up to the ecosystem.  With an L2, you could create some sort of governance structure where the upgrade isn\u2019t possible unless there is broad ecosystem buy-in beforehand. Of course, this could get sticky, as you have to pick ahead of time who\u2019s important when it comes to these decisions and how their votes are to be weighted. An L1 fork is much more messy but also feels much more organic.\n\nWhich brings me to the next option. An L2 could just fork. They could spin up a new set of smart contracts, a new sequencer, copy the L2 state, and see if people port over. I know what you\u2019re thinking: the thing that matters most in an L2 is the bridge, and the assets that actually have value are locked on L1. To which I propose: that\u2019s a decision that an L2 doesn\u2019t have to make. \n\nAs an L1, you have your native asset, any assets built on top of your network, and any asset bridged to your network. As an L2, the first two are the same, but bridged assets are mostly done cannonically. But this doesn\u2019t have to be the case. It\u2019s much better to do it this way security-wise, but you could instead bridge IOUs to an L2 as easily as you can to an L1.\n\nTo illustrate. Let\u2019s say there was an L2 that used Ethereum as a consensus layer, in that the L2 was built as a set of smart contracts on Eth mainnet, but opted to not use a canonical bridge for assets. Ethereum would add the comfort of battle-hardened immutability for the chain, but not the tokens on it. Ethereum would ensure that the rules of the L2 were followed. You still benefit from not having to bootstrap a group of decentralized validators to protect against double spends or evil governments taking over your protocol. But you also aren\u2019t a slave to the canonical bridge. \n\nSo let\u2019s say the token in question is Eth, and it\u2019s all bridged to your L2 by something like Wormhole. And a bug in the L2 itself gives some exploiter the ability to steal everyone\u2019s Eth. Remember this Eth is IOU Eth. Now let\u2019s say the L2 wasn\u2019t able to easily squash the bug because this is some hypothetical future where the L2 had become as immutable as your typical L1. What they could do is simply FORK. They could copy the smart contracts and the state and spin up a new version of itself. The community (and more importantly Wormhole) would have to decide which version of the Eth IOUs were worth anything, just as we have to do when an L1 fork. These decisions over bridged assets would be determined by the entities controlling the IOUs, whereas the value of native L2 assets (like OP on Optimism Mainnet) would largely be decided via market forces. \n\nSo my question now is: how is spinning up an L2 any less flexible than spinning up an L1? The ability to fork an L1 simply means that you are giving up the security of a canonical bridge, which you could easily do as an L2 while keeping the other security benefits of being built on Ethereum. \n\nOk, someone tell me where I\u2019m wrong.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u201cAbility to fork\u201d is bullshit(?)</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr: L2s are not inherently less flexible than L1s.

In the immediate aftermath it would take hours to figure out they were on the same incorrect chain anyway. There&#39;s been enough turbulence in non-Geth clients in the past that it&#39;s not out of the question, particularly when the entire discussion is about incredibly low-likelihood events in the first place. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why would there be downtime/reversions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the community struggles to figure out a solution, it will take weeks for the inactivity leak to re-establish finality on the minority chain. That&#39;s downtime. Assuming the minority chain does end up winning out, any transactions that were processed by the supermajority chain essentially get reverted/undone. This has severe external repercussions for entities that interact with the real world. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Aside from that, imo the biggest externality of all is the risk of setting a precedent that we make exceptions to the protocol rules when a particular group does something stupid that puts their own stake at risk. If we bail out geth once, geth will expect to always be bailed out, and the geth supermajority may become more entrenched than ever. If we don&#39;t bail out geth, there will never be a supermajority ever again in the future of Ethereum, I guarantee it. We rip off the bandaid and the problem is fixed permanently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t agree that&#39;s the biggest externality considering the absolute mess this would make of any bridges or real-world interfaces where actions take place on the supermajority chain and are not present on the minority chain. But otherwise yes, these are all true statements and frankly I share this sentiment. Client diversity is critical and is fairly easy to accomplish, and committing to the supermajority chain after a split like this would essentially kill the push for client diversity. </p>\n\n<p>But my point isn&#39;t that we should keep a supermajority or anything like that. My point is that if this were to happen right now, in all likelihood the supermajority chain will win out. I know this sub is very gung-ho about staking and chain purity but it&#39;s a fairly small minority when it comes to Ethereum as a whole. I personally could not bring myself to support a minority chain if it meant destroying Ethereum like this. I like y&#39;all but I don&#39;t think I can be convinced that Ethereum would ever recover from choosing a ~20% minority chain and burning the rest rather than accommodating the supermajority.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-24 11:22:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kje082s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_19ea76a","parent_id":"t1_kjdslly","score":-1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"> An identical bug in other clients.
