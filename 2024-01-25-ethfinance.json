Instead of a flat 1/8 cap on the penalty, make the cap start at 1/8 and go up linearly over the course of one year to 100%, where it is now. This accomplishes multiple things:\n\n* Reduces immediate repercussions of a geth bug, like the flat cap does.\n\n* Gives everyone some time to switch off geth without worrying about losing their entire stake, particularly institutions who might need a few months due to tighter software process controls.\n\n* People can no longer reasonably ask for a bailout while the EIP is in effect, because there's no schelling point by virtue of it being a gradual linear function. You boil the frog slowly. At 1/8 penalty cap everyone knows there will be no support for bailout (not enough lost) and so they switch from geth because the risk of the penalty is very real, then at 1/4 penalty cap everyone is pretty sure there will be no bailout plus the penalty is bigger so any stragglers switch from geth, etc across the function until we reach 100% again. Maybe I'm giving people's reasoning skills too much credit though if they are currently willing to risk $50k of their stake to avoid $2 worth of downtime on a minority client.\n\n* In the long run (after the year expires), it keeps Ethereum fully incentive-aligned, cements the social contract of no bailout, and protects the chain against finality reversion.\n\nTo be clear, I don't necessarily like this idea and I am not advocating for it, but I think it's an interesting discussion space.

This accomplishes multiple things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Reduces immediate repercussions of a geth bug, like the flat cap does.</p></li>\n<li><p>Gives everyone some time to switch off geth without worrying about losing their entire stake, particularly institutions who might need a few months due to tighter software process controls.</p></li>\n<li><p>People can no longer reasonably ask for a bailout while the EIP is in effect, because there&#39;s no schelling point by virtue of it being a gradual linear function. You boil the frog slowly. At 1/8 penalty cap everyone knows there will be no support for bailout (not enough lost) and so they switch from geth because the risk of the penalty is very real, then at 1/4 penalty cap everyone is pretty sure there will be no bailout plus the penalty is bigger so any stragglers switch from geth, etc across the function until we reach 100% again. Maybe I&#39;m giving people&#39;s reasoning skills too much credit though if they are currently willing to risk $50k of their stake to avoid $2 worth of downtime on a minority client.</p></li>\n<li><p>In the long run (after the year expires), it keeps Ethereum fully incentive-aligned, cements the social contract of no bailout, and protects the chain against finality reversion.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To be clear, I don&#39;t necessarily like this idea and I am not advocating for it, but I think it&#39;s an interesting discussion space. And boy do I enjoy having discussions with y&#39;all.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/BigglyBillBrasky\">/u/BigglyBillBrasky</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-24 23:05:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kjh0blr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_19f2ia2","parent_id":"t3_19f2ia2","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/barthib","body":"People will not switch if they risk to lose 1/8 when they don't switch under a 8/8 threat.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>People will not switch if they risk to lose 1/8 when they don&#39;t switch under a 8/8 threat.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-24 23:50:30","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-01-25 00:01:57","id":"kjh4eg8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_19f2ia2","parent_id":"t1_kjh0blr","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptomoon2020","body":"That isn't true.
