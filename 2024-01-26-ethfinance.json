It&#39;s the absolute reason we need to drive consensus for the chain into homes and with individuals and not lock it up with service providers.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-26 01:24:03","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-01-26 02:36:19","id":"kjmvyar","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1abbg8a","parent_id":"t1_kjmuzpx","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"True but you could say that it would be against the ethos of ethereum to in such a scenario just continue without the besu/nethermind validators, a lot of them being solo stakers (and essentially the social layer of ethereum)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>True but you could say that it would be against the ethos of ethereum to in such a scenario just continue without the besu/nethermind validators, a lot of them being solo stakers (and essentially the social layer of ethereum)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-26 01:32:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kjmwn0q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1abbg8a","parent_id":"t1_kjmvyar","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"Oh, I ABSOLUTELY agree that it's against the ethos of Ethereum, it's why I spend fifty eight hours a day trying to adjust the social parameters so that the community would lead the chain in the event of a consensus fork.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Oh, I ABSOLUTELY agree that it&#39;s against the ethos of Ethereum, it&#39;s why I spend fifty eight hours a day trying to adjust the social parameters so that the community would lead the chain in the event of a consensus fork.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-26 01:36:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kjmwy54","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1abbg8a","parent_id":"t1_kjmwn0q","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProfStrangelove","body":"dude come on... only fifty eight hours a day... gotta up those rookie numbers \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(thank you for your service)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>dude come on... only fifty eight hours a day... gotta up those rookie numbers </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>(thank you for your service)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-26 01:42:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kjmxdry","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1abbg8a","parent_id":"t1_kjmwy54","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Indeed thanks for your service Phiz.

If they continue to suggest that other clients aren't mature enough, we'll wonder why Coinbase is [utilizing open source software without contributing back](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1750199002056769994) to the code base as would be expected.\n\n[AllNodes](https://twitter.com/Allnodes/status/1750519886286295117), [p2p.org](https://twitter.com/P2Pvalidator/status/1750550082934472885), and [Anker](https://twitter.com/Archer_MD_/status/1750892604584001975) announced switching to minority clients within the past 24 hours. This switch is a great illustration of how efficiently large operations CAN shift clients if they choose to. The value of these victories, and the contributions by their respective contributors cannot be overstated. Thank you, Allnodes, P2P.org and Anker.\n\nAfter an initially [tone deaf defense](https://twitter.com/cryptoQuoc/status/1749572714833027494), Stakefish seems to be [changing its tune](https://twitter.com/stakefish/status/1750216552979251490) a bit, but despite a reference to the responsibility of client diversity, there's little apparent commitment to make real changes, so lets watch this one closely.\n\nLido operators represent the [largest group](https://www.rated.network/?network=mainnet&view=pool&timeWindow=1d&page=1&poolType=all) of validator operators, and [our data suggests](https://execution-diversity.info/) that they're still highly reliant on geth. /u/yorickdowne has been a great advocate for decentralization from within lido, as a node operator for reducing the supermajority client, but the push hasn't been very successful yet. I'm optimistic that at some point they'll act in their own best interest.\n\nHanni Abu's [ClientDiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org/) is our best view into client diversity, and the execution client data currently sourced by word of mouth. While I look forward to more and better data, I deeply appreciate and value this source.\n\nI'd like to send good vibes to everyone who is working on this front, groups like [EthStaker](https://ethstaker.cc), led by /u/nixorokish, [Jasper the Friendly Ghost](https://twitter.com/drjasper_eth), who is pouring his passion into this [and I sure af hope he's still thriving in med school], and [Anthony Sassano who, through The Daily Gwei](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDailyGwei), beats this drum CONTINUOUSLY, also /u/interweaver for reaching out to providers and educating about the risks of a majoriy client fault. And perhaps the biggest thanks to /u/hanniabu through [EtherAlpha](https://etheralpha.org/) who tirelessly develops data that enables all of us to see the threats ahead of us. Without his efforts we'd be flying blind toward a black hole.\n\nNone of this even mentions the deep and detailed academic work and research going into client diversity. Thanks to /u/haurog for providing [insight into the academic and EIP efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1abbg8a/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2024/kjmr7ds/).\n\nFor my part, I'm continuing to go back to home stakers as the best future for the network. Giving lots of control of the network to third parties with little or nothing at stake is dangerous and undermines the goal of a decentralized network. If you have any way to stake from home, as a solo staker, Rocket Pool operator, DVT operator - whatever - I really encourage you to do that.\n\nI've started a [very [very] basic document](https://github.com/superphiz/topics/blob/master/execution_client_diversity.txt) to help us track these events, please feel free to hop in and help develop it as you see fit.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You should know that the tide toward client diversity is changing dramatically. I&#39;d like to thank the folks who have supported this work and those who have provided great updates here and I&#39;d 100% encourage you to continue engaging in that community service role.</p>\n\n<p>On January 22, 2024, Brian Armstrong from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1749552489509392696\">Coinbase responded to DCInvestor</a> to say that he was <a href=\"https://checkout.poap.xyz/167170/crypto?step=1\">taking a look</a> at client diversity within Coinbase&#39;s staking operation and they&#39;ll report back in February. If they continue to suggest that other clients aren&#39;t mature enough, we&#39;ll wonder why Coinbase is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1750199002056769994\">utilizing open source software without contributing back</a> to the code base as would be expected.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Allnodes/status/1750519886286295117\">AllNodes</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/P2Pvalidator/status/1750550082934472885\">p2p.org</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Archer_MD_/status/1750892604584001975\">Anker</a> announced switching to minority clients within the past 24 hours. This switch is a great illustration of how efficiently large operations CAN shift clients if they choose to. The value of these victories, and the contributions by their respective contributors cannot be overstated. Thank you, Allnodes, P2P.org and Anker.</p>\n\n<p>After an initially <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptoQuoc/status/1749572714833027494\">tone deaf defense</a>, Stakefish seems to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stakefish/status/1750216552979251490\">changing its tune</a> a bit, but despite a reference to the responsibility of client diversity, there&#39;s little apparent commitment to make real changes, so lets watch this one closely.</p>\n\n<p>Lido operators represent the <a href=\"https://www.rated.network/?network=mainnet&amp;view=pool&amp;timeWindow=1d&amp;page=1&amp;poolType=all\">largest group</a> of validator operators, and <a href=\"https://execution-diversity.info/\">our data suggests</a> that they&#39;re still highly reliant on geth. <a href=\"/u/yorickdowne\">/u/yorickdowne</a> has been a great advocate for decentralization from within lido, as a node operator for reducing the supermajority client, but the push hasn&#39;t been very successful yet. I&#39;m optimistic that at some point they&#39;ll act in their own best interest.</p>\n\n<p>Hanni Abu&#39;s <a href=\"https://clientdiversity.org/\">ClientDiversity.org</a> is our best view into client diversity, and the execution client data currently sourced by word of mouth. While I look forward to more and better data, I deeply appreciate and value this source.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to send good vibes to everyone who is working on this front, groups like <a href=\"https://ethstaker.cc\">EthStaker</a>, led by <a href=\"/u/nixorokish\">/u/nixorokish</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drjasper_eth\">Jasper the Friendly Ghost</a>, who is pouring his passion into this [and I sure af hope he&#39;s still thriving in med school], and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheDailyGwei\">Anthony Sassano who, through The Daily Gwei</a>, beats this drum CONTINUOUSLY, also <a href=\"/u/interweaver\">/u/interweaver</a> for reaching out to providers and educating about the risks of a majoriy client fault. And perhaps the biggest thanks to <a href=\"/u/hanniabu\">/u/hanniabu</a> through <a href=\"https://etheralpha.org/\">EtherAlpha</a> who tirelessly develops data that enables all of us to see the threats ahead of us. Without his efforts we&#39;d be flying blind toward a black hole.</p>\n\n<p>None of this even mentions the deep and detailed academic work and research going into client diversity. Thanks to <a href=\"/u/haurog\">/u/haurog</a> for providing <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1abbg8a/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2024/kjmr7ds/\">insight into the academic and EIP efforts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For my part, I&#39;m continuing to go back to home stakers as the best future for the network. Giving lots of control of the network to third parties with little or nothing at stake is dangerous and undermines the goal of a decentralized network. If you have any way to stake from home, as a solo staker, Rocket Pool operator, DVT operator - whatever - I really encourage you to do that.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve started a <a href=\"https://github.com/superphiz/topics/blob/master/execution_client_diversity.txt\">very [very] basic document</a> to help us track these events, please feel free to hop in and help develop it as you see fit.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-26 02:29:54","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-01-26 12:28:33","id":"kjn17qc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1abbg8a","parent_id":"t3_1abbg8a","score":81,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pa7x1","body":"I would like to give props to /u/interweaver too.\n\nHe carried a 1 month campaign on Twitter to pressure Coinbase.

So obviously not great, but not the end of the world.\n\nBut what you should be really fearing is not slashing, is the correlation penalties and inactivity leak. This is what brings a world of hurt, we are not speaking of 1 ETH here or a few gWEI for being a few hours offline. We are speaking of total loss of capital. Ethereum is supposed to be running and finalizing and is gonna try real hard to do that job. If a lot of the chain drops out for one reason or another. Because they are voting for a different bugged chain, because the validators go offline... whatever reason. The protocol applies these other penalties to protect itself from an attack and to try to recover finality ASAP. And they increase harshly the more validators that are affected simultaneously.\n\nSo, in summary, don't fear your client having a bug if you are in a minority client. You should fear having a bug at the same time as many other validators have a bug, or go offline. Best way to avoid it is by being uncorrelated with them. So run minority clients, do it from home, etc...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There is a bit of abuse of terminology.
