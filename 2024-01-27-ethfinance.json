But there are different penalties. Slashing is just one of them and is almost impossible to trigger by a bug. And even when it happens due to operator mistake it slashes for 1 ETH. Just so you can see it directly, here is a very recent slashing.\n\nhttps://beaconcha.in/validator/1061987\n\nThis validator lost 1 ETH (and a bit extra due to missed attestations after, but rounds to nothing) and is exited. But if there had been a mass slashing affecting many people, then the correlation penalty and inactivity leak kicks in, that's what can take you to total loss of capital.\n\nSo as I was thinking about it these days I noticed that mixing all the penalties under slashing might be partly why we have supermajority issues. Nobody wants to lose money for something they don't have control of. Much like people tend to fear traveling in airplanes more because the situation is out of your control. So losing your stack because of a bug you have no responsibility of is avoided, and everyone flocks to the client that is perceived safest. \n\nBut this is the wrong mental model of the network penalties, the network is not gonna punish you for uncorrelated issues because it's designed to work under imperfect conditions. So this doesn't really bother the network. If you have a bug with a very minor client you may be offline and missing attestations a few hours, maybe a day. That's nothing, penalties for that are very small. You would need to be 60% of the year offline to lose money for inactivity. That's how small those penalties are, a few hours here and there is not even something you can feel. \n\nBut if it loses at least 1/3 of the validators then the protocol gets pissed, because it cannot fulfill its duties. And then punishes, and can punish very heavily. The penalties here are the inactivity leak and the correlation penalty. This is what you should fear. \n\nSo the **TL;DR** of the story is that you shouldn't fear client bugs per se. You should fear having the same bug as many people, that's what triggers severe penalties. And the good news is that you have total control over it. You have the choice to not suffer significant loss of capital. It's entirely on you.
