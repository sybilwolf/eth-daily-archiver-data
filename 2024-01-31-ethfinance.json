It is long, but a fascinating read:\n\nPrologue\n\n** 11th Jan - Morning **\n\n- We noticed we had been forcefully logged out of our @Rocket_Pool twitter session.\n- No suspicous posts from the account, so could be a twitter issue.\n\n** 11th Jan, Afternoon **\n\n- We verified that my email address which had been associated with our @Rocket_Pool twitter account for the last 7 years was no longer being even recognised on twitter. Any attempt to reset the password or login with it, would show the email address could not be found.\n- We checked and could find no instances of any emails to us from Twitter indicating suspicious login attempts, password changes or failed 2FA attempts. We also verified in our emails that 2FA was on. We also verified that all the team members phones who had access to this account were also working fine and no SIM had been ported.\n- Case submission #1 To Twitter: Emailed from our accounts original email account that it had been associated with for 7 years to provide evidence we were still owners.\n\n** 12th Jan - Morning **\n\n- We received a reply back from Twitter, they had closed our case in less than 24hrs stating We\u2019re writing to let you know that we\u2019re unable to verify you as the account owner. We know this is disappointing to hear, but we can\u2019t assist you further with accessing your account... You\u2019re more than welcome to create a new account to get back onto X.\n\n** 12th Jan - Afternoon **\n\n- Case submission #2 To Twitter: This time asking what additional information would be required. We had emails showing 2FA was turned on, bank statements showing we had paid for Twitter Blue, screenshots of the same credit card that was used in that very transaction and more. We'd be happy to provide anything.\n\n** 13th Jan - Afternoon **\n\n- We received a reply back from Twitter, they had closed our case again.\n\n** 15th Jan - Morning **\n\n- Case submission #3 To Twitter:. I'd spent the 14th compiling a case with extra details to get the account back. We now had this, plus screenshots of 2FA being activated, bank statements for Twitter Blue and photo's of the credit card used to purchase that. We also pointed out that the Twitter accounts bio linked to rocketpool.net, exactly where I was emailing from.\n- We were beginning to suspect this may have been an error on Twitters behalf, as the account was still silent. Scammers would generally post straight away. So we held of on doing any Discord posts.\n\n** 16th Jan - Morning **\n\n- We received a reply back from Twitter, they had closed our case again.\n\n** 16th Jan - After **\n\n- Case submission #4 To Twitter:. We again submit our case to Twitter again.\n- We received a reply back from Twitter, they had denied our request.\n\n** 17th Jan - Morning **\n\n- Case submission #5 To Twitter:. We submitted all the same mountain of evidence from case submission #3 and ask for ANY extra clarification on what possibly else we'd need to supply to get the account back. We had absolutely irrefutable evidence the account was ours.\n\n** 18th Jan - Very Early Morning **\n\n- @Rocket_Pool awakens and starts posting scam tweets.\n- Case submission #6 To Twitter:. We urgently submitted updates to our case from the day before on the 17th. It was plain as day the account had been taken over.\n- Case submission #7 To Twitter:.

It is long, but a fascinating read:</p>\n\n<p>Prologue</p>\n\n<p>** 11th Jan - Morning **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We noticed we had been forcefully logged out of our @Rocket_Pool twitter session.</li>\n<li>No suspicous posts from the account, so could be a twitter issue.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>** 11th Jan, Afternoon **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We verified that my email address which had been associated with our @Rocket_Pool twitter account for the last 7 years was no longer being even recognised on twitter. Any attempt to reset the password or login with it, would show the email address could not be found.</li>\n<li>We checked and could find no instances of any emails to us from Twitter indicating suspicious login attempts, password changes or failed 2FA attempts. We also verified in our emails that 2FA was on. We also verified that all the team members phones who had access to this account were also working fine and no SIM had been ported.</li>\n<li>Case submission #1 To Twitter: Emailed from our accounts original email account that it had been associated with for 7 years to provide evidence we were still owners.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>** 12th Jan - Morning **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We received a reply back from Twitter, they had closed our case in less than 24hrs stating We\u2019re writing to let you know that we\u2019re unable to verify you as the account owner. We know this is disappointing to hear, but we can\u2019t assist you further with accessing your account... You\u2019re more than welcome to create a new account to get back onto X.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>** 12th Jan - Afternoon **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Case submission #2 To Twitter: This time asking what additional information would be required. We had emails showing 2FA was turned on, bank statements showing we had paid for Twitter Blue, screenshots of the same credit card that was used in that very transaction and more. We&#39;d be happy to provide anything.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>** 13th Jan - Afternoon **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We received a reply back from Twitter, they had closed our case again.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>** 15th Jan - Morning **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Case submission #3 To Twitter:. I&#39;d spent the 14th compiling a case with extra details to get the account back. We now had this, plus screenshots of 2FA being activated, bank statements for Twitter Blue and photo&#39;s of the credit card used to purchase that. We also pointed out that the Twitter accounts bio linked to rocketpool.net, exactly where I was emailing from.</li>\n<li>We were beginning to suspect this may have been an error on Twitters behalf, as the account was still silent. Scammers would generally post straight away. So we held of on doing any Discord posts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>** 16th Jan - Morning **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We received a reply back from Twitter, they had closed our case again.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>** 16th Jan - After **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Case submission #4 To Twitter:. We again submit our case to Twitter again.</li>\n<li>We received a reply back from Twitter, they had denied our request.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>** 17th Jan - Morning **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Case submission #5 To Twitter:. We submitted all the same mountain of evidence from case submission #3 and ask for ANY extra clarification on what possibly else we&#39;d need to supply to get the account back. We had absolutely irrefutable evidence the account was ours.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>** 18th Jan - Very Early Morning **</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>@Rocket_Pool awakens and starts posting scam tweets.</li>\n<li>Case submission #6 To Twitter:. We urgently submitted updates to our case from the day before on the 17th. It was plain as day the account had been taken over.</li>\n<li>Case submission #7 To Twitter:. We again update them with a new screenshot. Our official RP card (which they had photo&#39;s of from submission on the 15th) had just bought a new Twitter membership upgrade.

Still working my way through that one.  </p>\n\n<p>The short of it is, if you use the Earn Fixed Yield feature of pendle you&#39;re selling the rights to your LST&#39;s airdrop/points/yield in exchange for a fixed return that comes from other people betting that the airdrop + yield is worth more than they&#39;re paying for those rights.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you want to retain the rights to your airdrop, interact with pendle, and use the earn feature you&#39;ll probably want to provide liquidity. But that comes with variable yield and some minor impermanent loss according to their docs.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-31 15:24:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kocul5i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1afauzq","parent_id":"t1_kockzod","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/damonkey47","body":"Thank you for your reply!

The documentation around building and testing Silkworm locally is already pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think the team has laid out a compelling technical vision with Silkworm. If they can deliver on faster sync and execution times without reducing decentralization or security, it could be a big win for Ethereum. I&#39;ll be following the project closely as it develops.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-31 11:45:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kobrpgb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1afauzq","parent_id":"t3_1afauzq","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"In my former life I was a C++ dev as well.

The motive comes from a deep desire to see Ethereum become successful on a generational scale, and to empower individuals as part of the network. The opposing force of this initiative are business operators who seek to custody funds and centralize the Ethereum network under their control.\n\n> You\u2019ve referred to ETH staking from home as a small personal benefit but a large network benefit. Can you expand on that?\n\nYes! Every home operator gets the challenge and satisfaction of operating their node, in addition a solo staker running one validator earns about 3% a year (about $2200 at today's prices) for their effort, or running a Rocket Pool node with 10.4 Ether is likely to net about 6% ($1400 at today's prices). You have to add in the cost of hardware, electricity, and time spent, but there is a real financial reward for operating a home validator. To put it simply, it IS cost effective to run a single validator at home. Many people think that's the end of the story, but it's really only the beginning: Staking from home brings tremendous value to the network by giving us the superpower of robust decentralization. It  means that the \"voice of Ethereum\" becomes the voice of people around the world rather than a few centralized providers. This brings immutability on a world stage, meaning that no amount of power or coercion can unduly influence the expression of the chain. True decentralization gives confidence to national governments, corporations, and citizens that they can trust the chain and operate with confidence on the chain. This network benefit is immeasurable, and also very valuable to people who hold Ether as an investment. Staking from home makes your Ether more valuable in the long run.\n\n> You\u2019ve acknowledged that solo staking is neither cheap nor simple, so what can be done to simplify this?\n\nSolo staking is the gold standard for staking, it requires 32 Ether ($75,000), about $400 - $600 in hardware, and about thirty minutes a month in updating the client. As the gold standard operation, it also brings the most benefit to the network because you don't have to rely on ANY third party to participate on the beacon chain. I don't imagine that a lot of people can meet this standard, but I do spend a lot of time directing my messages to them because their actions have the biggest impact on our future decentralization. Setting up a home validator could mean that your family operates that validator and secures the network for a longer than a hundred years, and I truly see it as the new unit of atomic generational wealth. I'm also not sure that this is the group who needs things more simplified - if you have $75k of Ether, you already have a deep investment in the platform, I feel like most of these folks can spend a Saturday and watch a 30 minute staking video and get a validator operating if they wanted to. I feel like the current best way to improve this is to educate people about the value of solo staking so that anyone who holds 32+ Ether sees the value and reward in this work. As it stands, most of these holders are deposited into large institutions, leading to centralization and a long term devaluation of the asset.\n\n> I\u2019ve seen a bit of talk about how \u201cprofit maximization\u201d has pushed ETH stakers toward the best yield opportunity which, in turn, has sacrificed decentralization. Do you agree? If so can you discuss this in context of the increased reliance of the few liquid staking protocols and execution clients that have benefited from this tradeoff?\n\nI'm really amused by this because I'm a profit maximalist myself, but I have a much broader view of Ethereum than most people can see. Lets say you have $2000. If you sacrifice the network to extract 6% yield today, you'll get 6% on your $2000 investment, or $120. Because you invested in yield, and not in Ethereum, the platform creeps toward centralization and the price stays close to $2000 for years. However, if you invest in the decentralization of Ethereum by staking from home and in other decentralizing ways, the network becomes more decentralized, lots of entities feel comfortable transacting on the network and the price climbs steeply. Even if your return is only 5%, you're getting 5% on an underlying asset that is now more valuable because it has far greater utility. Ether is valuable because Ethereum has potential for future utility. Every investor will be most successful when Ethereum maximizes that potential. \n\n> How else can staking from home make Ethereum more robust over the long term, and what is an ideal percentage share of solo stakers that would make Ethereum properly decentralized?\n\nThe modern generation of cryptocurrencies, beginning with bitcoin in 2008, were a response to [centralized government entities who pandered to large corporations](https://www.amazon.com/Chancellor-Brink-Reproduction-University-Bedrooms/dp/B07YTFLNMS) rather than meeting the needs of citizens. Ethereum offers people an opportunity to reverse this in the future by empowering people from home IF they accept the opportunity. If people choose to stake with large entities, we can all be assured that those entities will focus on their own benefit in the future rather than the success of citizens. From this perspective, I deeply believe that radically decentralized home staking is a community service to promote economic fairness in the world.\n\n> Any other comments/ insights/ data you would like to share is welcome!\n\nWe're steeped in traditional capitalistic corporate thinking that focuses on a company developing a product and maximizing short term profits for shareholders, but this isn't the way Ethereum works.
