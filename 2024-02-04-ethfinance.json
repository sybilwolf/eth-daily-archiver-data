Your lottery ticket prices would be around whatever your operating costs are each month and the odds are so so much worse. </p>\n\n<p>I just looked at my states lottery site and the best odds I could find for a $1k prize on a scratch off is 0.0005%. </p>\n\n<p>There isn\u2019t really a 6eth equivalent as they all appear to be structured as, jackpot&gt;1k&gt;everything else. </p>\n\n<p>Mega millions has a lower tier $10k prize which is 1:931,000 <del>so that is similar enough with 0.001074%</del> oops I mixed this up it\u2019s much worse, 0.0001074%</p>\n\n<p>Of course with scratch off tickets the number is finite, the website says how many prizes remain. And drawing lotteries are only once a week .</p>\n\n<p>I think the odds on block proposals is still pretty good despite everything.
