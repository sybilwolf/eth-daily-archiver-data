Submissions for that finished a few weeks ago. We had 22 submissions in total. The submissions were analyzed by a team of 5 people comprised of team and community members, and today we have gotten the results of their analysis.\n\nThe top 5 ideas won $7000 between them. I'll break down what they include below.\n\n1st prize  $2500 prize- [Val's new bonding system](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/blob/main/2023_11_rapid_research_incubator/bond_curves.md). Val analyses the methods by which Rocket Pool can change bonding thresholds. He shows a path to LEB 1.5s (potentially) while still maintaining best-in-class security standards. The impact would be that Rocket Pool node operators far outearn solo stakers and Lido's community staking module.\n\n2nd prize $1500 prize - [Samus's eth-only validators](https://github.com/orangesamus/RocketPoolRapidResearchIncubator/). Samus suggests keeping the protocol commission at 14%. People who only stake eth will get 7.5% commission on a 4eth bond. The remaining commission will be divided out across people who stake eth and RPL. Here, you could bring whatever stake your were comfortable with and earn mroe than solo staking or with Lido's CSM.\n\n3rd place (x - no prize) - [Epineph's universal variable commission](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/options-forum-thread/2515/7). Variable commission would change how much Rocket Pool node operators earn as commission from rETH holders depending on how much supply of eth there is in the deposit pool. The more eth that is waiting to stake, the more NOs will get paid to bring more validators online.\n\n3rd place (1 $1000 prize) - [Luominx's no-rpl validators](https://github.com/luominx/no-rpl-bonded-minipools). This is another way to get validators on Rocket Pool with no RPL collateral required. The RPL value is derived in other ways.\n\n3rd place (2 $1000 prize) - [Val's eth-only validators](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/blob/main/2023_11_rapid_research_incubator/direct_capture2.md). This is another path towards having validators with no eth bond required. The RPL value is derived in other ways.\n\n3rd place (3 - $1000 prize) - [Occam's no-rpl megapools](https://github.com/defioccam/nrb-pools) \\- This is another path towards having validators with no RPL bond attached. The RPL value is derived in other ways.\n\nThe next steps from here are for the team and community to work together and work out a new tokenomics system that incorporates these ideas. It will likely be a mix of the submissions. However, it's pretty clear to see that it will involve some kind of sublinear eth bonding (the more validators you have, the less eth of collateral you need to bring for each one), some kind of variable rETH commission for node operators, and the option for validators to stake eth only or RPL on top to get outsized rewards - it will be their choice.\n\nThe path to scaling for Rocket Pool with these changes will be astronomical. Being node operator constrained (as the protocol is right now), will be a thing of the past. The next step will be adding incentives to rETH holding that will make it more and more attractive to hold - on top of it being the most decentralized and Ethereum-aligned.\n\nTomorrow, I'm going to bring some news to you all about a path toward a Rocket Pool and EigenLayer integration that could help Rocket Pool become the biggest liquid staking protocol on the market.\n\nThe future is extremely bright for Rocket Pool!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m back with a new Rocket Pool update!</p>\n\n<p>A while ago, I mentioned how there was a new tokenomics update incubator taking place.

At 30M ETH staked, the expected staking yield (with the current EL rewards, which the thread omitted) would be above 2.5 % for the suggested reward curve. It is incorrect to characterize this level of yield as enforcing 30M ETH staked. If no solo stakers would be willing to stake at a 2.5 % staking yield and nobody would be willing to delegate stake to the companies that the poster is associated with (Lido and P2P), but 30M ETH would be willingly deployed via CEXes, then this would be problematic. However, such a scenario is of course completely unrealistic.\n\nI have several times emphasized that Ethereum should provide a yield that makes it possible to solo stake, even if the deposit size grows very high (I am here potentially in the minority among researchers). Solo stakers are important. I discuss this in [Section 5.4 ](https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448/1#h-54-additional-properties-under-consideration-22)in my post. The reality of the situation is that the proportion of solo stakers may not be higher under equilibrium at say 70M ETH staked than at 35M ETH staked.

Otherwise, Ethereum does not benefit from facilitating 32-ETH validators.\n\nThe reasons for minimum viable issuance are pretty clear. Forcing everyone to stake within the Ethereum economy to have exposure to ETH without seeing their savings eroded is naturally utility-degrading in aggregate. It would also be very unfortunate to see ETH replaced by an LST when it comes to the role of being universal Ethereum money, binding the ecosystem together. This outcome could also make the social layer less robust in ensuring that Ethereum follows the intended consensus process.
