[Concentrator](https://concentrator.aladdin.club/) is AladdinDAOs auto-compounder for the Curve ecosystem. There's three layers to this.\n\n1) If you stake CRV for veCRV and you pair that in the right balance with the value of LPs you hold you get extra CRV issuance. Unfortunately this requires splitting your funds to also hold CRV with a time lock which not everyone liked.\n\n2) Convex addresses this by splitting these responsibilities into two separate parties and takes a small platform fee for doing so. That's what cvxCRV is. Yearn and StakeDAO do something similar with yCRV and sdCRV. But if you use Convex you still are claiming like 3 different tokens and having to compound the underlying LP yourself. It takes a few hundred dollars in gas to do this so unless you're playing with large sums you're probably only doing it every couple of months.\n\n3) Concentrator addresses this basically by being a pooled user of Convex and StakeDAO.

There&#39;s three layers to this.</p>\n\n<p>1) If you stake CRV for veCRV and you pair that in the right balance with the value of LPs you hold you get extra CRV issuance. Unfortunately this requires splitting your funds to also hold CRV with a time lock which not everyone liked.</p>\n\n<p>2) Convex addresses this by splitting these responsibilities into two separate parties and takes a small platform fee for doing so.

Treating your EL and CL rewards differently for tax purposes. In the sense that EL (block) rewards were fees/tips paid to you from existing ETH in the current supply, so it's taxable as income based on the fair market value when you receive them regardless if/when you sell them.

Where Jarrett (tezos staker) sued the IRS based on the grounds that he created the Tezos from staking (analogy being that if you bake cookies/grow apples at home you aren't taxed on it's market value at creation, only upon selling said cookies/apples). The IRS didn't want to bother defending their position or setting precedent, so they just sent him a tax refund of 4k for the taxes he paid on this Tezos staking income. Jarrett then refused to accept since he wanted a ruling to make sure it wouldn't happen again. Judge dismissed it saying he got a refund so there was no longer a case. As of now it seems Jarrett is in the process of appealing.
