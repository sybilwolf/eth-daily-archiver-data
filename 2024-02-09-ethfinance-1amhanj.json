I am part of EVMavericks and active in a few other groups on Discord where you can find me under another handle: Aybala.</p>\n\n<p>My real &quot;Aha&quot; moment happened when - thanks to this awesome community - I attended an EY blockchain conference in NYC, and learned about Baseline and the potential applications of zero-knowledge within my industry, supply chain. Ever since, I have been more invested, both financially and timewise, in the overall blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>As a non-dev and a non-social media person,  there are fewer possibilities to contribute to the ecosystem but being a delegate is something I can do.</p>\n\n<p>I can commit to you all that I would invest the necessary time to ensure the best interests of this group, that I can bring to the table a perspective that is able to empathize and consider a wider ranges of human experience and be meticulous and process-driven in approaching any proposals / initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate everyone&#39;s time reading this and the consideration. Let me know if there is anything I can answer for you.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-09 04:54:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kpmn520","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1amhanj","parent_id":"t3_1amhanj","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BroncoMontana78","body":"As a non-dev person with an (almost) exact professional background as you I\u2019d like to have a representative that is thinking along the lines of supply chain applications.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As a non-dev person with an (almost) exact professional background as you I\u2019d like to have a representative that is thinking along the lines of supply chain applications.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-09 05:42:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kpmtd5w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1amhanj","parent_id":"t1_kpmn520","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/UgotTrisomy21","body":"So many potential airdrops to look forward to this year!\n\nDIVA (for it to be unlocked and tradable)\n\nStarknet (soon apparently according to Argent)\n\nZksync (hopefully sometime this year?)\n\nEtherfi (TGE in April)\n\nEigenlayer (EL supposed to go live in Q2, so maybe airdrop in Q2-3 if they were planning for one?)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So many potential airdrops to look forward to this year!</p>\n\n<p>DIVA (for it to be unlocked and tradable)</p>\n\n<p>Starknet (soon apparently according to Argent)</p>\n\n<p>Zksync (hopefully sometime this year?)</p>\n\n<p>Etherfi (TGE in April)</p>\n\n<p>Eigenlayer (EL supposed to go live in Q2, so maybe airdrop in Q2-3 if they were planning for one?)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-09 03:11:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kpmciv7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1amhanj","parent_id":"t3_1amhanj","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/proof-of-lake","body":"Also Frame, Namada, maybe Scroll, maybe Phantom, maybe Linea.\n\nAbout 5-10 big opportunities on Solana for those that dabble there as well.\n\nNot to mention unexpected TIA staking stuff, or ones related to eigen points that aren't yet known.\n\nLink stakers also in line for many.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Also Frame, Namada, maybe Scroll, maybe Phantom, maybe Linea.</p>\n\n<p>About 5-10 big opportunities on Solana for those that dabble there as well.</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention unexpected TIA staking stuff, or ones related to eigen points that aren&#39;t yet known.</p>\n\n<p>Link stakers also in line for many.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-09 06:23:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kpmz5mw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1amhanj","parent_id":"t1_kpmciv7","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"> About 5-10 big opportunities on Solana for those that dabble there as well.\n\nI know this isn't the perfect place to ask, but any recs on Sol opportunities?

As one of the EVMs summarised very well, the market is effectively pricing in the expected returns of the points at 30%apr of the underlying collateral, hence PT-eETH is offering 30%apr. To this I mostly agreed as the market is effectively just the manifestation of [the wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd) with the only caveat being that there must be no informational asymmetry for the market price to be reasonably accurate.\n\nOk, so here we clearly have a strong case that the points which YT-eETH yields me will one day be worth basically what I paid it for. Cool, but if true, I'm not really making any money on this bet then. Except, that's only true if all points are equal. But you may recall from yesterday's post that I included a small wallet multiplier. Why? Because most airdrops have some form of tier system or quadratic distribution curve where points or TVL are disproportionately worth more to small wallets when compared to whales. **This is not priced into the price of YT-eETH**. YT-eETH is valued on the assumption that tokens are issued based on points pro-rata (1:1 regardless of wallet size). It has to be. So by buying YT-eETH in non-whale amounts, you're basically going long on EtherFi doing a tier based drop. You're taking extra yield away from whales who are either going long on points via YT-eETH or who simply hold vast quantities of eETH.\n\nSo will EtherFi do a tiered airdrop? Well they seem to actively engage with the community and they seem to care about their reputation within the Ethereum community and the best way to please the masses is to give them an advantage over the faceless whales. I can tell you from personal experience that the airdrops which are pro-rata have almost consistently been the most disappointing ones. *Oh, I got 12 OP in Optimism's round 2 airdrop? Whatever. Oh wow, I got $10 of Hop tokens woooooowwweeeee!!!!* On the other hand, paying $10 in fees for one Uniswap swap and getting $1,200 in return? Or $3,000 for moving 1 ETH ($300 at the time) on Tornado Cash? Fuck yeah, now we're talking! Consequently, I have been much more vocal in my support for Tornado Cash (to the point of sending Roman and co 0.1 ETH for their legal troubles) and (until lately) Uniswap. On the other hand I have hardly touched Hop since. I find it hard to imagine EtherFi rugging most of their community who have either:\n\n- a) Only got a small amount of funds\n\nor\n\n- b) Have split their funds between multiple wallets out of maximising airdrop yield.\n\nOf course, this is also wishful thinking.
