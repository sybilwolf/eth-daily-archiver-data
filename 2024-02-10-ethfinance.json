I know it's a different beast entirely in several key ways, but the game theory is very similar.\n\nIt's some extra configuration that you do as a staker which brings you extra income on top of the vanilla staking rewards, at the cost of adding centralized points of failure to the system. Just like EigenLayer.\n\n(Yes yes, they're different in that MEV-Boost is neutral middleware leading to an intentionally-isolated centralized PBS ecosystem, and the risk profile is different, and you don't have to set your withdrawal address to something else, etc. etc.)\n\nBut my point is that MEV-Boost has **at least a 90% market share**. That's the power of extra yield.\n\nIf EigenLayer truly works as they say it will, and lets stakers increase their APY significantly without a correspondingly significant increase in their risk of slashing (which does remain to be seen, granted), then I can't see how the exact same thing won't happen. It *will* end up with a 90% market share; the incentives don't really allow any other outcome. Stakers must be assumed to be fundamentally greedy and acting in their own best interest; that's how cryptoeconomic systems work. \n\nSo to me, the question is more, how does restaking fit into the Ethereum protocol's long-term plans? In MEV-Boost's case, it's very clearly a transitional piece of software that is in use while we work on our full in-protocol PBS implementation. It has a context in protocol development.\n\nWith EigenLayer, I haven't seen any such discussion/push from the core devs and researchers, though maybe I just missed it. Thus far, they have seemed content to let it remain an out-of-protocol option for stakers, with no longterm plan for how restaking could be supported in-protocol.\n\nIt's this gap in the roadmap that EigenLayer has seen and is targeting when they say they don't plan to self-limit. They *know* the incentives will be such that almost all stakers will be using their system within a few years, and are expecting that this will force the researchers and devs' hands in figuring out how to incorporate EigenLayer into the protocol.\n\nThis might seem like an attack at first glance, but after thinking about it, I conclude that it's kind of the *only* path for EigenLayer. Either they don't launch and someone else does instead, or they launch knowing they will get massive market adoption, with no plans to try to integrate with the core protocol, or they launch making those plans to integrate. I'm glad they're taking the latter route, and not planning to exist as an independent protocol on top of Ethereum indefinitely; *that* would be the case where I would be deeply concerned about centralization.\n\nBasically EigenLayer is calling the bluff that Ethereum doesn't need to think about restaking in-protocol. \n\nNow, I fully agree that there are risks to restaking that we haven't properly assessed yet, but it is unfortunately obvious to me that we will be finding out all about those risks live, in production. The implementation will have leapfrogged the research. We can (and should) shout out those possible risks, but with the kind of increased yields that may be possible, I really don't see any other outcome than massive adoption of restaking via EigenLayer, and the Ethereum community and protocol simply needing to catch up to that new reality as fast as it can.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As always, glad to have you around and keeping an eye on beacon chain health!</p>\n\n<p>To me, one of the closest parallels for EigenLayer is MEV-Boost.

And on top of that, the risk *seems* lower to just stay on Geth.\n\nBut we all know that there's no difference whether the supermajority client is at 66% or at 90%. A bad block will finalize immeiately, and stakers will lose their stake. Most people on Ethfinance are aware of that.\n\nThe risk is the same... right? Well, no.\n\nSo, here's my idea. I think that, if you believe in the dynamics of \"Layer 0\", **a 66% supermajority is much, *much* worse than a 90% supermajority for stakers running the supermajority client.**\n\nAt 90% supermajority, I can easily see the community deciding on either a rollback (yeah, yeah, I know, never again, code is law etc., but let's be realistic) or accepting the Geth block as the correct one and going forward from there, either with some kind of compensation for Nethermind/Besu clients, or even no compensation.\n\nAt 90% supermajority, there would be little discussion and it's clear to me what would happen. And it's clearer the higher the Geth dominance is.\n\nHowever, I think that at 66% things would be way more messier and contentious. This is now the \"danger zone\" where enough of the community did the right thing and have a strong enough voice, that the outcome of a supermajority client bug will be respected. *This* is where Geth users find themselves losing their stake.\n\nAnd they might have a much more quiet voice than they expect. Centralized staking services, which are the ones that are mostly refusing to do the right thing (I'm looking at you, Coinbase and Binance) will just lose someone else's money, not their own. They got their cut on your profits, they lost your stake, c'est la vie. There might be some lawsuits, they are used to that.\n\n**Change your clients. We are far from dealing with this and the situation is still critical.**\n\n*Sidenote: I'm very much a layman (albeit a staking one), so I'd like some input if my thinking is wrong.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So, I&#39;ve had an idea about client diversity (and how to push more people to switch clients).</p>\n\n<p>See, we are right now in a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; situation, where people CBA to switch from Geth because its usage is falling anyways, so someone else will do it, right?</p>\n\n<p>Plus, psychologically, a 72% Geth dominance looks <em>way</em> better than a 85% Geth dominance. And on top of that, the risk <em>seems</em> lower to just stay on Geth.</p>\n\n<p>But we all know that there&#39;s no difference whether the supermajority client is at 66% or at 90%. A bad block will finalize immeiately, and stakers will lose their stake. Most people on Ethfinance are aware of that.</p>\n\n<p>The risk is the same... right? Well, no.</p>\n\n<p>So, here&#39;s my idea. I think that, if you believe in the dynamics of &quot;Layer 0&quot;, <strong>a 66% supermajority is much, <em>much</em> worse than a 90% supermajority for stakers running the supermajority client.</strong></p>\n\n<p>At 90% supermajority, I can easily see the community deciding on either a rollback (yeah, yeah, I know, never again, code is law etc., but let&#39;s be realistic) or accepting the Geth block as the correct one and going forward from there, either with some kind of compensation for Nethermind/Besu clients, or even no compensation.</p>\n\n<p>At 90% supermajority, there would be little discussion and it&#39;s clear to me what would happen. And it&#39;s clearer the higher the Geth dominance is.</p>\n\n<p>However, I think that at 66% things would be way more messier and contentious. This is now the &quot;danger zone&quot; where enough of the community did the right thing and have a strong enough voice, that the outcome of a supermajority client bug will be respected. <em>This</em> is where Geth users find themselves losing their stake.</p>\n\n<p>And they might have a much more quiet voice than they expect.
