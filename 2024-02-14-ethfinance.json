If an airdrop is your sole purpose for using a product, then be prepared to be disappointed. I don&#39;t think they owe us anything, and we should be grateful for the free money in case we got some.  </p>\n\n<p>If I put myself in their shoes, my goal is to maximize the reward of my investors and settle the debt of many hours of hard work put in by my team, the devs, and everyone involved in developing the project. I also need to make sure my treasury is secured for many years to come, and it&#39;s only possible if I lock the majority of tokens, which is becoming a norm nowadays. Look at Arbitrum, Optimism, Celestia, and so on. But still, I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong here. How is maximizing profit wrong? Isn&#39;t this the goal of most of us here\u2014financial independence? At the same time, as a user, you have the freedom to consume the product or not. </p>\n\n<p>I use Starknet because their wallet UX is much better, games like Influence are trying to bridge the gap between blockchain and gaming, which motivates me to use their chain. Similarly, I spend an unhealthy amount of time on Optimism Gov because of their alignment towards funding public goods, and I really love Scroll for their head-down build attitude. In my opinion, just use a product or service you like, support them if you can; an airdrop is just an added flavor. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, when staking a single token and doing three transactions could earn you four-digit free money, I don&#39;t think airdrop farming will stop anytime soon, and Starknet choosing not to integrate any kind of POH tools to filter a user from bot shows their priority.</p>\n\n<p>But I want to focus on good, all the keyboard worriers complaining on X has a fish memory anyway, solo stakers, core contributes, both ehtereum and starknet, are included and I hope to see this trend evolve more in many other airdrop to come.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-14 14:00:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kqg3lfo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1aqfvsu","parent_id":"t3_1aqfvsu","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Savage_X","body":"There is a billion dollars going out.
