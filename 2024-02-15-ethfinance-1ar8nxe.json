Let's forget about the Starkware airdrop for a bit and simplify with a different potential airdrop design.\n\nProtocol X wants to reward ETH stakers. They want to reward individual validating node operators (like Solo stakers and Rocketpool node operators) 5x more than pool stakers. For simplicity there is no limitation or multiplier for being an early staker.\n\nLet's say all solo validators get 600 tokens and central exchanges / pooled stakers get 120 tokens.\n\nTo simplify, I'll only talk about 16ETH minipools. In that case a Rocketpool minipool that is run by an individual would get 600 tokens. Half of the ETH belongs to the node operator and half of the ETH belongs to the pool. There are 600 tokens to divide. Distributed in the same 5:1 way, that would mean\n\n* 500 tokens go to the minipool operator\n* 100 tokens are divided between the holders of the 16 pooled ETH.\n\nThat would mean that node operators get 500 per 16 ETH, or 1000 tokens per 32 ETH.

This is apparently important because a 19b-4 approval requires *explicit* SEC approval, whereas the current ETH futures ETFs did NOT. And because those two BTC futures ETFs DID get that *explicit* SEC approval, it basically forced the SEC to also approve the spot ETFs (this was the crux of the Grayscale lawsuit, which specifically pointed to how the SEC approved those two 19b-4 BTC futures ETFs).

The test looked at the past 2.5 years. I've heard people speculate that this test may work against ETH (and may have deliberately been designed this way), because ETH futures only came out ~3 years ago, and initial liquidity was quite bad. So it's very possible that correlations between spot and futures were not great in those early days of the futures contracts, and thus ETH would fail to pass this (arbitrary) test.\n\n4) You can argue whether or not you think ETH is a security, but it was the first ICO, which certainly *feels* like a security offering in many ways. Whereas everyone agrees that BTC is not a security. So the SEC might be worried that approving an ETH ETF might be opening pandora's box in the form of a wave of crypto ETF applications for all sorts of tokens.
