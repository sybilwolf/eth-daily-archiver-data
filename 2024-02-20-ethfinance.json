I am definitely far away from normal FIRE numbers for my country. But I have a very minimal lifestyle which brings down my cost of living quite a bit even though I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world. In the last bull run I sold enough to live off for some time and I quit my job. The goal was to be without a regular job for a year to see if actually like such an arrangement. After one year I extended it for another year with plans to have some continuous income until the next bull run. Last autumn I decided to stay the course. I am without a regular job for 2.5 years now and I love it. But this kind of arrangement is not for everyone. Some people need more structure in their life or they loose all drive. You most probably need something which gives you a sense of purpose which makes you get up in the morning. Getting rid of a stressful grindy job does not make you a well balanced and happy person automatically. Maybe it makes sense for you as well to test it first for a year or so if it is something for you. Not having a regular job does not mean you have no additional income. Depending on your skills and motivation you might pick up something you like and pursue it.\n\nFor me it is perfect as I spend a lot more time with my family and nephew. I write code I actually like to write. I am involved in projects I actually believe in or have a lot of fun doing. Sometimes I get paid, sometimes not. Sometimes I get airdrops, sometimes not. Together with the staking income it is enough to sustain me.\n\nI plan to diversify much more in the coming years. If there is one thing I learned in the last years in the space no APY is guaranteed.

I am definitely far away from normal FIRE numbers for my country. But I have a very minimal lifestyle which brings down my cost of living quite a bit even though I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world. In the last bull run I sold enough to live off for some time and I quit my job. The goal was to be without a regular job for a year to see if actually like such an arrangement. After one year I extended it for another year with plans to have some continuous income until the next bull run. Last autumn I decided to stay the course. I am without a regular job for 2.5 years now and I love it. But this kind of arrangement is not for everyone. Some people need more structure in their life or they loose all drive. You most probably need something which gives you a sense of purpose which makes you get up in the morning. Getting rid of a stressful grindy job does not make you a well balanced and happy person automatically. Maybe it makes sense for you as well to test it first for a year or so if it is something for you. Not having a regular job does not mean you have no additional income. Depending on your skills and motivation you might pick up something you like and pursue it.</p>\n\n<p>For me it is perfect as I spend a lot more time with my family and nephew.
