So, I minted the NFT. And I am sure I did the right thing.\n\nThe 0.15 ETH NFT price-tag is.. a bit steep imo, however what u/tricky_troll said (slightly paraphrased) about 10 days ago, has stuck in my head: \"these guys once gave me thousands of dollars.. it's my time to help now\". I did indeed get way more than 0.15 ETH on the TC airdrop. The least I can do is give a little bit back..\n\nEven if you never got a cent from that airdrop, I believe it is very important that we, as a community support this..","body_html":"<div
