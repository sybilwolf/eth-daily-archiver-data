It's november 2016. My girlfriend back then, now my wife, invited her best friends at our house for a brunch. I wasn't that excited and even wanted to cancel it, was feeling a little sick but I didn't want to ruin it for my gf so I did it anyway. Boyfriends were also invited.\n\nSo we started brunching and I had a hard time being social. The guy next to me started talking to me. About life, about work and investing. At that time it was not my cup of tea. He talked about stocks, real estate, gold,... I had a hard time to follow. Suddenly he asks if I know something about crypto. I said no. He explained the concept of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Suddenly he had my attention. \n\nI've always been kinda anti governments, powers and our system the way it is run. This sounded amazing. Music to my ears. He showed his coinbase app and said if you install it now I can send you some. It is very fast. I installed it on my phone and he transferred 0.5 ETH to me (+- 5 dollar at that time). I quickly received it and was hooked. When everybody left I instantly read the whitepaper and was even more hooked. This is it, this is it I said to myself. \nNext day I transferred an amount of money to Coinbase and bought Ethereum.\n\nFast forward to today. I still have that 0.5 ETH (and the ETH that i bought the day after) that I received on that brunch. I booked a table for 2 at a 3 star Michelin restaurant for me and that guy. I will pay everything (with that 0.5 ETH) for him as a thank you. \n\nSometimes I wonder what if? What if I cancelled that brunch? That guy has changed my life so much. It's crazy how small things, small actions or decisions can have such an impact on your or our lifes. \n\nAlso want to thank this community (+ethtrader back then) for the good info, conversations and keeping me on track. You have to be lucky but also need some discipline and perseverance. \n\nThanks","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A little memoire for those that are interested. It&#39;s november 2016. My girlfriend back then, now my wife, invited her best friends at our house for a brunch. I wasn&#39;t that excited and even wanted to cancel it, was feeling a little sick but I didn&#39;t want to ruin it for my gf so I did it anyway. Boyfriends were also invited.</p>\n\n<p>So we started brunching and I had a hard time being social. The guy next to me started talking to me. About life, about work and investing. At that time it was not my cup of tea. He talked about stocks, real estate, gold,... I had a hard time to follow. Suddenly he asks if I know something about crypto. I said no. He explained the concept of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Suddenly he had my attention. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always been kinda anti governments, powers and our system the way it is run. This sounded amazing. Music to my ears. He showed his coinbase app and said if you install it now I can send you some. It is very fast. I installed it on my phone and he transferred 0.5 ETH to me (+- 5 dollar at that time). I quickly received it and was hooked. When everybody left I instantly read the whitepaper and was even more hooked. This is it, this is it I said to myself. \nNext day I transferred an amount of money to Coinbase and bought Ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today. I still have that 0.5 ETH (and the ETH that i bought the day after) that I received on that brunch. I booked a table for 2 at a 3 star Michelin restaurant for me and that guy. I will pay everything (with that 0.5 ETH) for him as a thank you. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I wonder what if? What if I cancelled that brunch? That guy has changed my life so much. It&#39;s crazy how small things, small actions or decisions can have such an impact on your or our lifes. </p>\n\n<p>Also want to thank this community (+ethtrader back then) for the good info, conversations and keeping me on track. You have to be lucky but also need some discipline and perseverance. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-27 14:21:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ksg14cb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1b14ls9","parent_id":"t3_1b14ls9","score":90,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tom_The_Moose","body":"I had a friend at work who did something similar.

I haven't spent a ton of time with the details of consensus algorithms outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, so talked with the speaker for a while after the talk.

Their flatcoin is called UNIT, and is backed by rETH. I think (from my reading after the talk) that you deposit rETH, which gets matched with the short side of an rETH perpetual futures contract to create a delta-neutral position. The long side of the rETH perpetual futures contract is held by leverage traders, who borrow rETH from the pool for margin.

Maybe next year.\n* [Vikram Arun, Co-Founder at Superform and ERC-4626 Alliance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSVC4GA3aVg) explained how to implement ERC-4626 compliant contracts. This standard defines a set of functions for a contract to operate as a vault. These are generally yield-bearing contracts that allow deposits and withdrawals from numerous parties, Yearn being the obvious example. The hope is that the standardization can make vaults safer and encourage widespread development. Most of the talk was targeted at developers, explaining how to actually implement the functions, and what limitations to expect. Superform is a platform that acts as a frontend to any ERC-4626-compliant vault.\n* [Slava Serebrianniy, Developer Relations Lead at Fireblocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqe19RkMakI) expects many companies to need to hire \"Blockchain Architects\". Contrary to what the name implies (to me, at least), these are not people who architect blockchains, but rather the people who are \"responsible for high level design, strategic planning, and tech decisions for blockchain products\". So an architect for all the supporting services, security considerations, and integrations that go into a large scale blockchain-using project.\n* [Kev Silk, Senior Product Manager at Ankr (Pronounced like anchor)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee6RLuq-myE) talked about Ankr Verify, which is a system for ZKP-based identity verification. You send pictures of your passport and birth certificate, etc, to their KYC partner Synaps, who stores them securely and issues your \"digital ID\". Then you can make requests to Ankr Verify, which will have Synaps generate a zero-knowledge proof in response to specific questions, e.g. \"is this person over the age of 16\", without revealing any other information.
