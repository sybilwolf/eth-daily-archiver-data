The main argument was that if you're just mixing and matching existing modular components, your rollup isn't going to end up with any interesting technical advantage over anyone else's rollup. Modularity trades sovereignty for speed of development, and leads to commodification. I think this kind of assumes that the future is a small number of relevant rollups competing on technical differences (something I tend to believe as well), in which case yeah, you're not going to build a better Optimism by copying their stack. If you're instead a believer in a future of a million app-specific rollups, then modular is probably more relevant.\n* [Murat Akdeniz, Founder of Primev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXRZcsl6Le4) had a scheduling mixup: the person after him presented during his slot or something. I wanted to see this but the scheduling mixup caused a conflict with another talk I wanted to see, so I had to take off. Fortunately I managed to chat with Murat a bit later in the day; he's presenting the same thing at the Titan MEV event tomorrow and there's some interesting relay discussion to be had later as well.\n* [Margaux Nijkerk of CoinDesk hosted a panel on client diversity with Danno Ferrin of Besu, u/nixorokish of EthStaker, lightclient of geth, and Darren Langley of Rocket Pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UTUsZA_d_E). Common topic here, but a few quick notes. Big emphasis on stateless Ethereum as a way to address this problem: if nodes become trivial to run, it's less of a big deal to play with or multiplex different clients. Langers pointed out three ways to combat the issue that he thinks RP is doing a good job at: transparency, education/support, and making it easy to switch clients. Block graffiti will contain EL client at some point, but there are issues with that too.\n* [Tiancheng Xie, CTO & Co-founder of Polyhedra Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5zdmGNegnQ) shared his research on zero knowledge proofs and single slot finality. It was a very technical talk. The main product is a new compiler, \"Log Compiler\", which somehow identifies sub-circuits, maybe taking advantage of repetition to improve efficiency. In addition, they have a bi-variate KZG which replaces a FFT step and achieves O(1) communication between machines. Ethereum finality is in some ways limited by the need to divide validators across slots in an epoch; a zk signature proof to reduce overhead could be a pathway to faster finality.\n* [Jan Gorzny, Technical Lead at Zircuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbfiF4kEbnU) talked about the experience of building a ZK rollup on the OP stack. The OP infrastructure is not very general purpose so it took a lot of work: the sequencer injects \"system transactions\" into each block which need to be proven, fraud proofs and bridges aren't modular, and deposit transactions needed fundamental changes. It sounded like a *lot* of problems. I'm honestly not sure why they didn't just scrap the whole thing and start zk from the ground up.\n* [Nick Dodson, CEO of Fuel Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDPzvcENv0w) pulled a fast one on us, changing their talk from \"solving state growth\" to \"fast finality optimistic rollups\". The window for fraud proof submission needs to be long to be able to outlast possible censorship attacks, but plenty of research on setting the window to default short and extend if there are signs of censorship. In their system, a set of validators \"check in\" every epoch. If all of them do, the L2 state can be finalized quickly. If even one doesn't check in, could be fraud or censorship, so extend the window.\n* [Matt Cutler, CEO of Blocknative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiECPjIpcFk) presented [Ethernow](https://www.ethernow.xyz/), Blocknative's tool for real-time Ethereum observability: what's happening on Ethereum *right now*? There are actors like relays and builders who have a ton of power, and tools to watch their moves closely helps stop them from abusing their powers (if they think there's a higher chance of getting caught!). Ethernow has some overall metrics, but maybe more interestingly lets you trace the journey of a transaction through the entire pipeline (which has grown exceedingly complex).\n* [Jacob Creech, Head of Developer Relations at The Solana Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slVrfXAwF5k) boldly made the case for Solana while surrounded by Ethereum fans and imagery. High level overview, described Solana's goal as \"decentralized platform for user friendly apps at scale\". Uses parallel execution with local fee markets (which I finally grokked today), has upcoming Firedancer client which is supposedly so optimized that it can saturate a 25 GB NIC. Offered suggestions of use cases that only work on Solana, which were exclusively due to Solana being fast and cheap and probably would work nearly as well on a rollup.\n* [MacKenzie Sigalos, Correspondent at CNBC, interviewed Hester Peirce, Commissioner at the SEC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gbwrn3PR5U).

If you scroll down a bit here: [https://etfs.grayscale.com/gbtc](https://etfs.grayscale.com/gbtc) you can see how much Grayscale holds in BTC, which as of now is 438,208.9475 BTC. At current market prices, that's \\~27b. Yesterday was their largest sell off day, which was around \\~600m. The BTC market still went up.\n\nLet's say GBTC clients keep selling around 500m a day, which would be huge outflows for them, and on the flip side, Blackrock clients buy their BTC 1:1, as they have been (they've been outbuying them in general, but yesterday was close to a 1:1 trade). That trade would last around 54 days, assuming GBTC wants to sell ALL of their BTC, non-stop daily, and all other market conditions are neutral (they're not).\n\nWhat am I getting at? Grayscale is selling pretty heavily right now as Blackrock and Fidelity accumulates basically all of it? And they can't do it for much longer at these prices. And at what point do they become buyers again and what does THAT do to the market since they seem to be the only big seller at the moment? Retail isn't even factored into any of this.

I don't think ETH ETFs will have the same demand as BTC ETFs, and they need to get approved as well, which isn't a guarantee. But, if ETH ETFs do get approved and lets say the demand is 10% of BTCs, then Grayscale would run out of ETH in 200 days, or half in 100 (at current prices).
