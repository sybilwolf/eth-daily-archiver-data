There were only two really MEV/relay/staking (not restaking) oriented events I saw planned, and both were today with significant overlap. A little awkward, but fine. Nice to get a change of scenery for once. Starting to feel a little worn out, but I think getting to day 7 before feeling it is actually better than usual actually? Maybe I should set aside an hour to jam out on the rhythm game arcade machines tomorrow \u250c(\uff3e\uff3e)\u2518\u266a\u266c\u266b.\n\nTitan (who operates a builder and (recently) a relay) and HashKey hosted one of the events, called \"Beyond the Block: MEV Along the Txn Supply Chain\". The title is a good summary, actually, and the event drew people from the searcher/solver/builder/etc world who your average home staker may not know about. Good deep dives into important but niche MEV topics. BloXroute and EthStaker hosted the second event, titled \"Ethereum Validator and Node Summit\", which drew the crowds I'm more familiar with. Some really good panels, and a lot of BloXroute marketing. I don't know if these were recorded, probably not, so no video links.\n\nThanks u/llamachef for [a great writeup today](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1b3n2y3/daily_general_discussion_march_1_2024/ksx6mu5/). Sorry I missed you at the event today. I'm pretty sure when we finally shake hands I'll recognize you and say \"oh, you're *that* guy who I've seen everywhere already\".\n\n* Angela Lu of Flashbots laid out the current order flow landscape. The common model of users->searchers->builders is an oversimplification. In many systems, user intents are filled by solvers who optimize routing, with market makers provide their own liquidity, and the resulting transactions are sent to an RPC like MEV Blocker which runs its own auction for backrunning rights and does some reimbursement, then finally gets handed off to a builder for merging. She gave one example of a swap that ended up involving *75 different entities* in its journey to get on chain.\n* Danning Sui of Flashbots explained the trend of builder subsidies. Basically, builders cann't attract private order flow unless they demonstrate they can consistently win slots, but can't win a lot of slots without already having private order flow. So they subsidize their blocks, paying out of pocket to win mev-boost auctions so they can bootstrap their way into the market. But even big builders seem to be doing this, possibly as a way to maintain their market share. Flashbots did an analysis of the slots their builder lost, interesting to see if it was due to lack of order flow, subsidies by the winning builder, or long latency.\n* Max Resnick of Special Mechanisms Group provided a structural analysis of MEV-Boost auctions. Builder bids are not necessarily reflective of the value of the block to the builder; the bids are influenced by their bidding strategies. So they tried to create a model to estimate true block value. They found integrated (searcher+builder) builders' bids were more responsive to CEX price movement than non-integrated builders', and the integrated builders ended up with a higher mean bid and lower variance. Given that advantage, economics literature would suggest that a sealed first price auction would be more efficient than the current structure.\n* I was multitasking during a talk on preconfirmations. This is an emerging area where the hope is that a block proposer can confirm to a tx submitter, long before the block is proposed, that their tx will definitely be included in the block. There are some uses cases (e.g. helps with atomic L2 composability and cross-rollup MEV), and a potentially lucrative market, for these preconfirmations. Very much a work in progress.\n* Mike Neuder of the EF presented on execution tickets. Not the first time this has been discussed, see [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/t/execution-tickets/17944). In short. Pros: validators don't need to play timing games, mev-burn comes out of the box so MEV no longer messes with reward curves, and proposers can still build inclusion lists to contrain builders. Cons: it's easier for a single builder to buy many slots in a row and maximize multi-slot MEV, it requires accepting centralized sets of builders and ticket-traders, and it's a major overhaul with a lot of unknown unknowns.\n* At the Node and Validator Summit, u/nixorokish hosted a panel on client diversity with Ben Rodriguez of Coinbase, Jasper of Rocket Pool community fame, Colton Campbell of Figment, Alessandro Maxi of P2P, and Josh Klopfenstein of Nethermind.

There were only two really MEV/relay/staking (not restaking) oriented events I saw planned, and both were today with significant overlap. A little awkward, but fine. Nice to get a change of scenery for once. Starting to feel a little worn out, but I think getting to day 7 before feeling it is actually better than usual actually? Maybe I should set aside an hour to jam out on the rhythm game arcade machines tomorrow \u250c(\uff3e\uff3e)\u2518\u266a\u266c\u266b.</p>\n\n<p>Titan (who operates a builder and (recently) a relay) and HashKey hosted one of the events, called &quot;Beyond the Block: MEV Along the Txn Supply Chain&quot;. The title is a good summary, actually, and the event drew people from the searcher/solver/builder/etc world who your average home staker may not know about. Good deep dives into important but niche MEV topics. BloXroute and EthStaker hosted the second event, titled &quot;Ethereum Validator and Node Summit&quot;, which drew the crowds I&#39;m more familiar with. Some really good panels, and a lot of BloXroute marketing. I don&#39;t know if these were recorded, probably not, so no video links.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"/u/llamachef\">u/llamachef</a> for <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1b3n2y3/daily_general_discussion_march_1_2024/ksx6mu5/\">a great writeup today</a>. Sorry I missed you at the event today. I&#39;m pretty sure when we finally shake hands I&#39;ll recognize you and say &quot;oh, you&#39;re <em>that</em> guy who I&#39;ve seen everywhere already&quot;.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Angela Lu of Flashbots laid out the current order flow landscape. The common model of users-&gt;searchers-&gt;builders is an oversimplification. In many systems, user intents are filled by solvers who optimize routing, with market makers provide their own liquidity, and the resulting transactions are sent to an RPC like MEV Blocker which runs its own auction for backrunning rights and does some reimbursement, then finally gets handed off to a builder for merging. She gave one example of a swap that ended up involving <em>75 different entities</em> in its journey to get on chain.</li>\n<li>Danning Sui of Flashbots explained the trend of builder subsidies. Basically, builders cann&#39;t attract private order flow unless they demonstrate they can consistently win slots, but can&#39;t win a lot of slots without already having private order flow. So they subsidize their blocks, paying out of pocket to win mev-boost auctions so they can bootstrap their way into the market. But even big builders seem to be doing this, possibly as a way to maintain their market share. Flashbots did an analysis of the slots their builder lost, interesting to see if it was due to lack of order flow, subsidies by the winning builder, or long latency.</li>\n<li>Max Resnick of Special Mechanisms Group provided a structural analysis of MEV-Boost auctions. Builder bids are not necessarily reflective of the value of the block to the builder; the bids are influenced by their bidding strategies. So they tried to create a model to estimate true block value. They found integrated (searcher+builder) builders&#39; bids were more responsive to CEX price movement than non-integrated builders&#39;, and the integrated builders ended up with a higher mean bid and lower variance. Given that advantage, economics literature would suggest that a sealed first price auction would be more efficient than the current structure.</li>\n<li>I was multitasking during a talk on preconfirmations. This is an emerging area where the hope is that a block proposer can confirm to a tx submitter, long before the block is proposed, that their tx will definitely be included in the block. There are some uses cases (e.g. helps with atomic L2 composability and cross-rollup MEV), and a potentially lucrative market, for these preconfirmations. Very much a work in progress.</li>\n<li>Mike Neuder of the EF presented on execution tickets. Not the first time this has been discussed, see <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/execution-tickets/17944\">ethresear.ch</a>. In short. Pros: validators don&#39;t need to play timing games, mev-burn comes out of the box so MEV no longer messes with reward curves, and proposers can still build inclusion lists to contrain builders. Cons: it&#39;s easier for a single builder to buy many slots in a row and maximize multi-slot MEV, it requires accepting centralized sets of builders and ticket-traders, and it&#39;s a major overhaul with a lot of unknown unknowns.</li>\n<li>At the Node and Validator Summit, <a href=\"/u/nixorokish\">u/nixorokish</a> hosted a panel on client diversity with Ben Rodriguez of Coinbase, Jasper of Rocket Pool community fame, Colton Campbell of Figment, Alessandro Maxi of P2P, and Josh Klopfenstein of Nethermind.

Reviewed call data for L2s vs blobs with a fee market and 6 blobs per block. Discussed structure, from availability to provers. Went over the vector math verifying blobs (uses the KZG stuff and other math wizardry). Showed the current proving architecture, and the upcoming one for 4844 of batching aggregations then batching blobs before STARK to SNARK stage. The team has created a new code processor to accomplish all this zkEVM and blob magic.

Austin Griffith if BUIDL GUIDL talked about his coding history and transition to eth infrastructure, such as speedrunethereum, and that your first coding ventures will suck but don't give up. Justin Moskowitz of EthDenver discussed the course built with University of Eth that should take 15 hours to intro folks into the ecosystem (it took me 3 I think while listening to these panels).\u00a0 He also talked with each panelist about how they saw developments at this EthDenver and how to integrate them with their projects.\u00a0\n\n\n\"L1s vs. Rollups (zkVM vs. zkEVM)\" panel hosted by Joanna Zeng of Aleo, with Alex Gluchowski of Matter Labs, Zac Williamson of Aztec, Alex Pruden of Aleo, and Brendan Farmer of Polygon Zero. A talk on solving privacy versus solving scalability. Related current efforts to the movement of the Internet from http to https. zkEVMs provide the verification of computation, and can use a roll up for privacy. Alex of Aleo countered that the blob accompanying a ZK privacy roll-up is not as secure (I missed the exact language used as to why, probably because it starts from an unprivate device and connection). They dove into their ZK approaches as defined by Vitalik, like ZK going type 4 of starting from the compiled code on a device. Potential eth ZK for every phone to be a full node.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Farcaster Fever: What People Are Building on Web3 Social's New Hit\" panel. A lot of development in the past two years that started from nothing, leading now to the new hotness of Frames on Farcaster (I have an account but haven't used it really). Frames is trying to make web3 crypto-ness obscured for ease of use by all, in a similar way to how folks used to have Farmville and all those other things you used to have on your Facebook feed. Base spun up some new cool Frames as a proof on concept and is building contracts in the backend to cover gas, such as buying girl scout cookies. Frames puts more control in the hands of users of what they see versus discord and telegram constant feed, and companies are able to leverage frames to quickly engage with users in a manner appropriate to all of our modern attention span. Potential to be like WeChat, combining chat, feeds, banking, shopping, social media, etc all in one platform that also lets users fully control their privacy and data versus the industry holding all that without users fully knowing what they know. They all see a bright future for it. Guess I'll have to try and engage more with it\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe EthDenver official wallet, Clave, which is ZK powered and has the BUIDL tokens for buying stuff and all, stopped working for me today. I set it up quick the first day here and used the built in android passkey, and now apparently that's glitching. They said they're working on it. They pushed an update later that fixed it.\n\n\nThe ENS booth had their POAP badge generation up today, got to get a badge with your ENS name and PFP on it, and if you tap it you can get a POAP (I think) and also loads some links, like contact over one of the xmtp apps like Coinbase wallet associated with your ENS.\u00a0\n\n\nAkash is a project to provide your spare GPU power to be rented on chain for any project that needs it, ala Stablehorde or other projects, but with on chain reputation and the like built in.\u00a0\n\n\nXdc was the group from my post yesterday about a new EVM L1 that's both open and permissioned for business.\n\n\nExponential.fi had a booth, still looking into what they do (they seem like a bank account but mention defi).

Reviewed call data for L2s vs blobs with a fee market and 6 blobs per block. Discussed structure, from availability to provers. Went over the vector math verifying blobs (uses the KZG stuff and other math wizardry). Showed the current proving architecture, and the upcoming one for 4844 of batching aggregations then batching blobs before STARK to SNARK stage.
