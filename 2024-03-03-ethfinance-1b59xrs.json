I spent basically the whole day at the [Rocket Pool Lift-Off side event](https://tokenproof.xyz/event/denver-lift-off). I got involved helping as a teaching assistant for some of their \"new validator workshops\". But even though hundreds of attendees registered, I think in total across like 6 separate sessions, there were maybe 20 new folks who showed up? They were definitely outnumbered by the Rocket Pool regulars who were just there to hang out. I helped assist teaching a little during the first session then was useless in the second and ultimately figured there was no point in me being on alert for teaching opportunities and ended up socializing.\n\nAccording to the website, the event is hosted by the Rocket Pool pDAO, and I know [Ken put in a lot of work](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/denver-lift-off-a-rocket-pool-convention/2511) to try to organize this, but I don't quite know who else contributed to the massive amount of work needed to pull this off. The venue was nice, think that would be a good spot for future events as well. But this is otherwise one of the biggest days of ETHDenver as a whole, not the best time to schedule a large side event. That certainly didn't help attendance. Overall it's a two day event, so the fun continues tomorrow with a more strucured talk-based format. But clearly there is some room for improvement next time, and I hope everyone agrees that this is a good enough proof of concept to justify a \"next time\".\n\nLater in the day there was a \"Rocket Pool Community Discussion\" hosted by ShfRyn. We packed a good amount of people (guessing, maybe 50?) into a small classroom, split into 5 breakout groups, and went through a number of prompts. We discussed each within our group, then had our team leader share a summary with the class. The prompts got us to think about RP's strengths, weaknesses, future opportunities, etc. In my group, u/jtnichol made for a good team lead, u/spacesider contributed well despite not actually being an RP node operator, we bullied u/yspud into posting on r/ethfinance, u/KuDeTa joined later and provided good insights but kept distracting me with important relay-related questions, and I didn't get everyone else's reddit names. We were a pretty competent group, not as clever as the super-group that had u/waqwaqattack, u/logristhebard, and jasperthefriendlyghost (among others), but we made some good suggestions here and there.\n\nAnd that was basically the whole day. Not going to talks messed up my evening post-writing flow! Feels weird.\n\nI started thinking about tomorrow, and realized I made an oopsie. Last year I had a great time walking around the BUIDL area with (I think both) u/the-A-word and u/mtitus6 , just approaching hackathon groups during the general judging period and seeing what they were working on. Wanted to do the same thing this year, but... judging was today. I thought it would be tomorrow. So I guess I missed it. And I'm not crazy: [this was the post I made last year](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11jq6y5/daily_general_discussion_march_6_2023/jb48g07/) about hackathon projects, and it was definitely describing what I did on Sunday. Need to have a think about my plans for tomorrow. Maybe just Rocket Pool all day I guess.\n\nEDIT: As soon as I posted this, reddit decided that it had \"detected suspicious activity\" on my account and suspended it.

I&#39;ll sell the ETH for some IRL expenses in the not-too-distant future (mainly taxes). </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve held enough airdropped tokens through a whole cycle to know I won&#39;t be able to time the top, so decided $7000 was too much to leave on the table for a token I don&#39;t understand and don&#39;t have time to research. The unlock schedule was pretty brutal (~700 million airdropped with another 2 billion unlocking in ~2 months), so yes, they changed it, but the overall tokenomics don&#39;t stack up for me; 10 billion total tokens is crazy FDV in an ever expanding L2 space. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>L2s have barely pumped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Will they pump more than ETH? I trust ETH more than I trust any individual L2, so if I didn&#39;t need to sell for $ I&#39;d be holding the ETH. </p>\n\n<p>I think whatever you choose to do, make a plan.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-03 03:49:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kt4xn6l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1b59xrs","parent_id":"t1_kt4vlfk","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Wulkingdead","body":"I sold it as fast as i could for ETH, they got so much hate as well.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I sold it as fast as i could for ETH, they got so much hate as well.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-03 09:18:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kt673zj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1b59xrs","parent_id":"t1_kt4vlfk","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/timwithnotoolbelt","body":"Dumped it.
