Pushing the merge button made me feel like an actual developer.\n\nHe also forked my repository, which means it's now hosted on his[ Github](https://github.com/prestonvanloon/validator-install). That was a major boost to my confidence and Github street cred.\n\nu/hanniabu reached out and suggested adding a keystore import to the installer. I worked up a few changes and he graciously reviewed the code and provided valuable feedback.\n\nAs the client diversity stuff became popular, I created [client-switcher](https://github.com/accidental-green/client-switcher) to help people switch execution clients with a single click. It was well received and multiple people reached out saying they were able to successfully switch to a minority client.\n\nRecently u/coincashew forked my code and created their own one line installer, mentioning that because of my code they were able to write the whole thing in a single day. People were actually building off my code, and the idea of open source started to make more sense. \n\nSo what's the point in writing all this? I'm not really sure. I spent years as a silent observer of this sub, so decided it's finally time to share my story and maybe inspire someone to start that project they've been thinking about.\n\nThis hasn't been very lucrative financially, but it's nice knowing I've contributed to Ethereum and made staking a bit more accessible.

You might remember this from [Waq's comment here a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ayn9gi/daily_general_discussion_february_24_2024/krxpuj4/), which contains an overview so I don't need to do it here but happy to discuss further. I finally took the time to understand it better. Looks good, got the impression many in the audience would be happy to see this deployed today, but there's enough work that needs to be done (and EIPs that need to be included in Pectra) that it's going to be a while longer.\n* Jasper explained the role and activities of the Incentives Management Committee (IMC). Their chief mission is to support low ETH-rETH slippage, which may sound overly specific until you realize rETH is probably Rocket Pool's primary product and the whole point is for it to be liquid and maintain its peg. So they do a lot to incentivize liquidity on exchanges! I was distracted at the time and didn't catch a lot of the details.\n* Langers gave an overview of the upcoming Houston upgrade. There are a number of changes. With RPIP-33, a lot of protocol DAO (pDAO) activity gets moved on-chain: various types of proposals and voting. There would also be a Security Council which could make certain limited emergency changes without requiring a delay. Houston will allow an account to stake ETH on behalf of a given node, and separate RPL withdrawal addresses from ETH withdrawal addresses. Together these enable better trustless integration with smart contracts. Looking at Houston on May 6!\n* Daniel McCartney discussed his [Rocket Sweep tool](https://rocketsweep.app/), which monitors available node rewards and provides estimates of efficiency of the claiming operations (how much are you getting vs how much is spent on gas). It can also be used to efficiently sweep these rewards, making various optimizations here and there. It will intelligently combine operations into a smaller number of transactions (though I think you need your node or withdrawal address to be a Safe in order to do it all at once).\n* Patches went through the inner workings of the [Rescue Node](https://rescuenode.com/). As a reminder, this is available for solo stakers and RP node operators, can keep you validating if your clients need some downtime to resync or something. There's some interesting engineering around ensuring that incoming requests have been granted permission, and the correct fee recipient is used for block proposals.\n* Jasper took the podium again to imagine Rocket Pool's endgame in the context of the \"what assets make for the best money\" discussion. I appreciated taking some time to discuss upcoming fundamental Ethereum protocol changes, many of which make Rocket Pool style staking much more trustless and resilient. The talk ended with a call for everyone to get involved in the Ethereum protocol side of things. Rocket Pool as a whole can try to be an effective advocate for solo stakers to the EF and other communities, but for NOs, you need to keep informed and work to be an advocate for yourself.\n* Mike Leach (Wander) and Nick Steinhilber of NodeSet talked about their plans for Constellation, which they described as a second-layer liquid staking protocol built on top of Rocket Pool. RP has been struggling to grow, largely limited by the amount of ETH NOs are able to bond. Constellation would provide a mechanism which distributes additional capital equitably to high-quality node operators, which they would use as a bond with a large effect on overall rETH capacity. May serve as a practical medium-term solution to RP growth until bonding curve and tokenomics changes can be rolled out.\n* Yokem warned about MEV-Boost relays, and how to monitor and store data about them in order to help keep them honest. I missed this in person but actually went back to watch the stream. Got most of the way through before the stream went private. I think I caught that he has a project currently doing a lot of this data capture and storage, which could be particularly relevant if a relay starts manipulating their own historical data APIs or goes offline and no longer serves that data.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver Day 9</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1b59xrs/daily_general_discussion_march_3_2024/kt458jx/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Final day of ETHDenver.

In the beginning, it seemed like the more validators we had, the more economic security we had, and this was a good thing.\n\nAs we've progressed, we've reached a few conclusions: \n\n1. The chain is too heavy to run smoothly with too many validators. \n\n2. More money staked on the chain doesn't equate directly to economic security.\n\n3. Solo and home stakers are the minority, rather than the majority, and if current economic incentives lead, it's likely that a few entities will control the validator set, both on the Liquid Staking level AND the Liquid Restaking level.\n\nAs we near a million validators, we ought to have ever-increasing security, right? Well, it seems that the playing field is shifting, and now Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) are dominating the chain. As I've said a million times, I'm not opposed to these products, but I AM focused on the long term health and security of Ethereum, not the success of third parties who profit from the security mechanism.\n\nWhat's the job of a validator? It's to validate a view of the network and ensure our immutability and impartiality as a network. The original idea was that validator operators would be spread all over the world, that hundreds of thousands of individuals would operate validators in their homes and we'd have an extremely robust and resilient network. Because of expense or difficulty, things didn't really turn out this way, and it's estimated that only 6% of validators are solo stakers. Who is operating the other 94%? Mostly liquid staking token services, and soon to be liquid restaking token services.\n\nSo, what's my problem with LSTs and LRTs? It's two things:\n\n1. They have nothing at stake. The coins they're operating with aren't their own, and they succeed by growing as large as they can by staking Ether that belong to other people. Their fundamental allegiance isn't to Ether, but to the rewards they get from staking other people's Ether.\n\n2. In most cases, the success of the LST/LRT is in conflict with the success of Ethereum as a decentralized network. If I'm an LST entity, I make the most money when I have the most Ether staked. If I can stake 100% of the Ether on the network, I make the most money. This conflicts with Ethereum because we're working to build a decentralized staking platform that is resistant to capture. LST/LRT's who approach a majority of staked Ether are capturing the network.\n\nSo here we are. On our current trajectory, LST/LRTs are increasingly capturing the validator set, and it's all fine in the name of economic incentives, because they're playing by the rules. We're about to sit back and let third parties have more control over our network than people who actually hold Ether. Let me be clear - from an economic incentives perspective, these entities will act in their own best interest, and that's great as long as their interests are aligned with Ethereum, but what will they do when those interests diverge? (They'll act in their own interest, that's classic capture.)\n\nSo, at this point we know that entities who operate by the rules can eventually capture Ethereum, and there's nothing we can do to prevent it, right? Well, no. We need to continue to develop the network in a way that resists capture at all costs. A captured network may LOOK good, but be effectively worthless. You ought to be aware that three letter agencies and world governments are constantly monitoring cryptocurrencies and evaluating their value proposition. We can lie to investors all day long, but if we want REAL adoption, we need to acknowledge that we can't fake real decentralization.\n\nHow do we prevent capture? Well, the key is to ensure that people who hold Ether control the network, and not people who hold derivative tokens. We do this by changing the reward curve for staking to soft-limit the number of staked Ether to about 25% of the total issuance. If the validator pool exceeds 25%, then SOME kind of deterrence kicks in to reduce interest - the most obvious deterrent is negative staking rewards. As a staker, I hate this idea, but as an Etherean it makes sense to me.\n\nIf only 25% of Ether are staked, that means that 75% of the Ether are held as Ether (honestly, they'll be in defi vaults or something, but you get the idea) rather than liquid staking tokens. It means that the vast majority of the Ethereum network is controlled by Ethereans, not third party token holders.\n\nRight now, we hold a stick that says, \"If the staking layer is corrupted, we can slash those who are corrupted and restore balance.\" It sounds fine in theory, but in principal, the only time we'd ever get close to this is if a staking entity was already so large that they control the network, and to be perfectly honest, I don't ever see that kind of slash happening because it would be a near-fatal blow to everything we've built. In other words, you can't slash someone who controls more Ether than Ethereans.\n\nBut consider that only 25% of Ether are staked and the operator set becomes corrupted. It's not a far stretch for the 75% of aligned Ether holders to slash the corruption out of the validator set because it's in the best interest of Ethereum holders to guarantee the security of the validator set. In this model, if a third party entity controls 50% of the staked Ether, the people holding Ether tokens can elect to slash them, and we lose something like 6.25% of Ether in the process of ousting a bad actor. (I assume they hold 12.5% of validators and we slash them for half of their stake). This is STILL exceedingly unlikely, and I honestly think we need to develop a mechanism that makes slashing in the case of capture HIGHLY likely and not a long shot.\n\nThe summary of all of this is that we have learned lessons in the past about aggregating all of our risk in one pot. We had a devastating loss with The DAO that nearly cost us everything. We MUST learn from this lesson and not continue to aggregate large amounts of risk in contracts or entities that may blow up in our face.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I want to put some thoughts out here, I know they&#39;re going to be disorganized, I just want to put them on paper before I lose them because I can&#39;t seem to find enough quiet time to organize them properly.</p>\n\n<p>My thoughts are influenced by <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751\">this post by Caspar</a>, but obviously, I&#39;m a community member rather than an academic so that&#39;s the flavor you&#39;ll get here.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of validators on Ethereum is to provide security for the chain and its transactions.
