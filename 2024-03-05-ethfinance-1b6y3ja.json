Meaning, we see 10k not near the peak of this cycle, but as the midcycle high (yes that might sound crazy now). All of the people aching to sell at 6k, 7k, whatever isn&#39;t going to matter. Your sells will get ripped through and ETH is going to chug along to the 8-10k range before any significant mid cycle pullback (think of the larger mid-bull pullbacks, ala summer 2021 or late spring 2017). After this larger 30-50% shakeout happens, the market is going to recover and absolutely melt faces into the 10-20k range for the blowoff top of this cycle. If there are no major hacks or exploits, and as long as the ETH ETF gets approved,  we could see tradfi and the world get so drunk off what Ethereum and ETH is, especially due to staking narratives, that price could end up in the 20-30k range.</p>\n\n<p>We are still so early in this cycle and this slow melt up reminds me of a shorter version of what we saw in early 2017 (for those of you who were around and remember, you know what those relentless gains and strength month over month felt like). ETH hasn&#39;t even really started busting out on the ratio yet. After BTC finds a local top and starts to move sideways ETH is going to really start its move (this is warmup).</p>\n\n<p>Cheers friends.
