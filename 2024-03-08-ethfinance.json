This upward trend makes deflation slightly harder to maintain, but it won't be the main driver behind a return to inflation.\n\n**3)** ETH Price. Although `U` is denominated in GWEI which is ETH, users generally value gas fees in terms of fiat. If ETH's price suddenly doubles, the same fee you paid yesterday costs 2x of your fiat today. So the higher ETH's price is, the harder it is to satisfy the same `U`.\n\n**4)** Fiat Burned? I don't know if there's a better term for this. It's how much fiat users are willing to pay (burn) in fees. In other words, it's the fiat burned daily. Call it `F`.\n\n`F` is trending upward, which is good for deflation. It makes sense for high price volatility and fiat inflation to result in users being willing to pay more in fiat, but it's unpredictable. `F` doesn't have a formula. The market decides what it is, so the best we can do is observe averages.\n\nOver a 7d time frame, users have burned an average of [26,043,892 USD/day](https://ultrasound.money/#burn). `F` may continue increasing as this bull run takes off, but let's stick with 26M to finish illustrating the point. Using `F`, we can find the price at which ETH will start inflating again:\n\n`ETH = F / (U * 108B)` or `ETH = F / I`\n\nAs of this writing, that's 10,224.30USD/ETH. If, at that price, users are still only willing to burn 26M USD/day, deflation will end. Don't bother memorizing this price though. It's as volatile as `F` is, and by the time we get there, `I` and `U` might be higher too.
