Basically, these different councils have elections and the process isn&#39;t very standard as different people are running the programs each time. I think that detracts from how effective these elections can be. My thought is that a minimum there is a lot of community support for &quot;Shielded&quot; voting (results hidden until completion). So I&#39;m hoping at least that will get support, as I&#39;m breaking it our into three categories:</p>\n\n<p>- Mandating certain election types be used to avoid common pitfalls with less effective voting methods.</p>\n\n<p>- Mandating &quot;Shielded&quot; voting, as there are too many ways to game the election if results are public as they go along.</p>\n\n<p>- Mandating some type of minimum period for applicants to apply for roles to ensure we can get the best possible field possible.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-15 06:46:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kuznmae","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bf7318","parent_id":"t3_1bf7318","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SeaMonkey82","body":"> https://docs.arbit rum.foundation/foundation-documents#transparency-reports\n\nhttps://docs.arb.seamonkey.tech/foundation-documents#transparency-reports\n\n> https://forum.arbit rum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915  \n  \nhttps://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.arbit\">https://docs.arbit</a> rum.foundation/foundation-documents#transparency-reports</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.arb.seamonkey.tech/foundation-documents#transparency-reports\">https://docs.arb.seamonkey.tech/foundation-documents#transparency-reports</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbit\">https://forum.arbit</a> rum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915\">https://forum.arb.seamonkey.tech/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-15 11:25:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kv10lm3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bf7318","parent_id":"t1_kuznmae","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":":O\n\nI literally made the Chris Pratt surprise face IRL how do I perform this magic?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>:O</p>\n\n<p>I literally made the Chris Pratt surprise face IRL how do I perform this magic?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-15 11:29:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kv11bk3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bf7318","parent_id":"t1_kv10lm3","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SeaMonkey82","body":"https://serverfault.com/questions/344614/simple-apache2-redirect-from-one-domain-to-another\n\nThe way I've done it is probably the least efficient, dumbest way, but it works.
