In this meme market I suppose. 350 tokens at $5 each is $1750. Because it was only 90 days, annualized that would be $7k on my ~$20k (ETH is $4k in my heart). So 35% APR. Cool with me. Ill probably stay in if I think I will get 25% APR in season two. I will dump the gov tokens to realize my ETH yield.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-16 08:11:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kv5bhhl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bfzcrp","parent_id":"t3_1bfzcrp","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/2peg2city","body":"I had almost 2x your points and got less, so... no idea what is going on with this drop","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I had almost 2x your points and got less, so... no idea what is going on with this drop</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-16 08:35:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kv5fb77","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bfzcrp","parent_id":"t1_kv5bhhl","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/spinz808","body":"do we know total circulating supply at tge, is it only 5%? 5 bil FDV seems relatively low to me","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>do we know total circulating supply at tge, is it only 5%? 5 bil FDV seems relatively low to me</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-16 09:01:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kv5jdp1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bfzcrp","parent_id":"t1_kv5bhhl","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timwithnotoolbelt","body":"think i read the drop is 6%. indeed the market will not care that LIDO is worth less than 3 bil with over 10x the tvl.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>think i read the drop is 6%. indeed the market will not care that LIDO is worth less than 3 bil with over 10x the tvl.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-16 09:55:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kv5s3g3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bfzcrp","parent_id":"t1_kv5jdp1","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-16 08:48:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kv5hai2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bfzcrp","parent_id":"t1_kv5bhhl","score":0,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/UgotTrisomy21","body":"That\u2019s what it was trading for yesterday on pre market at kucoin\u00a0","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That\u2019s what it was trading for yesterday on pre market at kucoin\u00a0</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-16 08:51:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kv5hqz1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bfzcrp","parent_id":"t1_kv5hai2","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/timwithnotoolbelt","body":"Yes.Though not pretending to know that to be true.
