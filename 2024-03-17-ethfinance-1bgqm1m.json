I decided to check on Solscan, and then posted results on that post that's currently trending on /r/CryptoCurrency .\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BYJ586f\n\nWord on the grapevine is that this happened after [Jito ended their mempool last week](https://www.tekedia.com/tuna-chain-facilitates-native-yield-for-bitcoin-as-jito-labs-ends-mempool-functionality-on-solana/) to alleviate congestion on Solana, which then [led to more congestion](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bgjmla/solana_is_currently_congested_with_an_average/kv9fwnp/?context=3).\n\nPeople were seeing 50-90% failed transaction on many blocks like [this one](https://solscan.io/block/254611104) and [this one](https://solscan.io/block/254611329). Average Ping on the network was 30-60s, leading to transaction inclusion delays and a very slow network.\n\nThis also showed that **Solana maxes out at 1200 TPS**.\n\nFor the longest time, people kept on quoting theoretical 50k+ TPS. Vote transactions are still 80-90% of daily transactions, and they don't count. The highest throughput I've ever seen on Solana was just under 1200 True TPS during the Ordinals craze last year. Ordinals don't take up any compute power and barely take up any space, so they're extremely efficient transactions. Even when their mempool was complete full and congested yesterday, they were only seeing [900-1100 True TPS](https://imgur.com/aWQFslD).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Solana was failing badly yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>I had been hearing complaints about pending and failed transactions across multiple social platforms. Several had reported transactions stuck for hours. It was like a mini-outage. I decided to check on Solscan, and then posted results on that post that&#39;s currently trending on <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">/r/CryptoCurrency</a> .</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/BYJ586f\">https://imgur.com/BYJ586f</a></p>\n\n<p>Word on the grapevine is that this happened after <a href=\"https://www.tekedia.com/tuna-chain-facilitates-native-yield-for-bitcoin-as-jito-labs-ends-mempool-functionality-on-solana/\">Jito ended their mempool last week</a> to alleviate congestion on Solana, which then <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bgjmla/solana_is_currently_congested_with_an_average/kv9fwnp/?context=3\">led to more congestion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>People were seeing 50-90% failed transaction on many blocks like <a href=\"https://solscan.io/block/254611104\">this one</a> and <a href=\"https://solscan.io/block/254611329\">this one</a>. Average Ping on the network was 30-60s, leading to transaction inclusion delays and a very slow network.</p>\n\n<p>This also showed that <strong>Solana maxes out at 1200 TPS</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For the longest time, people kept on quoting theoretical 50k+ TPS. Vote transactions are still 80-90% of daily transactions, and they don&#39;t count. The highest throughput I&#39;ve ever seen on Solana was just under 1200 True TPS during the Ordinals craze last year. Ordinals don&#39;t take up any compute power and barely take up any space, so they&#39;re extremely efficient transactions. Even when their mempool was complete full and congested yesterday, they were only seeing <a href=\"https://imgur.com/aWQFslD\">900-1100 True TPS</a>.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-17 07:33:43","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kva95vm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bgqm1m","parent_id":"t3_1bgqm1m","score":46,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/15kisFUD","body":"I\u2019ve done some degen meme trading on Solana to scratch my degen itch and broaden my horizon.

What I\u2019m going to look for are signs in retail use, such as Coinbase app ranking, irl talk of crypto and crypto youtuber viewership. When it\u2019s not clear who the marginal buyer is, that\u2019s when I want to start selling. That\u2019s a tough one because there is always a narrative about other people that will buy our bags, even at the top. It may be China this time, or institutions or who knows what. Last time it was the incoming merge that stopped me from selling. This time I hope to be able to spot unrealistic narratives</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not betting all my money on timing the top because I\u2019ll likely get it wrong. That\u2019s why I also have laddered sells set on certain ETH price points. I\u2019ll probably reduce exposure to SOL around those same levels.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-17 23:03:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kve42im","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bgqm1m","parent_id":"t1_kve37ei","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Colombian_Meatsmoker","body":"I am thinking $8k would be a good point to get out.
