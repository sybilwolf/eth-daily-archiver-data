I used the Pendle YT strategy. Ahead of its launch today, Polyhedra\u2019s $ZK launch tomorrow, and Wormhole\u2019s $W launch, I\u2019m analysing best time to sell airdrops.\n\nThis is a reminder that whilst you may have PTSD about holding airdrops/alts in an eternal bleed to zero vs ETH but it doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t run in the short term and you don\u2019t have to jeet airdrops to ETH on day 1.\n\nAssuming you may not be available immediately at launch and/or you prefer to wait for low gas prices or less chaos to claim/sell on chain/send to CEX, it\u2019s best to look at historical daily close prices to analyse this. Also looking at price in ETH to allow for wider market USD performance.\n\nLooking at the last 7 big (IMO) airdrops daily close prices, none have peaked on day 1. Their peak prices post launch were as follows:\n\n* STRK: Day 16\n* DYM: Day 3\n* JUP: Day 46\n* ALT: Day 47\n* MANTA: Day 12\n* PYTH: Day 118\n* TIA: Day 101\n\nThe median here is day 46, you might choose to wait until closer to then to sell. Alternatively you could divide what you are looking to sell into 7 and sell 1/7th on day 3, 16 etc as above to hedge if fees make sense.\n\nI shared similar analysis prior to STRK, the median was a lot lower then - day 5. As several of the above tokens have ran up vs ETH since and set new highs as they\u2019ve had some more time post launch.\n\nIf you do plan to be hands on at launch then you could take a different approach. If you instead look at their daily high (not close) ETH price, then STRK, DYM, JUP and PYTH peaked day 1. That\u2019s roughly half of the 7 airdrops above. So you could aim to claim and insta dump half your allo and perhaps sell the remainder as per phasing above. Be prepared for gas fees to eat away your gains for ETHFI in particular though if claiming instantly.\n\nAlternatively, just ignore all this and insta-dump day 1 so you can delete from your CoinGecko watchlist and your mind. I get that.\n\nhttps://x.com/degenkolotoure/status/1769673019742408917?s=46","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I qualified for 6,064 $ETHFI in the ether.fi airdrop, $35k based on Kucoin pre market price of $5.5. I used the Pendle YT strategy. Ahead of its launch today, Polyhedra\u2019s $ZK launch tomorrow, and Wormhole\u2019s $W launch, I\u2019m analysing best time to sell airdrops.</p>\n\n<p>This is a reminder that whilst you may have PTSD about holding airdrops/alts in an eternal bleed to zero vs ETH but it doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t run in the short term and you don\u2019t have to jeet airdrops to ETH on day 1.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming you may not be available immediately at launch and/or you prefer to wait for low gas prices or less chaos to claim/sell on chain/send to CEX, it\u2019s best to look at historical daily close prices to analyse this. Also looking at price in ETH to allow for wider market USD performance.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the last 7 big (IMO) airdrops daily close prices, none have peaked on day 1. Their peak prices post launch were as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>STRK: Day 16</li>\n<li>DYM: Day 3</li>\n<li>JUP: Day 46</li>\n<li>ALT: Day 47</li>\n<li>MANTA: Day 12</li>\n<li>PYTH: Day 118</li>\n<li>TIA: Day 101</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The median here is day 46, you might choose to wait until closer to then to sell. Alternatively you could divide what you are looking to sell into 7 and sell 1/7th on day 3, 16 etc as above to hedge if fees make sense.</p>\n\n<p>I shared similar analysis prior to STRK, the median was a lot lower then - day 5. As several of the above tokens have ran up vs ETH since and set new highs as they\u2019ve had some more time post launch.</p>\n\n<p>If you do plan to be hands on at launch then you could take a different approach. If you instead look at their daily high (not close) ETH price, then STRK, DYM, JUP and PYTH peaked day 1. That\u2019s roughly half of the 7 airdrops above. So you could aim to claim and insta dump half your allo and perhaps sell the remainder as per phasing above. Be prepared for gas fees to eat away your gains for ETHFI in particular though if claiming instantly.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, just ignore all this and insta-dump day 1 so you can delete from your CoinGecko watchlist and your mind. I get that.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/degenkolotoure/status/1769673019742408917?s=46\">https://x.com/degenkolotoure/status/1769673019742408917?s=46</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-18 03:37:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kvepoa5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bhjqu7","parent_id":"t3_1bhjqu7","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"I instadump as a public good.

Ask someone about Solana they will say \"it's faster than Ethereum\".\u00a0In addition, \"ETH maxis\" aren't like other \"maxis\".

The average SOL or BTC investor probably isn't making the same \"rational\" decisions.\u00a0I also think the market cap of ETH is more \"real\" in that they're aren't any central entities that are hoarding large amounts of the supply. Both BTC and SOL have lockups(Satoshi, VCs...) that make there market caps less \"real\". ETH is also functioning more so as a proper financial asset and currency than the number go up games, which could hurt price in the short term, but I would argue gives MAJOR upside potential in the long term,\u00a0not to mention the fact it gives more downside protection.\n\n\nETH will hopefully get significant help in price when an ETF is approved.

If you submit a transaction and it gets executed on the validator you might be unlucky and another transaction on a parallel lane might have reserved access to the same resources. If this is the case, your transaction has to go back to the queue and wait for another chance to get on an execution lane. In normal parallel programming your transaction would just have to wait in their execution lane until the resource is free again. But because solana has to go fast they decided, NO, if your transaction wants access to the same resources, it has to go back into the waiting queue. To the best of my knowledge, there is no deterministic way to know when your transaction has its turn again. It does not get any priority because it was there earlier. So it could be that another transaction gets on the chain earlier just because you were unlucky and you sent your transaction at the same time as another one using the same resource. This at its core is a ~~and~~ nondeterministic behaviour which makes people submit the same transaction many times to increase the chance for the transaction to get included earlier. Sure all the other submitted ones will fail, but at least one of the submitted transaction made it in. All these failing transactions still clog the chain and will probably delay your transaction even more, until your transaction is not valid anymore due to slippage limits or other reasons.\n\nAnother issue is their local fee market. Apparently it has a lot of non-deterministic elements in it as well. So it could be that you get your transaction in even though you did not pay a high enough fee. Again, this encourages people to submit tons of transactions in the hope that one might make it in at a lower fee. At the same time, due to the non-deterministic and just in time fee local fee market, most people do not know how much they have to pay for a transaction to maybe get included, so most of them overpay.\n\nBoth of these mechanisms have been designed horribly, which is ok if the chain is not at capacity but as soon as it reaches capacity it encourages people to submit a lot more transactions, destabilizing the chain even more. Which ends up in a lot of failed transactions for everyone. Funnily both of these badly designed mechanisms (parallelization, local fee markets) have been touted as the holy grail for their superior system but they fail as soon as they are actually used. \n\nThere is a recent bell curve podcast discussing local fee markets, parallelization and the issues they have due to their design. They also briefly touch on failed transactions and some of their origins. It is definitely worth a listen at least for the first 30-40 minutes: https://blockworks.co/podcast/bellcurve/92145946-b438-11ee-a175-438e76b77591","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Your Solana transactions most probably fail because Solana is designed in an extremely horrible way and there is no simple solution to fix this for them. </p>\n\n<p>The first problem is their parallelization approach.
