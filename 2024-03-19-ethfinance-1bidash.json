My own size is not size, and those L1 txs risk taking a good bite out of the profit. We&#39;ll see. Right now my annualized returns, assuming an exit in 16 days, come out to 78% APY.

It will cause state to grow faster so the size of the DB execution nodes store will increase more quickly, but if the rate from 30 was OK years ago then 40 is easily OK now. Another issue is larger blocks means more data to propagate around the planet over ethereum p2p network, but again over recent years fibre connections have become normal and faster so increase is safe.

They are complaining when it&#39;s mass euphoria onchain, and a simple gas limit increase of 25% won&#39;t make a dent on fees during these periods.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-19 14:18:58","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-03-19 14:22:06","id":"kvn0gpc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bidash","parent_id":"t1_kvmirnx","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Mountainminer","body":"Oh nooooooooo!!!!!!!
