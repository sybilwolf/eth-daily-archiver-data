You know your situation best to know what course of action you should take. \n\nAbout RPL being a security in the US, I don't think it's something we really have to worry about at this time. The RPL ICO happened in 2017 and it is outside the statute of limitations for the SEC to challenge that.

The Houston upgrade is happening on May 6th. That will make RP even more decentralised than it is now. It's pretty cool. One of the most exciting changes will be allowing whale marriages to happen at the protocol level. That means, 2 parties will be able to bring eth and rpl separately and stake it together.

I am definitely curious to see that and yesterdays release of a blackrock tokenized fund on Ethereum definitely goes in that direction.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-20 02:46:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kvpka9k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bj6k75","parent_id":"t1_kvphr4p","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Surprise surprise.
