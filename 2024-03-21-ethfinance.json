As a genesis solo validator, I would like to share with you the reasons why I oppose the increase in block size at the present time.\n\n1. It is pointless. We are not going to attract new users or new use cases by simply reducing fees for a very limited time. No one is going to consider using Ethereum because a transaction costs $4 instead of $5. I understand it is annoying to hear the same complaints over high fees over and over again, but those complaints are not going to be tamed with a fee reduction that would anyway last very little. As an example, the last hard fork has indeed reduced fees on L1 more or less on the same scale that a block increase would do, but almost no one noticed.\n2. It is not sufficiently tested and could be dangerous, especially for small validators. When reasons for increasing size are cited, reference is usually made to disk size, but other more important factors for small operations are bandwidth, data-rate limits, computational capacity or ram installed. Increasing the block size increases resources and could expose small validators to spam attacks that cause them to lose their turn and thus allow an attacker to steal rewards or MEV from them.\n3. It could hurt L2 scaling plans. The last hard fork allowed Ethereum L2s to start competing with more centralized alternative L1s. However, even with 3 blobs per block the tps we are seeing are very low with respect to for example Solana, whose transactions per second are close to 1000. An increase in the number of blobs can be very significant to achieve equivalent capacity. This improvement, in contrast to a limited increase in block size, can indeed attract new users, developers and use cases, since the chosen L2 could offer the same tps as L1 alternatives, but with the added security provided by the Ethereum network, as well as compatibility with existing tools and ease of development. In short: the space we would lose by increasing the block size in a rush might be needed in the future to increase blob capacity.\n\nTherefore, I think this is not the right time to increase the block size. I think we should wait until Ethereum L2s have reached a point where they can compete with alternative L1s in terms of capacity and the cases where complex blocks can cause small validators to miss blocks have been thoroughly tested and eliminated.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys.

If you submit a transaction and it gets executed on the validator you might be unlucky and another transaction on a parallel lane might have reserved access to the same resources. If this is the case, your transaction has to go back to the queue and wait for another chance to get on an execution lane. In normal parallel programming your transaction would just have to wait in their execution lane until the resource is free again. But because solana has to go fast they decided, NO, if your transaction wants access to the same resources, it has to go back into the waiting queue. To the best of my knowledge, there is no deterministic way to know when your transaction has its turn again. It does not get any priority because it was there earlier. So it could be that another transaction gets on the chain earlier just because you were unlucky and you sent your transaction at the same time as another one using the same resource. This at its core is a\u00a0and\u00a0nondeterministic behaviour which makes people submit the same transaction many times to increase the chance for the transaction to get included earlier. Sure all the other submitted ones will fail, but at least one of the submitted transaction made it in. All these failing transactions still clog the chain and will probably delay your transaction even more, until your transaction is not valid anymore due to slippage limits or other reasons.\n\n>Another issue is their local fee market. Apparently it has a lot of non-deterministic elements in it as well. So it could be that you get your transaction in even though you did not pay a high enough fee. Again, this encourages people to submit tons of transactions in the hope that one might make it in at a lower fee. At the same time, due to the non-deterministic and just in time fee local fee market, most people do not know how much they have to pay for a transaction to maybe get included, so most of them overpay.\n\n>Both of these mechanisms have been designed horribly, which is ok if the chain is not at capacity but as soon as it reaches capacity it encourages people to submit a lot more transactions, destabilizing the chain even more.
