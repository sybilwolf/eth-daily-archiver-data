To chalk this up to a crypto problem feels kind of ridiculous to me. While Liberosist mentioned ICO mania in the post and said it has become worse since, I'm not convinced. Time tends to wash away the grimy details of the there and then. ICO mania was degenerate and shameless as hell. Crypto YouTubers pumping and dumping like there's no tomorrow. To me it just feels like much of a muchness the whole 7 years I've been in this space, but I guess that's subjective. I get the impression that things were the same in the early days of the internet when there was both cat memes and shock sites almost from day 1. Same as it ever was.\n\nI also get the impression from u/Liberosist from their Bankless interview that they move from hobby to hobby/niche interest quite a bit. I do the same but EthFinance is what keeps me here the most. I no longer partake in other crypto media channels like YouTube and other subreddits where I used to consume quite a lot of content. I do wonder if they never wandered into the toxic X/Shitter cesspool they may not have been bombarded with all the crap this space has to be flung.\n\nBut to be fair, what good is this whataboutism and finger pointing I'm doing? That doesn't nullify Polynya's criticisms other than identifying that their standards for a global community of humans are probably a bit unrealistic/naive in my opinion. Well maybe I would have a better time convincing them of crypto's goodness if I simply pointed here instead. This community and core Ethereum aligned builders and supporters are to this day the most genuine, friendly collection of people I have ever met online. Nobody in this subreddit should mean anything to me. No other online community provides this same feeling. Not even online friends who I have gamed with for years on end. Yet meeting up for Hodlercon in 2022 I felt right at home like catching up with long lost family.\n\nI'm a bit of a luddite. I don't like most new technology because a lot of it has gone from empowering the individual like it did in the past to reducing the self-reliance of the individual which increases the leverage which companies and governments have over our self-sovereignty. But this space is the last beacon of hope for me that technology can still improve out lives. ***So with that established, I vehemently reject the notion that crypto's moral compass is broken.*** Instead, I propose that new technologies are providing opportunities to the opportunistic as it has always done. Criminals are almost always the first to follow a new wave of technology because there is so much at stake for them. They are closely followed by entrepreneurs and grifters because there is so much to gain for them. These groups always attract more attention than the heads down, hard working true believers. But don't under-estimate that last group.\n\nWe have come so fucking far. We're scaling in a decentralised manner - the 5\u00a2 internet of money meme from 2014 Vitalik is now a reality. Just think how much this actually achieves for the unbanked majority of the world! We're rising up to challenges like never before. We have (likely) just crushed *both* execution layer and consensus layer client diversity threats and will continue to fight this fight. Finally, we're also raising money for the open source community like never before. The open source community has been critically under-funded for decades. Gitcoin grants is not perfect but fuck has it raised some money for projects which otherwise would've never gotten off the ground. Furthermore, hundreds of thousands have been raised for legal fights for crypto. Remember Pooly? We raised funds and stood the fuck up to obviously farcical legal bullying coming from the incumbents. What about the hundreds of thousands raised for the TornadoCash devs? I bet if it was Graphene OS or Tails OS private operating systems under the gavel, barely any money would be raised at all for those devs. Nobody would care aside from maybe an organisation like the EFF and those that do care would lack the means, drive or funding to speak up and help them fight the good fight in court.\n\nI'm sorry but we're fucking killing it out here and I think it's a real shame to give up because of a few grifters, shit throwers and very likely paid for bots who can shout louder than the rest of us on objectively trash media platforms. These web 2 platforms thrive and profit off of controversy. What do you expect? Did those fighting in the crypto wars 1.0 give up when the US government wanted to ban cryptography? Absolutely not!

Ethereum does 15 tps, of a very crude down-to-the-machine nature, you cannot onboard the world to anything with that. It's only now with the scalability improvements induced by EIP-4844 that we can start doing so. Good UX has a very significant overhead in terms of compute. This has been the story of software development, our computers have gotten immensely faster but programs don't go much faster, instead all that extra performance has gone into better/fancier UX. The same is going to happen with crypto. First you build the infrastructure, then you can build the products.\n\nIt's no surprise that in the initial stages, while you are not ready to onboard the masses, it's only fringe use cases that dominate. You cannot start with a safety critical use case, or one that is lathered in layers and layers of regulation, or is targeted for mass consumption as this requires excellent UX. It's the fringe, bordering illegal that first surges. Because those cases are heavily constrained otherwise, so they can at least exist in a permissionless system.

It has just unlocked a 30x scalability improvement and set the first bricks to target mass adoption.\n- Ethereum's L0 is solving very complex coordination problems, frequently coordinating and coalescing on a path to improve the protocol layer, decentralizing the client distribution, etc... These problems are incredibly difficult to tackle, they typically fall for the tragedy of the commons. Heck, we are seeing it at play with climate change which has potentially catastrophic consequences for our species and we seem unable to do enough about it.
