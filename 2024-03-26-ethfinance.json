I ordered them in terms of what I'd personally like to know the most, but if something resonates with you more feel free to ignore the others. And they would be US focused questions since it's regulatory stuff, although don't mind if they are geared towards broader markers and investors. \n\n1) What is Ram seeing in his circles for the reason that ETH is *still* being the definitive second option against BTC instead of a '1a and 1b' situation. To keep it focused for time (although if he wants to expand go for it!), I will point the question very specifically in the context of BTC getting an ETF before ETH. Is it really the broad market sentiment that BTC is a definitive step above ETH? Or is this more just a byproduct of the SEC / US Government deciding to space out ETF approvals? For context: The way I see it, there is no real reason BTC should have gotten such a massive head-start in the ETF space given ETH has now been an established network on par with BTC's popularity for nearly 10 years now.  \n\n2) When does Ram see the US government getting to a point where a comprehensive regulatory framework for blockchain technology is established? I'll emphasis this as a 'positively' focused question, as I am one who believes there is a need for some basic, common-sense guiderails for the space to truly take off.

I ordered them in terms of what I&#39;d personally like to know the most, but if something resonates with you more feel free to ignore the others. And they would be US focused questions since it&#39;s regulatory stuff, although don&#39;t mind if they are geared towards broader markers and investors. </p>\n\n<p>1) What is Ram seeing in his circles for the reason that ETH is <em>still</em> being the definitive second option against BTC instead of a &#39;1a and 1b&#39; situation. To keep it focused for time (although if he wants to expand go for it!), I will point the question very specifically in the context of BTC getting an ETF before ETH. Is it really the broad market sentiment that BTC is a definitive step above ETH? Or is this more just a byproduct of the SEC / US Government deciding to space out ETF approvals? For context: The way I see it, there is no real reason BTC should have gotten such a massive head-start in the ETF space given ETH has now been an established network on par with BTC&#39;s popularity for nearly 10 years now.  </p>\n\n<p>2) When does Ram see the US government getting to a point where a comprehensive regulatory framework for blockchain technology is established? I&#39;ll emphasis this as a &#39;positively&#39; focused question, as I am one who believes there is a need for some basic, common-sense guiderails for the space to truly take off.

Here is my experience:\n\nTLDR: I love it.\n\nThe gnosis pay card is a visa debit card linked to a (gnosis) safe wallet on the gnosis chain. To the best of my knowledge it is the only non-custodial debit card in the market. Gnosis pay directly deducts EURe from my safe wallet every time I use it. I can set a daily limit, which I guess works similar to a daily ERC-20 approval for them to deduct EURe up to the limit set. I tried to find/understand the smart contract code which handles this part, but it was is a bit over my head for the 10 minutes I spent on it. Generally, I am in control of my funds and can withdraw them at any time with a delay of 3 minutes. Transactions do not cost me anything. I get the exact amount of EURO deducted that I get quoted in the payment terminal. \n\nI use the card to pay for my groceries and coffee. Recently, they also enabled online shopping, which I used to buy a game on steam and public transport tickets on my phone. The card generally works great. I had issues with changing my PIN code which failed, but still registered as successful, so I had 2 different PINs depending on the use case. It took the support a few days to figure out and fix it. That is the price you pay for being early. Contactless payment works very well. I sometimes have to insert the card in the payment terminal, were I am asked if I want to pay in EUR or my local currency. This definitely is an inconvenience, which is probably due to the the payment terminal provider that wants me to use their higher exchange rates. I guess if you mainly use it in a EURO country this won't be an issue at all. To monitor the wallet, I use the zerion mobile app to watch my gnosis pay wallet and get notified within seconds every time I use the card.\n\nThere are also a few things which make the card a bit of a hassle for some people:\n\nThe gnosis pay safe wallet itself cannot be used directly to swap ERC-20 tokens into EURe. AFAIK the reason is that ERC-20 approvals are not allowed in that special gnosis pay wallet and they might disable your card. One has to swap tokens to EURe using a different wallet and then forward the funds to the gnosis pay wallet. I do not have this issue. I use my gnosis chain validator rewards which are automatically exchanged to EURe and forwarded to my gnosis pay wallet on a weekly basis.\n\nEverything is happening on gnosis chain. Gnosis chain is not supported by any major CEX. Getting funds on there adds friction. Most people go through an Ethereum L2 to bridge ETH to Gnosis chain and then swap the ETH to EURe. Cowswap is deployed in gnosis chain and works perfectly for this. You also need a small amount of xDAI on gnosis chain as xDAI is used to pay for gas. There is a faucet which gets drained regularly. If you need some the mods in the gnosis chain discord can send you a tiny amount of xDAI.\n\nMonerium supports gnosis to directly send EURe from your bank account to gnosis chain. Unfortunately, monerium seems to be very picky about new customers. As far as I understand a native integration of an IBAN number with your gnosis pay wallet should come soon (~months?) which should make it very easy to transfer funds from your bank account to your gnosis pay wallet. You can then also forward these EURe to other wallets and exchange them for ETH. That would be a pretty good onboarding experience.\n\nGnosis pay card can only be ordered from European countries and as far as I understand if you are from the UK you use GBPe as your card currency which has only recently gotten some liquidity, so make sure the slippage is not too big going from ETH->GBPe.\n\nAll in all I think it is great to have a crypto native debit card in my pocket and it is my main card I use at the moment.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have been using my gnosis pay debit card for a bit more than a month.

Most of you guys rely on supermajority.info, but obviously there are some unknowns since not all proposer sets have publicly stated their client usage (Binance, Kraken, OKX, Bitcoin Suisse, etc.).\n\nThe idea is that even though most blocks are built through PBS, every proposer still has a small share of locally built blocks (min-bid reversions, network latency delaying payloads from relays, local blocks being more valuable than PBS if there isn't much MEV during the block, etc.) and for those subsets of blocks we can look at the extra\\_data encoded on-chain to tag what clients proposers are using.\n\nPart of the issue with this methodology is that besu and erigon don't actually embed extra\\_data so the field is blank, and at the same time there are some MEV builders who try to stay anonymous and don't embed data, so we can only cleanly tag geth and Nethermind, and then we need to check vs off-chain MEV data to see if the empty data blocks are from anonymous MEV builders or from one of besu/erigon.\n\nOn top of that, there's occasionally been MEV builders using the Nethermind tag that briefly crop up. I think this is just from misconfigurations because they go away pretty quick, but it adds a bit of noise to the data.

OKX is a pretty reliable proposer, so they don't have many local blocks.\n* Bitcoin Suisse is 100% geth.\n\nThe data is here for anyone that wants a peak:\n\n[https://hackmd.io/@dataalways/execution-layer-diversity](https://hackmd.io/@dataalways/execution-layer-diversity)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s not a topic I look at much, or one that I plan to spend much more time on, but I spent my morning trying to fill in some knowledge gaps about execution layer clients this morning. Most of you guys rely on supermajority.info, but obviously there are some unknowns since not all proposer sets have publicly stated their client usage (Binance, Kraken, OKX, Bitcoin Suisse, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>The idea is that even though most blocks are built through PBS, every proposer still has a small share of locally built blocks (min-bid reversions, network latency delaying payloads from relays, local blocks being more valuable than PBS if there isn&#39;t much MEV during the block, etc.) and for those subsets of blocks we can look at the extra_data encoded on-chain to tag what clients proposers are using.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the issue with this methodology is that besu and erigon don&#39;t actually embed extra_data so the field is blank, and at the same time there are some MEV builders who try to stay anonymous and don&#39;t embed data, so we can only cleanly tag geth and Nethermind, and then we need to check vs off-chain MEV data to see if the empty data blocks are from anonymous MEV builders or from one of besu/erigon.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, there&#39;s occasionally been MEV builders using the Nethermind tag that briefly crop up. I think this is just from misconfigurations because they go away pretty quick, but it adds a bit of noise to the data.

I remember the PlayStation project as well, and couldn\u2019t understand why bitcoin wouldn\u2019t do something similar. </p>\n\n<p>My brain is super fried right now, but I feel like the idea of letting a node work on such problems and being rewarded by some form of share from the ones giving out the task, shares many similarities to the idea of retaking. Although it\u2019s not exactly substituting the underlying work of securing the network (and rather piles more work on top of that to the more beefy nodes). At least it utilises already existing infrastructure to solve more problems, though with a somewhat sketchy potential for self harm/conflicting incentives.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-26 17:29:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kwq8e23","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bo0lmo","parent_id":"t1_kwpwpu9","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Give it some thought when you're less fried and talk to me about the potential for conflicting incentives you see!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Give it some thought when you&#39;re less fried and talk to me about the potential for conflicting incentives you see!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-26 22:33:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kwrcv4e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bo0lmo","parent_id":"t1_kwq8e23","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/BigglyBillBrasky","body":"\"Baaaabe, the Logris DePin post is up!\"","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>&quot;Baaaabe, the Logris DePin post is up!&quot;</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-26 17:43:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kwqame8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bo0lmo","parent_id":"t1_kwpwpu9","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/DayTraderBiH","body":"With the nice price rise of ETHFI I am thinking about selling my airdrop but keeping my eETH to earn points/EL Points/and staking rewards in the protocol.

I'm not American myself nor even anglo but spend most of my life in English-speaking places, and this makes for an easier time spotting the biases of both Americans, and non-American Anglos, and my own culture. Sometimes these biases overlap. Sometimes they don't. Some other cultures are much more alien to either of our cultures.\n\n\nClass bias is also real, and something we hardly ever address overtly in crypto is the way just about every person who rants about blockchain culture is wealthy, while many people who partake in those problematic onchain activities are rather obviously less privileged.\n\n\nThere's no such things as universal human values, so when you think about it for a moment, it would make sense for MOST of the stuff you see in a *truly* permissionless and decentralized space, a space of liberty and egality, to sound remote, weird, bizarre, and possibly repulsive to you.\n\n\nIt's hard to balance these words with the real human suffering caused by scams. There are problems there. Yet, I'm inclined to think the answer lies elsewhere than in noncommital blames of the entire space.\n\n\nConsider the following: if *most* of crypto culture is bad, then wouldn't that make most participants willful participants? Either the culture is acceptable to them, or they are driven to it by desperation with the other environments they have access to. In that second scenario, does that not imply 1) the root cause of the issue comes down to these other environments, with bad crypto culture a downstream effect, and 2) bad crypto culture is a consequence of a few bad actors who profit from the situation?\n\n\nAnd if we decide it is an exploiter and exploited situation, does it make sense to blame the many victims? Or would it be more sensible to name and shame the criminals?\n\n\nIt's easy to criticize everyone at once because it comes with no reputational damage. The writer may even end up praised by their targets, in a mutual virtue signaling win!\u00a0\n\n\nIt's much harder to take on the effort and risk of pointing out each rotten apple. Particularly if we graduate beyond common scammers and attack incestuous and entrenched power circles. Everyone loves to dunk on Richard Heart (and rightfully so, mind you), fewer are the voices denouncing Sam Altman.\n\n\nI like blockchain and I like that most of the stuff I see on blockchain is not stuff I like and stuff I dislike.

Some other cultures are much more alien to either of our cultures.</p>\n\n<p>Class bias is also real, and something we hardly ever address overtly in crypto is the way just about every person who rants about blockchain culture is wealthy, while many people who partake in those problematic onchain activities are rather obviously less privileged.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no such things as universal human values, so when you think about it for a moment, it would make sense for MOST of the stuff you see in a <em>truly</em> permissionless and decentralized space, a space of liberty and egality, to sound remote, weird, bizarre, and possibly repulsive to you.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s hard to balance these words with the real human suffering caused by scams. There are problems there. Yet, I&#39;m inclined to think the answer lies elsewhere than in noncommital blames of the entire space.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following: if <em>most</em> of crypto culture is bad, then wouldn&#39;t that make most participants willful participants? Either the culture is acceptable to them, or they are driven to it by desperation with the other environments they have access to. In that second scenario, does that not imply 1) the root cause of the issue comes down to these other environments, with bad crypto culture a downstream effect, and 2) bad crypto culture is a consequence of a few bad actors who profit from the situation?</p>\n\n<p>And if we decide it is an exploiter and exploited situation, does it make sense to blame the many victims? Or would it be more sensible to name and shame the criminals?</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s easy to criticize everyone at once because it comes with no reputational damage. The writer may even end up praised by their targets, in a mutual virtue signaling win!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s much harder to take on the effort and risk of pointing out each rotten apple. Particularly if we graduate beyond common scammers and attack incestuous and entrenched power circles. Everyone loves to dunk on Richard Heart (and rightfully so, mind you), fewer are the voices denouncing Sam Altman.</p>\n\n<p>I like blockchain and I like that most of the stuff I see on blockchain is not stuff I like and stuff I dislike. Let me use what I like, let me call out precise instances of exploitative behavior, and above all let me let others be.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-26 14:31:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kwpeele","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bo0lmo","parent_id":"t3_1bo0lmo","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Very wise.
