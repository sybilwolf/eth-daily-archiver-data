I actually used co-pilot to help me .  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Essentially what I learned was Prometheum is more stringently aligned with the SEC at the US federal level (as opposed to Coinbase who is less SEC compliant and at a state level ).   So  if  Prometheum can custody ETH, this indirectly/backdoor points to ETH being a security since aligned with SEC regs.  ETH being a security (instead of a commodity) brings more laws/uncertainty which would leave  ETH being a riskier investment compared to being defined as a commodity. However, US lawmakers are questioning Prometheum  with ETH because SEC never said ETH was a security. Prometheum was given the green light to custody by FINRA (not SEC) .  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the details .................\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Difference between custody by Prometheum and Coinbase** \n\n**From co-pilot:**\n\n*The key difference lies in Prometheum\u2019s direct compliance with SEC regulations, which could potentially allow it to handle a broader range of digital asset securities, whereas Coinbase operates under a mix of state and federal regulations but has not sought the same level of SEC compliance for its entire platform as Prometheum has.

I actually used co-pilot to help me .  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Essentially what I learned was Prometheum is more stringently aligned with the SEC at the US federal level (as opposed to Coinbase who is less SEC compliant and at a state level ).   So  if  Prometheum can custody ETH, this indirectly/backdoor points to ETH being a security since aligned with SEC regs.  ETH being a security (instead of a commodity) brings more laws/uncertainty which would leave  ETH being a riskier investment compared to being defined as a commodity.

Incredibly interesting (and $profitable) idea! They offer an elegant solution to some of the RPL validator woes some of us have experienced and added an immense\u00a0opportunity to expand RPL! Yesterday they released a document critiquing some of the proposed updates to Rocketpool. If you're a RP node operator, as I am, it is definitely worth reading the abstract below at least. Healthy discussion and constructive criticism is how we avoid centralization cliffs and\u00a0 protocol instability. Would love to have u/waqwaqattack weigh in on this \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n>The current tokenomics proposal that has received the most attention fundamentally changes the relationship between RPL and the protocol and, therefore, the relationships between stakeholders in the system. Our findings indicate that the proposed new dynamics may be less healthy than existing dynamics because they create a financialized shareholder class that is economically incentivized to exploit the other actors (NOs, rETH holders) who make the system run, necessarily changing the makeup of these groups over time. In turn, this is likely to eventually lead to systemic instability and a transformation of RP into a protocol dominated by ungovernable large actors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n>While RPL exists today as a utility token with an indirect revenue model fundamentally tied to node operation, the new proposals shift it towards an asset that can be priced more concretely by the market through ETH revenue accrual, opening it to increased levels of speculator ownership rather than participant ownership. Although this may make RPL more attractive to some, it does so by taking value from existing and future NOs, and for many scenarios, there is little change in terminal valuation versus existing tokenomics.

Incredibly interesting (and $profitable) idea! They offer an elegant solution to some of the RPL validator woes some of us have experienced and added an immense\u00a0opportunity to expand RPL! Yesterday they released a document critiquing some of the proposed updates to Rocketpool. If you&#39;re a RP node operator, as I am, it is definitely worth reading the abstract below at least. Healthy discussion and constructive criticism is how we avoid centralization cliffs and\u00a0 protocol instability. Would love to have <a href=\"/u/waqwaqattack\">u/waqwaqattack</a> weigh in on this \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The current tokenomics proposal that has received the most attention fundamentally changes the relationship between RPL and the protocol and, therefore, the relationships between stakeholders in the system. Our findings indicate that the proposed new dynamics may be less healthy than existing dynamics because they create a financialized shareholder class that is economically incentivized to exploit the other actors (NOs, rETH holders) who make the system run, necessarily changing the makeup of these groups over time. In turn, this is likely to eventually lead to systemic instability and a transformation of RP into a protocol dominated by ungovernable large actors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>While RPL exists today as a utility token with an indirect revenue model fundamentally tied to node operation, the new proposals shift it towards an asset that can be priced more concretely by the market through ETH revenue accrual, opening it to increased levels of speculator ownership rather than participant ownership.
