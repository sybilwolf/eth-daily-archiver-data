Currently with MEV-Boost, the Ethereum protocol doesn't have any knowledge of the process.

[mev burn](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-burn-a-simple-design/15590) would make the protocol aware of MEV value by making builders bid each other up on a \"payload base fee\" that gets burned, with auction structure designed in such a way that ~most of the value would end up burned rather than kept by the builder or proposer. [Execution Tickets](https://ethresear.ch/t/execution-tickets/17944) (which I like) would make the protocol aware of MEV by selling off \"tickets\" (in exchange for ETH, which is burned), where block production rights are decided by random selection (and burn) of a ticket.

You can look specifically at the different duties a validator performs today (attestations, blocks, sync committee, maybe ILs?) and say \"oh, they're already providing multiple services, that's a form of restaking\" (see [rainbow staking](https://ethresear.ch/t/unbundling-staking-towards-rainbow-staking/18683)). With sufficient visibility into the operation of each of these services, the protocol could be designed to smooth/burn each one, as is currently being discussed for block production + MEV.\n\nRestaking through EigenLayer is kind of like block production with MEV-Boost today. The Ethereum protocol doesn't have any visibility into the operational details and do can't effectively burn or smooth its rewards.

This is mostly for myself but might be helpful to others. One of those posts where people tell you in the bear market to do things and prepare for the bull and write things down. Well, I've done it, I've written it down. Not just applicable for the next bull market but for a bit longer.\n\nYou can find way better styled version on paragraph but here's the basic one:\n\n-----\n\n**So you wanna make it? A message to my future self!**\n\nA message to my future, and even present, self on how to make it and not just in crypto but in life!\n\n----\n\nHello, my future friend.\n\nNow, take a moment and come back to the present moment.\n\nSo you wanna make it? \n\nMaybe sometimes you feel scared that you are ngmi: you lost the edge or the market is no longer irrational and smarter than you are. It's okay. Relax, take a breath, go for a walk. \n\nFundamentals of assets like Ethereum might still be insanely strong but how is the foundation of your portfolio?\n\nConfused a bit? good, now let's dive in.\n\nFirst and foremost, you are going to miss out on gen wealth opportunities. \n\nThe worst part? \n\nNot just on one, on dozens. \n\nThe best part?\n\nYou are gonna make it either way. \n\nFollowing this, you are gonna make it not just in crypto and financially, but most importantly in life.\n\nSome others are going to make more. Yes, I know FOMO is a bitch. Oh and yes, it makes you feel like you are not as sharp anymore or that you should be able to hit those insane plays like any other guys in the group that you are trading with. But remember, people rarely post their losses. Even you don't post all your losses one by one. \n\nKnow your numbers and stick to your journey. You have your life. You wanna make it in your way and life, not in others. Making it is making it. Getting complacent might not be an issue and yet it's important to remember there's no need to rush the process. Yes, there might be still some clock when you need to hit certain amounts but make sure those are dictated by your true Self and not traumas and, definitely, not by society or anyone else. \n\nKnow your strengths. Long-term game might not be sexy and shiny yet there's a reason you have edge there and will win that way. \n\nBefriend great genuine people in the space if you haven't yet. Those friendships could last a lifetime. When you made those friends, check up on them from time to time. Sometimes you guys might not talk for months yet the bond is still there and there's so much shared experience and understanding, especially if you are in the shared communities.\n\nYou are not entitled to anything. When you eventually end up feeling that way. Take a break, go for a walk and zoom out. The standard procedure by now. Slowing down and recentering oneself is key. \n\nBe open minded, it makes you more balanced given the default internal compass for the right things yet that can get too extreme so far and will cost you a lot: money in this space but also mental health and relationships.\n\nEverything wants your attention. Everything fights for it. Be intentional. Mornings are for you. Slow down throughout the day too to focus on what's important FOR YOU. Splitting attention has a cost and you have already experienced. Yes, that does mean that you are going to miss some opportunities or not make 'as much' but that's an illusion in itself. Juggling too many balls is unsustainable. \n\nNow onto more concrete trading points.\n\nBuying into volume and sellin. Buying in when things go euphoric already and you feel like you're late is still better than buying into fundamentals with no volume. You can always set a tight SL or babysit for a bit and take 10-20% L if needed. \n\nAttention. Narrative. Volume. Price. Cycle. This is what makes memecoins great and gives projects virality and that's what most non-degen projects miss. You can have the best project but if noone knows about it then what's the value of that? You can have a shitcoin without any intrinsic value but if there's a social layer build around that then that's the value assigned by our society. You still think the social layer has no power? Next time there's a time change, don't change yours and see how events play out.\n\nGreat Risk/Reward aka R/R. One of the most basic yet key concepts. EV aka estimated value falls in the same field too. You do not need to be 100% right. In fact, you need to be only right 50%+% of the fees and anything on top would be your profit. This game might not be fancy yet it is profitable and consistent if you have the edge. If you don't have the edge, what are you even doing here?! \n\nMoney Management - the other most basic and key skill. You can be right 99% of the time yet if you have poor money managment skills - you are ngmi. Both money management and finding the edge, therefore increasing your edge and value that you are getting can be worked on and improved, thus making them skills that you can get better with practice. Deliberate practice makes the growth parabolic. Don't know where to start learning those skills? Study Kelly Criterion. Know about that? Still review it from time to time and remind yourself how things work on a meta level. \n\nEmotions. Lots of people say you need to be logical and trade without emotions. Emotions exist whether you want them to exist or not. As a human being you are going to feel emotions. They are neither bad nor good. They just are. When it comes to trading, emotions are another source of information. If you have not realized it yet, information is power. The key distinction to make is to take emotions into account yet not trade from the emotions. You are in control of making the decisions and not emotions. Who are 'You' in this case? Well, that's a life long journey for you to start exploring but I'll give you a hint: You/true Self/Self/whatever other name you wanna use has been alive from the beginning and you can tap into it. Yes, sounds easier said than done, that's the life long practice. \n\nLook for sharp people. Usually, those people do what we've talked about before. They probably don't have much following yet seem to be killing it.\n\nOkay we got till here, you are making profits now and you are stable in general, maybe not insane wins but remember you are on your path. \n\nWell now you are making a profit but you know what still sucks? \n\nYou are not selling the top. Don't worry about it, the only way you are going to make it is by consistently selling in the profit accord to your r/r. Yes, selling the top would've been a feel good moment but you won't be able to do it consistently. Sell and be complete either by moving on or setting up a next trade even if it's on the same asset.\n\nOne more note on selling cause it can be way harder than it looks.\n\nCause agaiiiiin what to do if I sold too early?\n\nLet's say you are in huge profits and you are unsure what to do or maybe you were sure and sold but now you could've had more in the future.\n\nRelax, take a breather, celebrate and treat yo self. Definitely take a small break whether it's getting food by yourself or going hiking.\n\nYou are in a positive where you are doing great and have increased your financial security. Could you have had or would have potentially more? Sure. But again, remember to know your numbers and stick to your path and journey.\n\nWhat if it's the position you didn't expect to have?\n\nThat's even more neat. Use the newfound wealth and energy, that is not going to be spent on dwelling of coulde's shouldve's, to better your life. Remember, at the end of the day, money is a tool, a financial instrument, to help you achieve a fulfilling life, however, money by itself is nothing more than just a number. You probably don't even notice a difference besides the initial excitement post-selling.\n\nWell okay, you finally made it! But what about life?\n\nFocus on the important things you can't buy with money: physical and emotional health, being present, social life & some experiences.\n\nHealth. Please do not neglect your sleep. And yes, small things like a sleeping schedule count as well.\n\nBe present. Spend some time intentionally doing it daily. You have plenty of practices that can do that for you.\n\nMovement. Daily activity in any shape or form and, of course, it is important to take breaks even when you are pushing for your maximum potential.\n\nBut also don't forget about the things that you can buy with money: healthy food, therapy, and experiences.  \n\nFood plays a big part too in shaping up your day after day after day, thus your life. \n\nTherapy is a great tool to speed up your healing journey. One of the best r/r in the game of life.\n\nSocial life. Showing up is 80% of it. Initiate. Experiment. Enjoy it. Memories and experiences wit the right people would be worth more than any amount of money you could ever make.\n\nLastly, with all of that, you are still gonna fumble on the way and not even one time. Some of them would be the most obvious falls and fails, but only in hindsight. Just remember that It is life and it is okay. Remember to learn from your mistakes and keep going. You are going to make it either way.\n\nThis all leads to having a balanced life. Not only you are not going to outperform your unbalanced version but also you'll cultivate your life not just the financial/working part of life. Remember there's so much more to life than crypto or money and, in fact, at the end of the day it is those things that matter.\n\n\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve written something.
