It will replace the existing single dirt road which you had the misfortune of traveling on just now. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;With this new highway, we can ship our produce faster to the capital. We can have more tourists coming and staying at guest houses in our city. We can have more students and trainees from our village going to the capital and commuting back on a daily basis.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The mayor paused, beaming with pride expecting some encouraging comments. One of the Ethereum community members, his face red with anguish, shouts out &quot;you fucking idiot, have you not heard about induced demand? Building the highway is absolutely useless. The highway will be spammed by cattle farmers and their cows shitting every 10 feet. Within just a few months, the highway will be just as unusable as the dirt road is today. </p>\n\n<p>The chieftain listens with a worried look on his face. He nods and says, let me think about this, and then departs. Later that night, he googles the translation for induced demand. He has a sudden idea. He starts smiling again, the crease on his forehead now erased. Two weeks later, at the monthly city meeting, the mayor announces &quot;we shall no longer be building the highway. Induced demand is indeed a curse, the woes of which were taught to me by the handsome young foreigners&quot; He instead funnels the $300 million into his aunt&#39;s shrimp farm. Without a means of getting the shrimp to the capital where the largest seafood bazaar is held every week, the business eventually falters and bankrupts. But at least the remote African city wasn&#39;t cursed with the plight of induced demand.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-30 12:43:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kxaod0r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1braopv","parent_id":"t3_1braopv","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Epic shitpost","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Epic shitpost</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-30 19:48:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kxchlj8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1braopv","parent_id":"t1_kxaod0r","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/alexiskef","body":"Did anyone else think of our u/jtnichol when reading about the chieftain/mayor? \ud83d\ude02","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Did anyone else think of our <a href=\"/u/jtnichol\">u/jtnichol</a> when reading about the chieftain/mayor? \ud83d\ude02</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-30 17:28:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kxbxk7k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1braopv","parent_id":"t1_kxaod0r","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"I should record this.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I should record this.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-30 17:30:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kxbxui1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1braopv","parent_id":"t1_kxbxk7k","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"I know you're a proponent for raising the gas ceiling but we really need to (a) research the impact the increased bandwidth needs will have, (b) weigh increasing general block space gas limit vs blob space gas limit, and (c) make any increases in an incremental and controlled manner.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I know you&#39;re a proponent for raising the gas ceiling but we really need to (a) research the impact the increased bandwidth needs will have, (b) weigh increasing general block space gas limit vs blob space gas limit, and (c) make any increases in an incremental and controlled manner.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-30 21:29:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kxcu5a5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1braopv","parent_id":"t1_kxaod0r","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Syentist","body":"For a), if we were sincerely interested in this, client teams would have pushed out this basic info (which is really specific to each client implementation) a long time ago.
