I understand there are other types of income besides hobby and self-employment/business income. And obviously, things like W-2 wages from an employer or 1099 income are not subject to self-employment tax.\n\nBut when you are running an endeavor for your own personal benefit, you have two ways of classifying this activity: hobby or business.\n\n> I grow actual crops on my land. This isn't an example or metaphor. I grow corn and soybeans. We don't fertilize, plant or harvest the crops ourselves. We have a farmer that does all the work. We receive a portion of the crop which we then sell for money. We do not pay self-employment taxes on these profits, but we do it every year, and deliberately for money. It is not a hobby.\n\nThis doesn't disprove anything I'm saying, because you're not the one running an enterprise here. You're effectively renting out your land to someone else, for them to run their own business. If *you* were doing the actual work of farming the land, *you* would then have to decide whether you have a hobby or a business on your hands. And if you elected to treat it as a business, you would be subject to self-employment tax.\n\n> but I'm also not sure it makes sense since the actual work involved is a few hours a year in running updates. I think I spend more time per year clearing my field of debris before our farmer plants crops.\n\nI made this observation in my comments, i.e. that staking involves minimal effort and from that lens could be construed as a hobby. \n\nBut again, my main counter to that is that the IRS seems quite clear on this point: despite however much time/effort you are putting in, you cannot claim it's a hobby if you are generating a consistent or substantial profit from it. Specifically, the IRS is quite clear that you can't claim something is a hobby if you have generated a profit on it in 3 of the last 5 years. But even short of that, you shouldn't claim it as a hobby if you are deriving significant profits from it in any given year (although the IRS does seem a bit squishy on what would be considered significant).\n\n> I just started solo staking, so for 2023 most of my staking income was from Coinbase. I wonder if that makes the difference. \n\nAnd again, I agree that income on a 1099 from Coinbase wouldn't be subject to self-employment tax. You clearly didn't earn that income through your own efforts. It's neither a business nor a hobby of yours.\n\nBut solo staking is different. You're generating your own income through your own efforts. It's a hobby or a business. And per above, I don't think you could reasonably get away with calling it a hobby for more than a year or two at best.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>There are many forms of income that don&#39;t fall neatly into a business/hobby dichotomy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I never claimed otherwise. I understand there are other types of income besides hobby and self-employment/business income. And obviously, things like W-2 wages from an employer or 1099 income are not subject to self-employment tax.</p>\n\n<p>But when you are running an endeavor for your own personal benefit, you have two ways of classifying this activity: hobby or business.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I grow actual crops on my land. This isn&#39;t an example or metaphor. I grow corn and soybeans. We don&#39;t fertilize, plant or harvest the crops ourselves. We have a farmer that does all the work. We receive a portion of the crop which we then sell for money. We do not pay self-employment taxes on these profits, but we do it every year, and deliberately for money. It is not a hobby.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesn&#39;t disprove anything I&#39;m saying, because you&#39;re not the one running an enterprise here. You&#39;re effectively renting out your land to someone else, for them to run their own business. If <em>you</em> were doing the actual work of farming the land, <em>you</em> would then have to decide whether you have a hobby or a business on your hands. And if you elected to treat it as a business, you would be subject to self-employment tax.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>but I&#39;m also not sure it makes sense since the actual work involved is a few hours a year in running updates. I think I spend more time per year clearing my field of debris before our farmer plants crops.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I made this observation in my comments, i.e. that staking involves minimal effort and from that lens could be construed as a hobby. </p>\n\n<p>But again, my main counter to that is that the IRS seems quite clear on this point: despite however much time/effort you are putting in, you cannot claim it&#39;s a hobby if you are generating a consistent or substantial profit from it. Specifically, the IRS is quite clear that you can&#39;t claim something is a hobby if you have generated a profit on it in 3 of the last 5 years. But even short of that, you shouldn&#39;t claim it as a hobby if you are deriving significant profits from it in any given year (although the IRS does seem a bit squishy on what would be considered significant).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I just started solo staking, so for 2023 most of my staking income was from Coinbase. I wonder if that makes the difference. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And again, I agree that income on a 1099 from Coinbase wouldn&#39;t be subject to self-employment tax. You clearly didn&#39;t earn that income through your own efforts. It&#39;s neither a business nor a hobby of yours.</p>\n\n<p>But solo staking is different.

Now also imagine the fed funds rate is trending towards zero once again which seems to be a likely scenario given the realities of sovereign debt financing. In this environment a few bps of yield will still be competitively advantageous in an ETH staking ETF making it worth it to stake. Now consider the solo staker who can choose to do all the work of staking and overhead costs and get double taxed on income and cap gains for 1.5% apr or whatever instead of just buying staked ETH ETF shares in a tax advantaged account for likely net more after tax profit. </p>\n\n<p>This quoted assumption I think is core to the proposal and I think it is wrong or at least doesn&#39;t contemplate shifting macroeconomics sufficiently while myopically focusing on LIDO/LSTs. IMO they have always been the appetizer for the main event alignment wars down the road. If we want solo stakers they will need ammo to stave off the economies of scale. Otherwise we are just relying on altruism which is fragile over extended time frames. Lowering the technical and economic overhead to solo staking, and targeting changes that differentially incentivize solo stakers like correlation penalties are a much better approach IMO.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-01 17:40:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kxmnfli","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bsv48f","parent_id":"t1_kxli5o5","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Unbelievably values aligned solo staker here.
