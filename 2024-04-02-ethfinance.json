[Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) is up 82% in the past month. Renzo is up even 140%+. Of course this stake has to come from somewhere and apparently it's Lido validators leaving.

If we burn the MEV then solo stakers (and raw Eth holders) benefit from every bit of Eth destroyed - indirectly rewarding ALL eth holders and stakers equally.</p>\n\n<p>If we don&#39;t start taking this seriously there will be very few solo stakers left. I&#39;m a decentralization maximalist, that&#39;s one of the few reasons I even underwent the effort required to solo stake. But if I&#39;m not being properly compensated for my time or WORSE, I can spend no time and get a better APR by using a LST that benefits from economies of scale, then I truly am donating my time to the protocol for no additional financial incentive. I&#39;m a charitable person and am fully aligned ethos wise with the protocol, I didn&#39;t even activate MEV for a while (4-6 months) because I was (and am still) worried about the centralizing factors of the very limited amount of relays. If people like me are looking to leave solo staking I think we have much bigger problems. All of your questions are completely valid because solo stakers are going to continue to dwindle unless we setup our system to benefit solo stakers more than LSTs. If we only have LSTs then great, smart contracts are still ground breaking and Eth is still a great platform. But claiming it&#39;s decentralized would be false advertisement if there&#39;s 5 entities running the show that any government can go to and request censorship from.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-02 06:11:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kxoy3yk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1btqdwj","parent_id":"t1_kxopyfh","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I'll also be exiting my solo staked validators that have been going since genesis if issuance lowers\n\n\n\nThe risk (stress) to reward ratio isn't favorable to solo stakers as is.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ll also be exiting my solo staked validators that have been going since genesis if issuance lowers</p>\n\n<p>The risk (stress) to reward ratio isn&#39;t favorable to solo stakers as is.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-02 06:25:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kxp02zy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1btqdwj","parent_id":"t1_kxoy3yk","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"I hear you.
