Yesterday I decided I should try out the coinbase app and coinbase wallet app and do some typical DeFi things. I have used the coinbase app before, but not for a long time because I tend to do crypto on my desktop machine as a rule. I'd previously used the app to do some of the quests to earn a couple of dollars of coins, but nothing complex. Similarly the wallet app, I'd installed it and done a little bit, but nothing interesting. \n\nI thought I should give them another go, so yesterday I transferred $100 from my bank account and bought some ETH on coinbase. Then I sent it to a new coinbase wallet so I could do some DeFi. \n\nThe first thing I want to get off my chest is the coinbase app is bad; really bad. It is so difficult to use even in simple mode. It's not quite as bad as the desktop experience but it's close. All the buttons do the same thing: Home, My Assets and Trade all have some combination of the same options to buy, sell, convert, send, receive. Then you click through to buy and you get the same options to buy, sell, convert. It's so, so difficult to understand where you are in the workflow. I understand their objective is to get you to click those buttons so they earn their fees, but man it's hard work. They also have a \"cash out\" button, which just adds to the casino experience and isn't helping anyone in an industry already struggling for legitimacy. \n\nMoving on, I sent the ETH to my new coinbase wallet. This was reasonably straightforward, I could open the wallet app and easily link my wallet to my coinbase account and transfer across. This was a little janky but that's understandable as it's crossing the  custodial/non-custodial boundary, and I've seen the recent ETH Denver presentation where they're working on smoothing this out. I'm excited for that, getting retail-ready. I sent my ETH on base and that was cheap, easy and quick. \n\nThe wallet app is, unfortunately, about as difficult to navigate as the coinbase app. There are multiple tabs within tabs: Assets, browser, explore, buy, swap, bridge... it's hard work understanding what they all do. There's also a chat button with notifications, which I presume is scam central so that's bad news. \n\nThe browser tab attempts to give you everything: uniswap, balancer, opensea, rarible, curve, lido, synthetix, and a million things I've never heard of. Retail will get slaughtered here, there is no chance in hell they can take all this in, and that's before they've even clicked into any of the dapps! What hope have they got understanding Aave flashloans when they are given access to everything all at once?\n\nThis needs simplifying, and aggregator apps need to do the heavy lifting. If I want crypto to be my savings account I want to see an interest rate. If I want crypto to play shitcoin roulette I want something like 1inch to get me as many coins as possible for my money, but I don't want to know about it. If I want to buy jpegs I don't want to have to navigate through 5 different apps to see them all and all at different prices depending on whether they're listed on blur, opensea or rarible, or if my money is on the wrong network and the nft is on base, polygon, optimism.... \n\nUsers also aren't going to understand smart contracts have vulnerabilities and they could lose all their money. Coinbase need to become the Apple app store walled garden for dapps. Ever read an EULA? Me neither. If I put my salary into a dapp I see on coinbase I expect my money to be safe. \n\nI was feeling a little jaded by now, but what I really wanted to do was get to curve and deposit into a pool. \n\nI used the in-app trade function and traded ETH for $10 of USDC. That cost ~$0.18, I won't go into the fees, I know work is being done to reduce them, but compared to mainnet it's drops in the ocean. I found my way to curve and deposited my $10USDC into a pool for a tx cost of $0.05 including approval tx! Now that is what I'm here for. Typically when I'm using curve I will mentally allocate $100 for fees, and this was five cents! I could jump around pools all day and spend less than five dollars. That bit felt awesome, I was doing complex DeFi operations with real money for 5 cents. The cost of being my own bank is no longer hundreds of dollars and the DeFi know-how. It's now next to nothing in monetary terms, it's all down to the education of what these tools are and how to use them. \n\nGen Z and Gen \u0391lpha will take to this like ducks to water once the onboarding flow is smoothed out.\n\nTl;dr: coinbase app = bad UX.
