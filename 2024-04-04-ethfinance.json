It is not in a Dex pool, nothing you are holding is being bought or sold. What you are holding is a claim token that will be worth the face value of underlying at expiry. E.g. Normally 1 PT-rswETH-June28-2024 will be worth 1 rswETh at expiry. The reason you buy this is people sell it at a discount. So you might pick some up at 0.85 rswETH, hold it for a few months at a 60% APR, and claim at expiry.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-04 09:42:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ky1ajmi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bveuv9","parent_id":"t1_ky01nqn","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Fair_Raccoon9333","body":"Contract risk mostly, the smaller risk your YT position could substantially shrink in value.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Contract risk mostly, the smaller risk your YT position could substantially shrink in value.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-04 06:23:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ky0c56a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bveuv9","parent_id":"t1_ky01nqn","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/danekshea","body":"But when you provide, there\u2019s an option to do it solely with a PT position?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>But when you provide, there\u2019s an option to do it solely with a PT position?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-04 07:47:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ky0psmo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bveuv9","parent_id":"t1_ky0c56a","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Fair_Raccoon9333","body":"Yes","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-04 07:55:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ky0r9ig","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bveuv9","parent_id":"t1_ky0psmo","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/danekshea","body":"In that case you don\u2019t have a YT position though?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In that case you don\u2019t have a YT position though?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-04 07:56:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ky0rdq3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bveuv9","parent_id":"t1_ky0r9ig","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Fair_Raccoon9333","body":"In essence you are selling your YT position and taking a PT only position, but yes.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In essence you are selling your YT position and taking a PT only position, but yes.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-04 07:57:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ky0rnwg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bveuv9","parent_id":"t1_ky0rdq3","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/danekshea","body":"But you already have that if you have a PT position?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>But you already have that if you have a PT position?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-04 07:58:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ky0rqtu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bveuv9","parent_id":"t1_ky0rnwg","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Fair_Raccoon9333","body":"I am not sure I understand.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am not sure I understand.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-04 07:59:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ky0s154","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bveuv9","parent_id":"t1_ky0rqtu","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/danekshea","body":"You buy a PT position, you then provide liquidity with that PT position.

Here in the US there's this point of national pride they try to imprint on you that the US was founded on principals of freedom and somehow spreads the torch of freedom around the world. There's the bill of rights they trot out, right to free speech etc. A pedantic point I sometime raise with people is that if something is discretionally permitted by the government, it is not a true freedom. Right to free speech? Not if you yell fire in a crowded room, start a riot, libel, slander, etc. If a judge *can* issue a gag order, speech itself is not a freedom; it is *permitted*. Driving is not a right; it is permitted. Owning a firearm is not a right, it is permitted, despite what all the 2A folks want to believe.\n\nIn terms of true freedoms, you have very few true ones and even amongst your permitted rights they are often being deprecated by technology. For example you had the right to privacy, the government couldn't open your USPS mail without a warrant. This is still technically true, but the vast majority of mail has instead become email and the US doesn't need a warrant to scry that. You had the freedom to transact with cash, but increasingly every payment is digital and those rights don't carry over. We hear frequently stories of people that go to deposit to a bank and have the deposit frozen. You have to report transactions over $10k, which practically means less and less expensive things in purchasing power each year due to inflation. Legislative inaction and judicial activism, in the face of technological progress, are eroding what few permitted freedoms we still have.\n\nThe notion that everything every citizen does should be permitted is attractive to those who wield power. They want you to have to ask their permission so they can say no and only permit actions that preserve or expand their position of power and at a time and place most convenient for them. The days tick by and the vice constraining what you are allowed to do silently tightens each day. The people who need freedoms the most are those with the most controversial ideas, the ones most likely to destabilize the status quo; for good or ill.\n\nPeople like Warren fundamentally disagree with me on the freedom to transact. They want the freedom to transact to fully transition to a permitted freedom. They make arguments like \"equal playing field\" with the banks that are already wound in the straight jacket for them. They argue that the only people who need these freedoms are those with malicious intent. They reductively argue that blockchains are financing North Korea and child porn. Of course, they are only here to protect us. It's very much analogous to the \"nothing to hide\" arguments you get from the surveillance state encroaching on your right to privacy and it's every bit as ethically wrong. They couldn't be further from the founding principals of this nation if they tried.\n\nYour transactions are an expression of your values. You invest in things you believe in, you buy things that add value to your life, you donate to causes you hold dear. Limiting your transactions is fundamentally an attack on your ability to express your values and shape the world to align with them. The moral compass of crypto is a controversial one, precisely because it bucks the trend and creates true freedom; for good or ill. So yes, there are scammers abound, memecoins with deliberately hateful content, and rugs every day but there are also people escaping the oppressive inflation of their nation state, financing art and innovation, and eroding the role parasitic middlemen plaguing our society.\n\nSo, asking for permission simply won\u2019t do.
