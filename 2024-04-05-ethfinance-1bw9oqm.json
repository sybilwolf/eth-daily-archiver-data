They have been audited by some of the top names in the biz like Sigma Prime and ABDK. While other protocols spread themselves thin, they have honed in on their core product with the understanding that simple = secure. Just stay away from their stablecoin strategies atm (IMO). \n\n2. *Capped borrow rates*. In Aave and other lending markets, variable borrow rates can skyrocket as an asset's utilization rate approaches 90+%. Theoretically this will balance out as more capital flows in to take advantage of the high yields, but there is still the uncertainty of how much interest you'll be paying on your debt. Gearbox caps their collateral utilization at 90%, which means that you'll pay *no more* than \\~31% APR on your weETH debt, as determined by their DAO. This can also be a con, as I'll discuss later.\n\n3. *Time insensitive*. In Pendle, the YT strategy is dependent on each project's time to TGE. With [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) we have a little more certainty since we know how long Season 2 lasts, but for argument's sake let's just say that you've just yeeted 10 ETH into YT on Pendle's eETH 27 Jun 2024 market. You get exposure to \\~130 eETH and after doing some math you decide that 130 eETH worth of points over 86 days will provide a nice return. However, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) suddenly decides to pivot and end Season 2 a week from now. The price of YT crumbles and you've barely had any time to accrue any points. This risk (almost) doesn't exist with the gearbox strategy, because your main cost (debt) accrues at the same time as your main income (points), so you can simply unroll your position after the airdrop whether that's tomorrow or three months from now. I'll get into the \"almost\" bit later.\n\n**Risks and disclaimers**\n\n1. The main catch here is that this is a capped strategy. You have to wait until the ETH borrow rate comes under 90% to get in. I was lucky that there was some space not too long ago, but you'll have to watch this like a hawk. They have an ezETH leverage strategy as well, but that is capped too.\n\n2. She's a gaz guzzler. Expect to pay $100-200 in gas to set this up, depending on prices.\n\n3. When I said it was time-insensitive, that wasn't entirely true. If you take on 8x leverage, your health ratio will be 1.044. With your debt growing at 30% interest, this is a ticking time bomb until  your health ratio reaches 1 and you get liquidated. My advice is to do no more than 7x leverage and keep an eye on it, adding capital or reducing debt as necessary.\n\n4. This is all dependent on points! Who tf knows what's gonna happen. We don't know how EigenLayer and Szn2 ethfi are going to handle whales. With this leverage you might get into big boy territory and that could cap your gains. My conservative estimates on point values could be wildly wrong. ETHFI could crash between now and June. EigenLayer could flop. Smart contract risk. Solar flares. Sharknados. Ahh!\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSomeone please double check my work. I could be missing something glaring. Also, DYOR. I've got holes in my brain and I haven't seen the sun in like 3 days, but hopefully we're all a little richer by the end of this thing.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><h1>Part 2/2</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Why I prefer this method to other points farming strategies</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><em>Gearbox is solid</em>. They have been audited by some of the top names in the biz like Sigma Prime and ABDK. While other protocols spread themselves thin, they have honed in on their core product with the understanding that simple = secure. Just stay away from their stablecoin strategies atm (IMO). </p></li>\n<li><p><em>Capped borrow rates</em>. In Aave and other lending markets, variable borrow rates can skyrocket as an asset&#39;s utilization rate approaches 90+%. Theoretically this will balance out as more capital flows in to take advantage of the high yields, but there is still the uncertainty of how much interest you&#39;ll be paying on your debt. Gearbox caps their collateral utilization at 90%, which means that you&#39;ll pay <em>no more</em> than ~31% APR on your weETH debt, as determined by their DAO. This can also be a con, as I&#39;ll discuss later.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Time insensitive</em>. In Pendle, the YT strategy is dependent on each project&#39;s time to TGE. With <a href=\"http://ether.fi\">ether.fi</a> we have a little more certainty since we know how long Season 2 lasts, but for argument&#39;s sake let&#39;s just say that you&#39;ve just yeeted 10 ETH into YT on Pendle&#39;s eETH 27 Jun 2024 market. You get exposure to ~130 eETH and after doing some math you decide that 130 eETH worth of points over 86 days will provide a nice return. However, <a href=\"http://ether.fi\">ether.fi</a> suddenly decides to pivot and end Season 2 a week from now. The price of YT crumbles and you&#39;ve barely had any time to accrue any points. This risk (almost) doesn&#39;t exist with the gearbox strategy, because your main cost (debt) accrues at the same time as your main income (points), so you can simply unroll your position after the airdrop whether that&#39;s tomorrow or three months from now. I&#39;ll get into the &quot;almost&quot; bit later.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Risks and disclaimers</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The main catch here is that this is a capped strategy. You have to wait until the ETH borrow rate comes under 90% to get in. I was lucky that there was some space not too long ago, but you&#39;ll have to watch this like a hawk. They have an ezETH leverage strategy as well, but that is capped too.</p></li>\n<li><p>She&#39;s a gaz guzzler. Expect to pay $100-200 in gas to set this up, depending on prices.</p></li>\n<li><p>When I said it was time-insensitive, that wasn&#39;t entirely true. If you take on 8x leverage, your health ratio will be 1.044. With your debt growing at 30% interest, this is a ticking time bomb until  your health ratio reaches 1 and you get liquidated. My advice is to do no more than 7x leverage and keep an eye on it, adding capital or reducing debt as necessary.</p></li>\n<li><p>This is all dependent on points! Who tf knows what&#39;s gonna happen. We don&#39;t know how EigenLayer and Szn2 ethfi are going to handle whales. With this leverage you might get into big boy territory and that could cap your gains. My conservative estimates on point values could be wildly wrong. ETHFI could crash between now and June. EigenLayer could flop. Smart contract risk. Solar flares. Sharknados. Ahh!</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Someone please double check my work. I could be missing something glaring. Also, DYOR. I&#39;ve got holes in my brain and I haven&#39;t seen the sun in like 3 days, but hopefully we&#39;re all a little richer by the end of this thing.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-05 04:25:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ky5li68","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bw9oqm","parent_id":"t1_ky5lhdm","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"Great writeup!
