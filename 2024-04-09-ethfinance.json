It's so good I'm literally just cleaning it up and transcribing it here:\n\nFHE is complementary to zk-proofs. Zk-proofs say that I did the calculation honestly. We can prove something like I calculated 4+5 honestly and you don't have to go and rerun it yourself to get the answer to that. FHE can be used for many things outside of AI but it's especially valuable for things like DePin.\n\nFor example Biometric Authorization. When you want to take your thumbprint or eyeprint and use that as an authorization mechanism. You don't want to give someone your decrypted eyeprint. Today, without FHE, we encrypt your data in transit so the people in the middle can't get it, then we decrypt it on the receiving side, and then the person on the receiving side now has your decrypted eyeprint and can basically just impersonate you. There is fundamentally trust with whomever is the processor of your data.\n\nWith FHE, we can give you an encrypted eyeprint, they can check that your eyeprint is actually you, without knowing it's you. They don't have something that can be reused. So they can do authorization without you leaking your public data.\n\nThe same thing would be true if I was in healthcare and wanted to make health predictions about you. If I know it's you and you give me all your health data what am I going to do? As a centralized provider I'm going to take that data, I'm going to jot it down, and then I'm going to sell it on the data market to some health insurance companies so they can jack up your rates.\n\nAs a user, I want the output of the LLM that tells me what might be wrong with me without the processor of the data being able to jot it down and sell it maliciously against me and add that extra monetization. The same thing would be true in a lot of places. It should be true throughout all of web2. This should explode and become mandatory in certain environments where privacy should be sacrosanct. But in DePin especially, because of permissionless compute, I can't even just say I trust Amazon. I have no idea who the processor of the data is and due to market forces it is going to devolve into the most malicious operator who is able to extract the most monetization out of the data they steal.\n\nSo for DePin to be applicable to any area where there is the remotest sense of secrecy or privacy we need to be able to do calculation on an untrusted operator and both prove that they did the calculation honestly (zk-proof) and that they didn't have access to the underlying data (FHE). So you put these two technologies together and you get something that can eat into the margins of centralized compute providers like AWS in a significant way.\n\nTo put their margins in perspective, a P5 instance on AWS right now is $92 an hour. I can buy that machine for about $350k. At $92 an hour that's over $800k a year, Amazon is making over 200% APR on the investment of the machine. There is an extraordinarily huge margin there and the effect of that is that the highest grade of compute we have isn't democratized and therefore the apps that require that grade of compute are increasingly being centralized into a few tech oligarchs.\n\nDue to the compute requirements, this basically translates to AI. So we're seeing brick wall around AI being built every time we add another parameter to the LLM. Chat GPT was 1.5B parameters; it takes about 13 gigs of video ram to hold and use the model. Chat GPT 4 is bigger. We're going to go to a trillion parameters. We're going to get to a point where you need to have hundreds of gigs of video ram just to serve on the model and that's not going to be accessible to the average person. The average person isn't going to buy a half million dollar machine from NVidia. We need to be able to provide that high end compute to them at a lower margin than AWS is charging.\n\nThat is both an opportunity and a moral imperative of Defi and Depin. We need to make the compute required to access the technologies we are pioneering more democratically accessible before they become permanently locked behind brick wall and only accessible to a few tech oligarchs and used in their most extractive possible way against humanity.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So on the EVM call last Friday <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/xYQWGTENc5o?si=wpGZ4V2vlXN3s5o3&amp;t=4624\">I went on a rant</a> for a few minutes after JT read my doot.
