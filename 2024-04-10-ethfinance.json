I had just finished reading u/AElowsson 's [analysis](https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-curve-with-tempered-issuance-eip-research-post/19171) and I think I understand more clearly what's really at stake (heh) here. I have to admit my initial reaction when I read the proposal was pretty negative, so in order to help others make up their mind and also keep track of all the arguments that I see, I've made a list of the pros and cons as I've understood them, and explained them as simply as possible. If there are any more that you can think of and ELI5, I'll be happy to add them to the list.\n\n**Pros of issuance change:**\n\n- The network stability benefits from an optimal number of validators, as it's more difficult for a huge number of validators to effectively attest blocks fast enough.\n\n- The ETH that remains in circulation is not superseded by LSTs, which apart from having smart contract, centralization and rugpull risks, make the LST a proxy for ETH. As a result, ETH does not lose its \"moneyness\" in the eyes of its users.\n\n- Non-stakers benefit immensely from an issuance reduction. Currently, non-stakers benefit from the burn by having an effective ~0.5% APY, and at the same time, stakers get >3%. However, as more ETH is staked, non-stakers end up not benefiting at all as more and more rewards go to stakers, who at a minimum will be getting 2% at 100% ETH staked.\n\n- The more ETH is staked, the harder it will be to implement this change. This is due to several reasons, most important of which is that big staking providers have a huge incentive to block it. Lido has already come out in favour of *ALL ETH* being staked and wanting as much of it to be stETH. What would happen in a post-staked ETH ETF world, when BlackRock lobbies against implementing a change to issuance?\n\n**Unclear if issuance change will be a pro or a con:**\n\n- It is not clear how this change will affect the dynamics between solo/hobby stakers and huge staking services. On one hand, there's definitely a limit where solo stakers would exit, and if the staking pools manage to profit though other means, the APY could be very negative and drive all solo stakers out. On the other hand, a market optimized APY leaves less space for staking pools to get a cut of the profits, and if solo stakers eventually have all the ways to profit through other means as big pools, they might be more resistant to low APY.  Personally, I would keep a validator up even at half a percent APY, but would not keep my validator up at, say, -5% APY.\n\n-  Fewer ETH staked means less economic security for a network that aims to secure trillions of dollars of assets. However, those fewer ETH can end up having more economic value in the long term due to a more robust and valuable network, so the end result is not immediately clear.\n\n**Cons of issuance change:**\n\n- Changing the issuance *again* will lead to huge amounts of FUD, and ETH losing some of its \"moneyness\" due to the belief that the EF can unilaterally change the monetary supply.\n\n- It's definitely not good optics at a time when the SEC is investigating and will be pretty bad for our hopes for an ETF.\n\n- The issuance can and probably will need to be changed again. The main reason is that there are economics we simply do not understand, like the effect restaking will have on the amount of ETH staked. Also, the amount of validators might go down *significantly* with EIP-7251 (max-ETH per validator), leading the network to require more validators to be sufficiently decentralized. Finally, there are ideas for future updates that, if implemented, will significanly alter the economics of ETH. MEV-burn is one frequently discussed here, but the [Anti-correlation Penalties for validator attestations](https://ethresear.ch/t/analysis-on-correlated-attestation-penalties/19244), which in my understanding disincentivizes big staking providers by implementing heavier penalties when lots of validators lose an attestation at the same time, will most probably also affect the number of validators and the staking pool-solo staker dynamics.\n\n---Personal opinion below---\n\nSo here is my view now: I am still mostly on the fence regarding the *immediate* (see:Pectra) issuance curve change, but at the same time **I want to come out in support of an eventual change of the issuance curve**  towards one where staking much more than 50% of the supply is heavily disincentivized by negative issuance.\n\nThe main reason for this is that most of the disadvantages of changing the issuance are short-term troubles, and won't have any effect on the long-term longevity of Ethereum. I'd rather see the project succeed and change the world, than make a bit more money for a year or five. \"I'm in it for the tech\" might be a meme, but it's also the best way to analyze long-term investments, and it would be much easier for me to leave a project that has ossified before being finished, than it would be to leave because the price dumped. Changing Ethereum's issuance will not only make it a more robust network, but also better money, especially for smaller holders that cannot stake. \n\nETH needs to keep changing for the better, so don't sacrifice the future to the present. That's what Bitcoin did, and apart from the fact that it will have huge issues eventually, it ended up being only a shadow of what it could be.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Today&#39;s Bankless discussion came at the perfect time.

I agree with you that changing issuance is short-term pain for long-term gain. Here is some input:   </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As discussed in Section 5.1, while economic security may somewhat benefit in the short run by pushing up the quantity staked with high issuance, in the long run, it may actually be detrimental to economic security (a less valuable token is not able to provide as much economic security).</li>\n<li>It is not clear to me that issuance will need to be changed again (depending on if you refer to k=2^25 or 2^26,  the observed effect, and the future of MEV burn). This is a complex topic to speculate about. </li>\n<li>The number of validators itself does not affect real decentralization.</li>\n<li>You are correct about non-stakers benefiting. And this may also benefit everyone, as argued in for example Section 6.4.</li>\n<li>It is not sure that solo stakers care less about APY, this is in my mind a topic open for debate (e.g., Section 4.2).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-10 17:28:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kz079vt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1c0dgy2","parent_id":"t1_kyzga3i","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"As a temporary measure why not set a validator/staked eth cap instead of changing the curve and putting so much into question? then after a few of these updates get through like maxEB, MEV burn, and anti-correlation penalties and restaking landscape has a chance to mature you revisit this.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As a temporary measure why not set a validator/staked eth cap instead of changing the curve and putting so much into question? then after a few of these updates get through like maxEB, MEV burn, and anti-correlation penalties and restaking landscape has a chance to mature you revisit this.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-10 18:13:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kz0edvy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1c0dgy2","parent_id":"t1_kz079vt","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Itur_ad_Astra","body":"I've moved the economic security and solo stakers benefiting points to a neutral category.
