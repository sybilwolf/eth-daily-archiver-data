That is, you can have a validator staking 32-2048 ETH.  \n\n\nThe question is *how do users get their rewards if they can't/are unwilling to provide the max 2048 ETH into a single validator?* They shouldn't be forced to either un-stake everything or wait until their balance reaches 2048 ETH.\n\nThere are two proposed options.\n\n1. Allow users to set their own custom ceiling, such as 34.625 ETH. All ETH above that will be skimmed into their preferred Eth address. This is more work/complexity for the developers and staking pools. When asked about this option, staking pools don't really care if this is included or not. In my opinion this is best for solo validators because they don't have to spend any ETH to get their rewards.\n\n2. Don't have this custom ceiling and make users sign a transaction indicating that they want to withdrawal, say, 1.257 ETH. As long as their balance remains above 32 ETH after their withdrawal and they pay a high enough fee they will be included into a block eventually. Each block will have a target of 2 user-initiated withdrawals, and there will be a fee that will increase/decrease depending on demand. This is detrimental to solo validators and smaller pools because paying a fee is disproportionately affects these smaller entities.\n\n\n\nI am making the case for option 1. We *must* allow users to set a custom ceiling for the sake of solo validators.\n\nWHY?\n\n**1. I think it's important for the Ethereum protocol to help solo validators** ***as much as reasonably*** **possible.**\n\n* Solo validators are the lifeblood of Ethereum. They are the most decentralized in terms of geography, internet provider, hardware, and client distribution. In my opinion, the solo validator community is the most aligned to Ethereum because they are choosing to forgo the safety and benefits of pooling their stake for what can be presumed decentralization's sake. Additionally, they retain their voting power and don't delegate it to these huge pools that can potentially be swayed to chase short-term profits to the long-term detriment of Ethereum.\n\n**2. The manual withdrawal mechanism can be spammed by large actors to the detriment of small actors whether it be solo validators** ***or*** **smaller competitor pools.**\n\n* If we do not have a custom ceiling, then partial rewards must be manually withdrawn as a new type of transaction. There would be a target of 2 withdrawals per block with a fee mechanism like EIP-1559. It would be a real shame if large pools 'nudged' smaller pools or solo validators to consolidate with the big pools by keeping the fee to withdraw high. Additionally, there are *a lot* of validators, so even honest withdrawals would keep that fee high.\n* Finally, we know that pools are *likely* to use these new transactions a lot because they are not likely to consolidate their validators to the max 2048 for slashing protection. They are likely to consolidate maybe 10-20 validators so let's say 320 ETH. They would need to withdrawal ETH every time a user wanted their ETH back, or every time a consolidated validator needed to be brought back down to their 320 ETH comfort zone.\n\n  \nTL;DR I want to protect and encourage the solo validator as much as possible, and this extra option protects the solo validator's interest which outstrips the downside of added complexity. The cost of writing and testing the code only needs to be paid once, but protecting solo validators provides dividends to Ethereum for generations.\n\n  \nHere is a summary of the details as they [stand.](https://hackmd.io/@philknows/S1JbLXmlA) Let me know if you have any opinions on the matter.
