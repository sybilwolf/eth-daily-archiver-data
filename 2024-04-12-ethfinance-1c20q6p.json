So risk profile I would say is much lower than what some other people are doing with their ETH.  Just seems like it's lacking the time-tested nature of tier-1 protocols like Aave and Maker, which hopefully will come with time. Obviously yes there could be a bug in there that hasn't yet been exploited and it's clearly more risky than pure staking, but it's clearly not like an outright scam or anything in terms of APRs being way off or anything like that.  It's been working for people without issue.
