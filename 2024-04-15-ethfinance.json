They thought that Blobs should have totally disentangled the gas price on mainnet and on rollups. Rollup gas prices and mainnet gas prices still are correlated and here is an explainer why:\n\nAll rollups have to post some part onto the Ethereum mainnet which costs mainnet gas. For the case of zksync they have to post the merkle root of the new state as well as the validity proof of the new state to the Ethereum mainnet. The validity proof also gets executed on mainnet to proof it is correct, which costs additional gas. Up until blobs, rollups also published all transaction raw data as calldata on the mainnet. This calldata cost alone was somewhere around 85% to 95% of all fees one had to pay for a L2 transaction. The cost for publishing this calldata went to zero with blobs. The other 2 (posting merkle roots and validity proofs) are still here. That is why the gas fees on Rollups are still non-zero even though blob costs pretty much are (1 wei). \n\nIf there is a spike in the mainnet gas fees, this obviously increases the costs for publishing merkle roots and validity proofs which need to be paid by all rollup users. Rollups have a pretty involved way to spread the cost over all their users as well as over time, therefore it is hard to say how much a Rollup fee increases when the mainnet fee increasses a certain amount. \n\nAn additional mechanism for L2 gas fee correllation is through the increased activity during high volatility. If prices fall in a short period a lot of positions need to be liquidated, exchange rates need to be arbitraged, positions need to be saved and falling knives need to be caught. This increases the activity on mainnet as well as on Rollups which increases the gas fees on the rollup through an EIP-1559 like mechanism for the rollup itself.
