Payments from AVSs to operators are disabled, and slashing is disabled.</p>\n\n<p>So, operators can&#39;t meaningfully compete on making smart choices with AVS selection because choices are few and somewhat outside of their control. They can&#39;t compete on APY because payments aren&#39;t operational. They can&#39;t compete on trust/security because slashing is disabled. And for payments/slashing, they&#39;re largely not even implemented at this point, so it&#39;s hard to speculate on how much $$ we <em>would</em> have made or how much <em>would</em> have been slashed--it&#39;s not described yet. Feels like a testnet setup that happens to be deployed on mainnet.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>That&#39;s what operators have to think about, and it&#39;s not too hard to spin that around to see the situation from a restaker&#39;s perspective. There&#39;s just not much you can look at right now to judge an operator&#39;s EigenLayer behavior and performance. And restaking to an operator has little effect at this point: just signaling support, and helping the operator use their delegated ETH numbers to gain access to larger shares of more AVSs.</p>\n\n<p>I think what you can do now is mainly just what you&#39;ve already started: judging operators by their past performance in other projects, general vibes, and maybe any statements they&#39;ve made regarding their operator plans (if they can say anything definitive at this point). Then cross your fingers and hope that it translates to their decisions as an operator. But for now it&#39;s all kinda \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-18 00:27:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l041dmr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1c6v2o5","parent_id":"t1_l03ooit","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/monkeyhold99","body":"Great response.
