That's like me saying you support TikTok not being banned because you think it's good for a developing child's brain. You never fucking said that just like I never said what you suggested I said.\n\nAlso, your response to my argument is that \"that's not the reason it's being banned.\" That literally doesn't matter.

The USA and Europe are closely aligned allies. China on the other hand pushes agendas directly opposed to the west's geopolitical interests. In a worst case scenario that means that it's WW3 at stake here.\n\nStep 1: China changes the algorithm to take attention away from Ukraine and puts extra focus on stupid wars we shouldn't be involved in like Isreal/Palestine.\n\nStep 2: The American people vote in an isolationist candidate in the upcoming election.\n\nStep 3: Ukraine falls due to a lack of western support.\n\nStep 4: Russia invades Moldova (they already occupy Transnistria and Moldova isn't a NATO member). Minimal western pushback happens as Europe isn't strong enough alone. Russia sees no reason to stop.\n\nStep 5: Russia invades the baltic states knowing that article 5 of NATO, contrary to popular belief only invokes member states to support the invaded country with whatever support each country deems necessary. America, now an isolationist does a token act of support like sending helmets. But the baltic states are EU member states and the EU has a defence clause stating that an attack on one state is an attack on all and all must help out with all the power they have.\n\nStep 6: The EU is now at war with Russia and China takes this opportunity to invade Taiwan. But western resources are stretched and the US who is already selling their munitions to Europe (even as an isolationist they will still sell weapons, they'll just stop sending aid as a long term investment to prop up allied regimes). Consequently they won't have an easy time coming to Taiwan's defence.\n\nThe war doesn't go nuclear because would France really risk Paris for Talinn? Of course not so it would stay conventional unless there is an accidental escalation. Even if the EU loses, Russia will likely stop at its historical border at the baltic in the north, the Carpathian mountains in the south and having closed the Siwalki gap in between.\n\nThis is obviously very hypothetical but the key is that it all starts with information warfare because the everyday person in the west's collective opinion makes a difference on western foreign policy. That is what is at stake here and there is no shortage of evidence that China is already pushing certain narratives on TikTok, hence the incredibly disproportionate pro-Palestine content vs pro-Isreal content on TikTok.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Wait...
