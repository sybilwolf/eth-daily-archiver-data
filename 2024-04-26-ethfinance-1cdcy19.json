An individual with 32 ETH and a validator running in their home qualifies, unless you consider MEV-Boost to be an outsourcing of either type of duty to a third party.

Validators are like digital guardians who ensure transactions on Ethereum are valid and secure. However, currently, there are some issues with how validation is done that Heroglyphs aims to solve.\n\nHere's a simplified breakdown:\n\n1. \\*\\*Current Problem\\*\\*: Right now, Ethereum validation is split between those who own Ethereum tokens (economic contributors) and those who validate transactions (validation contributors). This split can lead to centralization, where only a few big players control the validation process.\n\n2. \\*\\*What Heroglyphs Does\\*\\*: It introduces a way for validators to earn rewards beyond just validating transactions. It does this by allowing validators to include special messages (Graffiti) in the blocks they validate. These messages can encode valuable information.\n\n3. \\*\\*How it Works\\*\\*: Heroglyphs has two main parts:\n\n   - \\*\\*Encoder\\*\\*: This part helps validators put useful information in their Graffiti.\n\n   - \\*\\*Translator\\*\\*: It takes the encoded information from Graffiti and turns it into actions on Ethereum, like creating or transferring tokens.\n\n4. \\*\\*Why it's Called Heroglyphs\\*\\*: The name is a mix of \"hero\" (representing the journey validators go through) and \"hieroglyphs\" (which are symbols used in ancient writing). It's about making validators more valuable and returning to the principles of decentralization and fairness.\n\n5. \\*\\*Benefits\\*\\*: By using Heroglyphs, smaller validators can earn rewards regardless of their stake size. This helps make Ethereum more secure and diverse, reducing the risk of control by a few big players.\n\n6. \\*\\*Future Potential\\*\\*: Heroglyphs could lead to more fair and decentralized systems beyond just token mining. It could also help merge some benefits of Proof of Work (like fair token distribution) into Proof of Stake networks like Ethereum.\n\nIn summary, Heroglyphs aims to make Ethereum validation more inclusive and secure by rewarding validators with additional incentives beyond just validating transactions.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I threw the unclassified whitepaper into ChatGPT asking for an ELI5 and this is what has been thrown back at me:</p>\n\n<p>The Heroglyphs Protocol is a system designed to encourage more people to help secure the Ethereum network by becoming validators. Validators are like digital guardians who ensure transactions on Ethereum are valid and secure. However, currently, there are some issues with how validation is done that Heroglyphs aims to solve.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a simplified breakdown:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>**Current Problem**: Right now, Ethereum validation is split between those who own Ethereum tokens (economic contributors) and those who validate transactions (validation contributors). This split can lead to centralization, where only a few big players control the validation process.</p></li>\n<li><p>**What Heroglyphs Does**: It introduces a way for validators to earn rewards beyond just validating transactions. It does this by allowing validators to include special messages (Graffiti) in the blocks they validate. These messages can encode valuable information.</p></li>\n<li><p>**How it Works**: Heroglyphs has two main parts:</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>**Encoder**: This part helps validators put useful information in their Graffiti.</p></li>\n<li><p>**Translator**: It takes the encoded information from Graffiti and turns it into actions on Ethereum, like creating or transferring tokens.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>**Why it&#39;s Called Heroglyphs**: The name is a mix of &quot;hero&quot; (representing the journey validators go through) and &quot;hieroglyphs&quot; (which are symbols used in ancient writing). It&#39;s about making validators more valuable and returning to the principles of decentralization and fairness.</p></li>\n<li><p>**Benefits**: By using Heroglyphs, smaller validators can earn rewards regardless of their stake size. This helps make Ethereum more secure and diverse, reducing the risk of control by a few big players.</p></li>\n<li><p>**Future Potential**: Heroglyphs could lead to more fair and decentralized systems beyond just token mining. It could also help merge some benefits of Proof of Work (like fair token distribution) into Proof of Stake networks like Ethereum.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In summary, Heroglyphs aims to make Ethereum validation more inclusive and secure by rewarding validators with additional incentives beyond just validating transactions.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-26 11:55:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l1e5h0j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cdcy19","parent_id":"t1_l1ddxxo","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Another day, same regulatory spasms - business as usual.

If there is no change in administration on Nov, I would be extremely comfortable in betting on no change in the regulatory clarity of ETH/rest of non-BTC tokens nor any other spot ETFs until 2028. If there is a change in administration, a Pierce led SEC would likely withdraw the suits against CB/Kraken in Q1 2025, issuers would file new spot ETF applications in Q2, and we&#39;d probably have spot ETFs in Q3/Q4 2025. The election being on a razor edge is a wild card which makes a decisive bet on either direction much harder for now.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-26 02:59:38","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-04-26 03:02:54","id":"l1bv4k1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cdcy19","parent_id":"t3_1cdcy19","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/barthib","body":"Staking is not in question.
