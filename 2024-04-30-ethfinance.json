So congrats to those with access to a good amount of EIGEN, and my condolences to those who feel rugged by the distribution parameters and/or geographical/IP blocking.\n\nThe more interesting topic for me is the release of the [EIGEN token whitepaper](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/whitepaper/blob/master/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper.pdf). The authors present EIGEN as having a critical role in restaking and I'd like to try to break it down a little.\n\n# Staking Faults\n\nRestaking provides economic security to AVSs through the threat of slashing deposited collateral. If you (or more specifically, your delegated operator) follow the rules, you get paid. If you break the rules, you get slashed. But under the hood, slashing rules are encoded into smart contracts, and preferably the logic isn't just \"the AVS devs have complete power at any time to choose who to slash\". The contracts can be smarter than that.\n\n##### Objective Faults\n\nThe paper looks at two different categories of *faults*, the bad things that would trigger slashing. These are *objectively attributable* and *intersubjectively attributable* faults. Objective faults are the more straightforward of the two. This is where the contract can directly verify that the fault occurred. Think of double signing: the contract can easily check that yes, the same private key did sign two different conflicting messages, and therefore committed a fault. Fraud and validity proofs can also fall under this category: someone does something malicious, someone else creates a SNARK proving it was wrong, the contract verifies it, and slashing occurs.\n\nThese are not always easy or possible to implement for an AVS, but detection and resolution of these faults is straightforward. EigenLayer with restaked ETH is perfect for this.\n\n##### Intersubjective faults\n\nIntersubjective faults occur when there is a generally agreed upon truth but it is not mathematically provable on-chain. The standard example is price oracles. The contract doesn't know what's happening in the real world. We can all agree that the current market price of ETH is ~$3200, but the contract has to find some way to get a price feed from a source it can trust. Maybe that would be an AVS with a decentralized group of validators casting votes about the current price. The majority vote wins, so if the validator set is sufficiently decentralized, the correct price becomes a Schelling point.\n\nIf everyone says ETH market price is $3k but I cast a vote saying it's worth $10k, despite my number being much better, I'm not following the rules of the AVS. Anyone can look at actual market data and confirm that the price was actually $3k and that I'm in the wrong. But the contract itself can't objectively confirm that $3k is correct and $10k is wrong. So it's through agreement of the validator set, and my lone *dis*agreement, that determines that I have committed an *intersubjective fault*. Other potential sources of intersubjective faults include censorship resistance/detection, data availability, and as a stepping stone in verifiable computation before proving can be fully SNARKified.\n\n##### Tyranny of the Majority\n\nIdentifying intersubjective faults through majority votes works well... as long as the majority is honest and can all agree on the truth. There are a few ways this can break down. First is when a malicious attacker gains control of a majority of votes: they can trick the system into accepting an incorrect truth, and simultaneously slash any honest validators. Bribes make this possibility scarier. Second is when the truth itself is ambiguous, and honest voters may come to different conclusions. Maybe we're giving Ethereum an oracle price feed of another chain's native token, and that chain undergoes a contentious fork; which fork's token price do we follow?\n\nIn the end, with the intersubjective on-chain voting mechanism having broken down, the system has to fall back on *social consensus*, usually implemented through forking. If a malicious majority is saying the market price of ETH is $1, the rest of the world knows that's wrong, so we'll come to off-chain social consensus to make a fork. The old system is abandoned, and at the social layer everyone agrees to move to the new fork, which likely introduces socially-agreed-upon state changes to slash the attacker and \"unslash\" any honest validators caught up in the attack. A forkable oracle could also do just that to mirror a fork in the tracked token.\n\n##### Overloading Ethereum Consensus\n\nSo what happens in the case of EigenLayer when an attacker gains majority ETH control of an AVS with intersubjectively determined slashing conditions? We have *actual honest Ethereum validators* who could end up slashed and effectively (or literally, post-Pectra) booted from the Ethereum network. The social layer could come to the rescue again, but it would mean a hard fork of *Ethereum itself* to slash the malicious actors and restore the honest ones. \n\nVitalik wrote a well known blog post on this subject, referring to the issue as the [overloading of Ethereum consensus](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/05/21/dont_overload.html). One of the greatest risks is that we get a repeat of The DAO, where disagreement on if/how the social layer should resolve an application issue caused the Ethereum chain as a whole to fork. It's not too hard to imagine a situation where a large AVS gets intersubjectively attacked, an uncomfortable number of honest validators have their ETH slashed, and we once again have to decide between allowing some harm to the health of the network, or forking on behalf of a broken application. We really don't want to find ourselves in a position where we have to seriously have that debate again, and EigenLayer needs to be careful to not enable that.\n\n# The EIGEN Token\n\nThe paper talks about social consensus from the perspective that tokens/projects have certain social conditions agreed upon during their initial *setup phase* that determine how to resolve intersubjective faults later on. Bitcoin's community agreed on the longest chain rule for PoW consensus. Ethereum's community agreed on its fork choice rule as well, but with a stipulation that the goal would be to move to PoS, an important decision during the \"setup phase\" that eased the social acceptance of the transition. Rollups and national governments also follow this paradigm. EigenLayer's perspective is that allowing intersubjective restaking of ETH would be a violation of Ethereum's setup phase--citing the same Vitalik post. They argue that intersubjective restaking in general requires a very specific setup phase where the entire community engages with the token with a very specific set of expectations around its principles and intended use.\n\n**So the answer:** Design the EIGEN token specifically for the purpose of universal intersubjective staking. Design all AVSs so that all objective faults are backed by ETH, and all intersubjective faults are covered by EIGEN. In case of a failure of the intersubjective systems that requires social intervention and forking, that will be handled through the EIGEN token's *own forking system* rather than overloading Ethereum's social consensus.\n\n##### Two Token Model\n\nEigenLayer actually envisions a system that contains two tokens, EIGEN and bEIGEN. I'm not going to go into full detail about the tokens and forking behavior, but I can provide an overview, specifically of their V1 design. bEIGEN (b is for \"backing\") is what is used internally within EigenLayer; it is what is actually staked with an operator and may be forked into different versions over time to resolve issues at the social layer.

So you end up with the old pre-forked bEIGEN1 and new post-fork bEIGEN2. bEIGEN1 holders can claim their bEIGEN2 for a limited time.\n\nIn order to raise a challenge, the challenger must burn a significant amount of bEIGEN1--this is the cost to them if their challenge turns out to be incorrect and bEIGEN1 remains canonical. The challenger must also tag a sufficient amount of bEIGEN2 tokens as malicious, these will be burned in bEIGEN2, and punish the attacker if the challenger is correct and bEIGEN2 becomes canonical. Once both tokens exist, the social layer takes over and through market price discovery, adoption of the tokens by AVSs and other protocols, etc, decides which token is correct and canonical.\n\nThrough this method, the need for a social layer to intervene in some intersubjective faults can be realized. Ideally, AVSs are designed to minimize ambiguity about which fork would be correct if you just check the real-world source of truth. So in most cases it should be obvious. But it's probably unavoidable that some will be contentious, those will be more fun to watch play out and I'll be glad Ethereum validators aren't at risk.\n\nTechnical note: the reason why bEIGEN2 redemptions are limited-time is because it needs to be shorter than the withdrawal time in order to prevent an attacker from committing a fault, withdrawing, and claiming the bEIGEN2 tokens anyway. By having `t_redeem < t_withdraw`, the attacker has no way to get around their punishment. This carries the unfortunate design issue of putting a limit on redemption time. bEIGEN holders who delay may see all their value evaporate.\n\n##### EIGEN\n\nThe EIGEN token is designed to be insulated from all that, because imagine what a nightmare that would be for DeFi integrations. Anyone with bEIGEN can wrap it to become EIGEN. The EIGEN contract provides its own governance to follow the various forks of bEIGEN and swap its contents to reflect its view of the canonical bEIGEN token. When unwrapping, it will only ever return the bEIGENx it considers canonical, not any other others. In short, if you hold EIGEN, you are trusting its governance system to accurately follow the canonical fork and in exchange don't have to worry about the forks yourself. The obvious risk is that if governance is wrong or corrupt, you may end up holding junk.\n\n##### V2 Tokens\n\nThe big change in their proposed V2 is that the EIGEN contracts become immutable, and so must also be forked to create a EIGENx to match each bEIGENx. This creates a sort of historical record of the fork history through the various contracts, which gives EIGENx holders the option to hold passively and later claim all the bEIGEN tokens along the fork history, while protecting them from malicious EIGEN governance.\n\nThis seems to hurt the DeFi usage of the token, as each EIGENx will remain its own tradeable token. I think only the most recent EIGENx will be used, as it's the only one that could be actively wrapped from bEIGENx, so that would mean DeFi protocols would have to add each new EIGENx as they come out. But it's still much more convenient than using bEIGEN in DeFi. At least with EIGEN there's no pressure to redeem forks immediately; with bEIGEN if you don't manage to untangle it from nested DeFi positions and redeem forks in time you're screwed.\n\n# Conclusion and Thoughts\n\nThe big thing here is that ETH restaking will only be used as economic security for objective faults, while (b)EIGEN provides economic security for intersubjective faults. Intersubjective faults often require social consensus to resolve through a fork (e.g. The DAO) and can sometimes be contentious. So the biggest benefit of this system is that the Ethereum social consensus layer is not pressured to fork the chain in order to resolve issues with an AVS. Without this there's a really good chance that a too-big-to-fail AVS would eventually get attacked and Ethereum would face a difficult decision about whether to fork to protect the honest stakers caught up in the incident, possibly bad enough to create an Ethereum Classic 2.0.\n\n##### What is EigenLayer Actually?\n\nThe biggest downside to me is the breakdown of EigenLayer as an ETH **RE**staking platform. Anyone can deploy a smart contract through which you can stake an ERC20 token as collateral and earn rewards for computational services while taking on slashing risk in case of misbehavior. A general marketplace for buying and selling economic security, kinda neat.\n\nEigenLayer is particularly interesting in that it uses ETH (which is possibly the world's best collateral asset), and all of the ETH it has access to for security is also actively involved in regular ETH validator duties. For me it feels like there's a fundamental difference there. That having your AVS's economic security come from the same ETH that's securing the network feels like you're sharing in that same security, like you're tapping into a particularly valuable, established set of actors. Ethereum validators are already committed to locking up their ETH to earn rewards, if EigenLayer makes it easy to access the same set of actors, you know you're  able to easily source high quality economic security for any project that's willing to pay for it, rather than bootstrapping a validator set from scratch.\n\nEIGEN isn't \"restaking\", it's just... staking. To be fair, it's a token designed to be the best universal intersubjective staking token, allows delegators to provide security to numerous shifting AVSs simultaneously, and will have tooling around it to make it easy for AVSs to adopt. So it's the basis for a nice market for economic security for anyone who wants to buy or sell it. But in my mind it loses that critical edge that ETH has.\n\nIf EigenLayer dropped ETH altogether and EIGEN were used as the sole medium of exchange for economic security in their marketplace, I feel like I'd hesitate to use it. Wouldn't you? To some extent I feel like EigenLayer gained a lot of prominence specifically because of the ETH restaking direction, and it's a bit of a light rugpull to say \"now that you've gotten on board, you have to buy our token in order to use half of our system\". Maybe it helps that the airdrop goes in part to ETH stakers who followed the incentives, making it easier for them to participate in both aspects? And maybe this is a necessary tradeoff to avoid overloading Ethereum consensus; there's no other way?\n\n##### Other Thoughts\n\nRegardless of the above, I think it's clear that EIGEN as a staking token is a riskier play for EigenLayer than ETH restaking. It means a notable increase in complexity and risk factors. The system described in the paper is in no way simple to design or implement. And this token's close integration with critical staking systems means Ethereum as a whole has more risk exposure to Eigen Labs. Should we be putting more work into protocolizing EigenLayer in the same way that we're working towards ePBS? In taking this step, EL further invite this discussion.\n\nI have been a little frustrated with the rough state of AVSs at this point in EigenLayer's launch, and how few of them have really described what slashing is going to look like (despite them being literally live on mainnet!). This announcement does explain it somewhat: AVSs are going to have to factor EIGEN and intersubjective faults into their designs, so it would have been unfair to expect them to develop their slashing mechanisms before this was described in detail. So cool, maybe they can work on their economics now finally. But at the same time... why the heck did EigenLayer deploy to *mainnet* before this info was released? Why?\n\nI haven't really done a deep dive on the theory of forking tokens, so I can't really analyze that too deeply. But I have always thought it's a cool idea, and enjoy reading about governance systems designed with forking as a central concept, e.g. The DAO, Nouns DAO. The paper draws comparisons to Augur's REP token but doesn't list others that really fork an application's utility token. So this may actually be pretty novel, EigenLayer is huge and their forking system is very likely to be stress tested by malicious actors. I'm very curious to see how it plays out.\n\n##### ty\n\nAnd I guess that's that. The paper is 43 pages, so I guess I shouldn't feel too bad that this ended up so long.
