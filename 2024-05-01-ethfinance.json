Using fresh wallet they can do the Pendle YT play and to others it will be seen as a great trade (Wow, this wallet 0x54.... made $25k from $3k, great trader) but the guy clueless with no insider information loses hard. Example, if you look at the Renzo ezETH YT price, it started crashing hard few days before the airdrop announcement. Obviously the insiders with the information were exiting before the info was public. A person entering there has lost heavily, a sheep....  \n\nSimilarly, Eigen insider who knew about 15th March snapshot will have exploited it easily, almost impossible to even detect this now. Some of the Pendle pools were just barely just went live then, and they could have entered at very low yield, and exited at 70% yield.
