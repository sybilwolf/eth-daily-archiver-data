This could be a DAO treasury, a L2 with bridged ETH that they would like to generate yield on, or a DeFi protocol that wants their own vault and bespoke LST to onboard onto their platform. We&#39;re piloting this concept with the Gravita, who will be announcing more details in the weeks ahead, but the TLDR is that by minting gravETH from the Gravita x NodeSet vault, you&#39;ll enjoy preferential lending terms vs. traditional LST collateral assets. If you&#39;re a node operator interested in participating and receiving delegations from the vault, check out the Beta announcement here and sign up!   </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NodeOperators/status/1786522677630439442\">https://twitter.com/NodeOperators/status/1786522677630439442</a>   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Constellation</strong>: a &quot;Layer 2&quot; protocol built on Rocket Pool designed to help it scale. Over the last year, RP has been limited by the NO bond side. Constellation allows users to mint two new LSTs (xrETH and xRPL) to fund the ETH and RPL side of the NO bond and non-custodially distributes those assets to NodeSet operators, enabling them to spin up more validators and service rETH demand. The system distributes ETH in an egalitarian fashion, ensuring thin distribution of assets over as large an operator base as possible and strengthening the long-tail of operators to maximize decentralization.   </p>\n\n<p>Long-term, we&#39;re building a platform that connects independent node operators with all kinds of opportunities in Web3 while abstracting node operator management away from developers. We have plans to to integrate with many projects in the space, so stay tuned and sign up above!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-03 15:43:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l2gq70g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cj0i2a","parent_id":"t1_l2dt4qq","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"I'd say it's not textbook restaking at all..
