I have been away for a long time. I'm currently unwell and do not have the energy to try to get up to date, I barely understood how POW worked.\n\nWhatever Ethereum is today, does it still have promise of building a new financial ecosystem and being the backbone of finance? Mass adoption will come if the correct/needed applications are being built.\n\nBut at a quick glance the space seems to be slightly empty, and all I see are airdrops and yield farming, when Ethereum and in general crypto has (had?) the potential to create a real revolution and change humanity.\n\nCan someone direct me to good sources of information I could read or watch to catch up with what has been happening since 2021? As I said, I'm very unwell and do not have the mental sharpness or strength to go in depth right now...even if I want to.\n\nEver since August 2015 I've been following the ETHBTC ratio, and although I'm not worried, I am starting to think perhaps my timeline for seeing a ratio bull market is farther away than I had hoped...perhaps this still needs a few years. Or perhaps this is a retest of the ratio breakout from 2021 before moving higher.\n\nBut we need a catalyst, and airdrops along with yield farming won't cut it. Ethereum needs to prove that a new financial system is on the way before a bubble similar to the dot com bubble is possible. Perhaps that's here, hence I'm asking for information to help me build an objective narrative.
