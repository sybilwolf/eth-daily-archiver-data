Basically laughing 4 hours straight. Enjoying good food, drinks and a great time discussing everything... but crypto. (You can find evidence of this in /food on farcaster)</p>\n\n<p>Touch some grass/ steak. Enjoy time with your friends. Ethereum is and will be an important ecosystem, but since it&#39;s decentralized it will flourish even if you don&#39;t actively think about for some hours. Have fun. Go out. Meet friends. Have some drinks. Grab some good food. Especially if the price action of the past couple of weeks made you uncomfortable. </p>\n\n<p>We will go up (#nfa) again, but only if your cool as a green cucumber.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-08 14:51:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l370kp9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cmwhiy","parent_id":"t3_1cmwhiy","score":31,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/15kisFUD","body":"Thanks Bearnido!
