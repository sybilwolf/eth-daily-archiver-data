I was a few desks away from a healthy 30 year old with no previous known conditions when he let out a loud groan and collapsed on the floor from his desk chair before violently convulsing. Almost everyone stood there in shock. His friend tried to catch him as he fell but beyond that they were a bit unsure on what to do. Initially I was feeling the same way and knowing that I haven\u2019t done first aid training or anything I was hoping someone nearby had and would spring into action. But nobody did, so after a few seconds I ran over, protected his head so he didn\u2019t hit it on anything and then rolled him into the recovery position as he was foaming at the mouth, allowing him to keep breathing. I yelled out to ask if anyone knew first aid but nobody came forward so I asked for someone to go to the reception to get someone with some expertise. Some other smart folks started to call an ambulance. After a minute or so he started to chill out a bit with the convulsions but was still unresponsive and breathing heavily. 10 minutes later he began to regain consciousness and not much later the paramedics arrived and started running tests before taking him to the hospital.\n\nThankfully all seems well but two things really stuck with me from this.\n\n- Most people (myself included at first) are just in shock in situations like this. Only natural leaders or trained professionals will kick into action right away. But even if you\u2019ve done one first aid training course or know some absolute basics like the recovery position and when to and when not to perform CPR (and how to) then you\u2019re probably well ahead of the curve. So don\u2019t be scared to be the leader in these situations. There was a noticeable shift in people jumping into action once the ice was broken and we started communicating with each other. Suddenly people started clearing the area and calling emergency services. Depending on the type of emergency, the first minute of your response can save someone\u2019s life, so you getting up and being a leader could literally save someone\u2019s life. My only caveat would be to know your own limits too. Stick to what you know you should do. The reality of first aid is that most of the time you\u2019re not doing much while you wait for professionals to arrive, so don\u2019t go moving someone with a spinal injury or removing objects from wounds!\n- This could happen to anyone. At any time. This man was fit and healthy and had no prior known conditions. Imagine if this happened while he was behind the wheel of a car (easily a possible death sentence) or if he was alone in the library working late. He could\u2019ve caused serious damage while convulsing or drowned in his own saliva or vomit. Life is short and we could be gone at any moment. Today was a surreal reminder of that fact for me and it leaves you feeling a lot less bothered about the trivial things like politics, race and creed. How many people would you actively not help in such a situation just because they hold certain beliefs or belong to a certain race? I think for most people the answer would be that you\u2019d help almost everyone.\n\nAlso, while this didn\u2019t come in useful this time, please set up a medical ID on your phone. Especially if you have any allergies or are on any medications. While this is only really a native iPhone feature, you should still know that if the patient has an iPhone, pressing the lock button 5 times in quick succession will activate the emergency menu where you can see their medical ID with any important info a bit like a digital Medic Alert bracelet. Furthermore, the same will also allow you to use their phone to make an emergency call without unlocking their phone if you don\u2019t have access to your own phone.

I was a few desks away from a healthy 30 year old with no previous known conditions when he let out a loud groan and collapsed on the floor from his desk chair before violently convulsing. Almost everyone stood there in shock. His friend tried to catch him as he fell but beyond that they were a bit unsure on what to do. Initially I was feeling the same way and knowing that I haven\u2019t done first aid training or anything I was hoping someone nearby had and would spring into action. But nobody did, so after a few seconds I ran over, protected his head so he didn\u2019t hit it on anything and then rolled him into the recovery position as he was foaming at the mouth, allowing him to keep breathing. I yelled out to ask if anyone knew first aid but nobody came forward so I asked for someone to go to the reception to get someone with some expertise. Some other smart folks started to call an ambulance. After a minute or so he started to chill out a bit with the convulsions but was still unresponsive and breathing heavily. 10 minutes later he began to regain consciousness and not much later the paramedics arrived and started running tests before taking him to the hospital.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully all seems well but two things really stuck with me from this.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most people (myself included at first) are just in shock in situations like this. Only natural leaders or trained professionals will kick into action right away. But even if you\u2019ve done one first aid training course or know some absolute basics like the recovery position and when to and when not to perform CPR (and how to) then you\u2019re probably well ahead of the curve. So don\u2019t be scared to be the leader in these situations. There was a noticeable shift in people jumping into action once the ice was broken and we started communicating with each other. Suddenly people started clearing the area and calling emergency services. Depending on the type of emergency, the first minute of your response can save someone\u2019s life, so you getting up and being a leader could literally save someone\u2019s life. My only caveat would be to know your own limits too. Stick to what you know you should do. The reality of first aid is that most of the time you\u2019re not doing much while you wait for professionals to arrive, so don\u2019t go moving someone with a spinal injury or removing objects from wounds!</li>\n<li>This could happen to anyone. At any time. This man was fit and healthy and had no prior known conditions. Imagine if this happened while he was behind the wheel of a car (easily a possible death sentence) or if he was alone in the library working late. He could\u2019ve caused serious damage while convulsing or drowned in his own saliva or vomit. Life is short and we could be gone at any moment. Today was a surreal reminder of that fact for me and it leaves you feeling a lot less bothered about the trivial things like politics, race and creed. How many people would you actively not help in such a situation just because they hold certain beliefs or belong to a certain race? I think for most people the answer would be that you\u2019d help almost everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, while this didn\u2019t come in useful this time, please set up a medical ID on your phone. Especially if you have any allergies or are on any medications. While this is only really a native iPhone feature, you should still know that if the patient has an iPhone, pressing the lock button 5 times in quick succession will activate the emergency menu where you can see their medical ID with any important info a bit like a digital Medic Alert bracelet.
