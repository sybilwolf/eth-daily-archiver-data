Better check it out&quot;</p>\n\n<p>[NOTE: the final tweet was of course from a phishing account but I only noticed when I checked later - the language, wording, PFP etc, were all perfect except for a one-character difference in the username]</p>\n\n<p>So I click over to the [FAKE - DO NOT CLICK - &quot;Reya Labs&quot; site]. </p>\n\n<p>Cognitive Dissonance 1: I remember thinking &quot;Huh? Reya Labs? I thought their site was Reya Network?&quot; - but I <em>did nothing</em> and went ahead</p>\n\n<p>Cognitive Dissoance 2: The site <em>looked</em> like the real site, but it said the current &quot;boost&quot; for early depositors was 5x - but the actual boost is 2.5x I think and has not been 5x for weeks - again, I noticed but thought &quot;oh well, maybe if you do some social media tasks they will bump it up to 5x&quot; - that does actually happen on the real site so it was a reasonable thought. </p>\n\n<p>Cognitive Dissonance 3: There was some text, but not a lot of explanation - just something about &quot;connect wallet to find out rank&quot; - again, this is fairly normal so I did connect my wallet</p>\n\n<p>Cognitive Dissonance 4: It auto-switched me to Blast on Metamask and for the first time I was like &quot;What? This is a new independent L2 and anyway it hasn&#39;t fully launched yet - why is it switching me to Blast? What&#39;s the connection?&quot; But I still allowed it - we&#39;re still running on autopilot at this point. </p>\n\n<p>Cognitive Dissonance 5: I <em>hate</em> it when dApps force you to sign a transaction just to sign in - it&#39;s understandable when you want to <em>do</em> something but it annoys me when it is necessary to just view your dashboard or rank - but again, it is unfortunately common, so I wasn&#39;t surprised when the popup came up and asked me to sign - but then I noticed that the text wasn&#39;t the usual English text string you see in this kind of thing but some very long string of numbers and <em>finally</em> got a bit suspicious and thought &quot;I&#39;m not signing something I don&#39;t understand especially just to see the Leaderboard and hit &quot;Reject&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Cognitive Dissonance 6: As soon as I hit &quot;Reject&quot;, the popup just came up again with the same transaction to sign, which is behaviour I have never seen before - to keep the popup repeating without me triggering it again, and I actually thought about it for a second, but by this point it had hit my conscious mind that something was &quot;off&quot; and I slowed down, and then the whole thing fell apart of course (with a sigh of relief about how close a call it had been - I&#39;m farming Blast and had quite a lot of personal funds there and the signature may have been useable on L1 mainnet too). </p>\n\n<p>But the psychology was really interesting to kind of think about how someone  like me who should know a lot better can still get taken in and the brain smooths over all the cognitive dissonance &quot;warning&quot; moments until they piled up enough that I was forced to acknowledge it..</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-13 04:56:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l3u6uch","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cqr9e8","parent_id":"t3_1cqr9e8","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProfStrangelove","body":"Twitter is pure cancer regarding scam links...

Policy is unavoidable. Politics is. See the difference? Please feel free to discuss policy as it pertains to crypto. Relevant sources, articles, videos etc will not be removed. Politics, on the other hand, is not what this sub is for. Comments that deviate into politics, grandstanding (including excessive/repeat posting), or poking at other users will be removed. Use common sense and aim for constructive conversation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-13 20:00:03","distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"id":"l3y78r5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cqr9e8","parent_id":"t1_l3y4k6x","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Ok-Nectarine-6654","body":"Study May 20th.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Study May 20th.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-13 16:21:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l3xasnk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cqr9e8","parent_id":"t3_1cqr9e8","score":-8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Ok-Nectarine-6654","body":"Study May 27","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Study May 27</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-13 20:08:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l3y8etf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cqr9e8","parent_id":"t3_1cqr9e8","score":-11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Ok-Nectarine-6654","body":"Somebody got hurt badly\u00a0","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Somebody got hurt badly\u00a0</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-13 20:40:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l3ycgv7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cqr9e8","parent_id":"t1_l3y8etf","score":-3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}}}
