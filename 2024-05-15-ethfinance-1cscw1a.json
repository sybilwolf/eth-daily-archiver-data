has [mentioned sharding yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1crk4ou/daily_general_discussion_may_14_2024/l40rkhp/) and when it will come. Sharding as a scaling solution been discarded at least 3 years ago. I first wanted to write a short reply but it got longer so I post it here. \n\nSharding was the idea, that the Ethereum chain will be split up into different shards with each shard being able execute transactions. The core of the idea was that nodes would only have to validate a subset of all the shards leading to an increase in throughput without pushing home stakers out of the network by increasing resource demand. The problem in this approach is that shards cannot easily communicate with each other which complicates transactions as one would have to make additional transactions to move from one shard to another. Overall it became a rather complex solution. \n\nWith the advent of rollups, people found that this allows for an easier and even more scalable solution. So in about 2021 the original sharding concept was abandoned and scaling through L2s is now considered the way to go. In my understanding there still is the concept of shards, but they were renamed to blobs and they cannot execute transactions. So the nodes do not have to run and validate the transactions which are stored in blobs. Rollups do this. \n\nWith the dencun upgrade we got the first iteration of this scaling plan with EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding). This allowed scaling of the Ethereum ecosystem by about a factor of 50 to 100. Currently the rollups do around 10 times as many transactions than Ethereum does, so they still have room to grow. At the moment, we allow to have 3 blobs per block on average for rollup transaction data, which seems to be like a good value. It increases the load on nodes, but not so much to compromise decentralization. I guess there will be more analysis done in the coming months to see if we can increase the number of blobs a bit. \n\nThe next step in the L2 scaling roadmap is danksharding, which will allow nodes to only store a subset of blobs for a limited time but still make sure that all the data has been published by the rollups using data availability sampling. This will increase the available blob space by at least another factor of 20 without increasing the load on nodes by the same amount. The details of this upgrade is very much being worked on and as far as I understand peerDAS (EIP-7594) is currently the best proposal to achieve that goal. Not sure if peerDAS is already the end goal or just a minimal implementation of data availability sampling.\n\nI am not sure when this is planned to be implemented, but if it will not come in the next Ethereum upgrade. But maybe in the one after that. The good thing is that going from proto danksharding to full danksharding does mostly (or even only) involve changes in the consensus layer, which means there is less coordination necessary between the different teams. \n\nIn addition there will be improvements of the Execution layer as well (like verkle trees, statelessness, history expiry and snarkifying the base chain). Those improvements will allow to increase transaction throughput on mainnet while keeping the resource demand for node operators in check. None of these will 100x increase throughput over night, but together they will massively scale Ethereum in the coming years.

So I'm just steelmaning your argument. \n\nAt the end of the day the reason why you want execution sharding is to parallelize execution, so you can actually scale. If every node needs to compute the same state transitions, the same computation, it's obvious that you cannot scale in any real manner. The system is as slow as the slowest node. Which means you need to keep increasing the minimal requirements to increase your throughput, which leads to centralization and you are trapped by the blockchain scalability trilemma. In other words, increasing the minimal requirements of a node, does not solve scalability at all. In the same way that telling your employees to work twice harder does not solve your production scalability. Solving scalability requires architectural changes that allow you to parallelize what you are doing.\n\nThe roll-up roadmap enables this parallelization. Because the state transitions of a roll-up are only computed by that roll-up, no one else needs to do so. The network only has to verify a proof, which is much simpler computationally. So you gain effectively parallelization, every roll-up parallelizes execution, which is the main property you want to gain from execution sharding.\n\nAnd with PeerDAS and full dank-sharding we will then gain data sharding. So the full dank-sharding roadmap meets the 2 basic properties we wanted to achieve of sharding (sharded execution and sharded data). So, in my opinion, sharding is still very much on the table.
