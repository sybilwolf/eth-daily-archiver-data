Which is sad, because Ethereum is way, way better in virtually every measure against any alt L1 smart contract chain out there. The cloud of regulatory uncertainty can really dampen performance for years on end. I hope it gets resolved soon, but these things take years to play out. </p>\n\n<p>ETF and security talk aside, you also have (imo) the BIG elephant in the room, which is the declining ratio for years on end, essentially since 2017 (and an even stronger downtrend since EOY 2021). This begs lots of questions:</p>\n\n<p>-Will we ever see a new ATH again for ratio? </p>\n\n<p>-What is the actual fair value of ETH when measured against BTC? .03? .02? Lower? Early 2017 the ratio was sub .01! No one really knows, but it is disconcerting when slowly bleed through supposedly key &quot;support&quot; levels. People see other coins shoot up, and meanwhile ETH bleeds out or barely stays afloat. If you think it&#39;s bad now, just imagine what it could be like if BTC continues marching to $100k, and we simply stay here at $3k or $3.5k or $4k. I don&#39;t think that will happen, but it isn&#39;t out of the cards at all. </p>\n\n<p>On the bright side, I think we have a TON of people on our side that are fighting for clear regulatory approval. I think we have a TON of brilliant minds and coders working to make Ethereum better and building tons of new applications and uses. It&#39;s just a matter of time before activity and usage starts to pick up again.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-16 06:58:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l4b2jjo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ct57il","parent_id":"t1_l4aolfh","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/thenamelessone7","body":"I don't think we will ever see another ratio ATH, because in June 2017 it was literally a smidge from flipping BTC.\n\nI don't really see that happening in the next 10 years, or ever.

I guess it's just a rather broad definition of MEV that I am using. \n\nSo how does Base (but basically most EVM equivalent L2s) work? As far as I understand it, all L2s use the same or a very similar fee market like L1 does. I think there are nuances with regards to how gas is calculated (cause afaik in zkEVMs the execution cost of a similar transaction are different based on how the EVM was implemented), but the fee market is the same. There is a block with X of gas. If a lot of users want to transact, then the fee goes up like we know it from 1559. If you look at different L2 explorers, you will notice that the gas price in gwei keeps moving. \n\nBut what does that mean? That means that sometimes users will send a tx and it won't make it into the next block because the previous block was full and gas was automatically raised (or the wallet somehow miscalculated the correct fee and underpaid). I haven't seen this on Base, cause I basically bridged to Base for the first time like 2 days ago, but I have had some L2 tx stuck because of low gas in the past and had to manually raise the gas to include the transaction in the wallet. \n\nThis means that there is a logic that basically says \"pay a higher fee and you will be included\" similar to the priority gas auctions we had on mainnet pre 1559. This is MEV in a broad sense cause it will be captured by the \"miner\" = sequencer. On L2 this really happens cause L2s don't burn tx fees at all. So for an L2 higher fees mean higher revenue and profits, while validators on L1 don't directly profit from higher fees.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am not saying they are front running, no. I guess it&#39;s just a rather broad definition of MEV that I am using. </p>\n\n<p>So how does Base (but basically most EVM equivalent L2s) work? As far as I understand it, all L2s use the same or a very similar fee market like L1 does. I think there are nuances with regards to how gas is calculated (cause afaik in zkEVMs the execution cost of a similar transaction are different based on how the EVM was implemented), but the fee market is the same. There is a block with X of gas. If a lot of users want to transact, then the fee goes up like we know it from 1559. If you look at different L2 explorers, you will notice that the gas price in gwei keeps moving. </p>\n\n<p>But what does that mean? That means that sometimes users will send a tx and it won&#39;t make it into the next block because the previous block was full and gas was automatically raised (or the wallet somehow miscalculated the correct fee and underpaid). I haven&#39;t seen this on Base, cause I basically bridged to Base for the first time like 2 days ago, but I have had some L2 tx stuck because of low gas in the past and had to manually raise the gas to include the transaction in the wallet. </p>\n\n<p>This means that there is a logic that basically says &quot;pay a higher fee and you will be included&quot; similar to the priority gas auctions we had on mainnet pre 1559. This is MEV in a broad sense cause it will be captured by the &quot;miner&quot; = sequencer. On L2 this really happens cause L2s don&#39;t burn tx fees at all. So for an L2 higher fees mean higher revenue and profits, while validators on L1 don&#39;t directly profit from higher fees.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-17 00:55:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l4fcd51","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ct57il","parent_id":"t1_l4d0vdz","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"I'm not sure, it's different on different rollups and it changed a bit after blobs.
