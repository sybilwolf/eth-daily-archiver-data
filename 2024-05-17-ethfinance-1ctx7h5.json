It is not yet clear whether the appeal has been approved, but the good news is, according to some sources Alexey is free on bail for the time being.\n\nSince I'm not a lawyer I didn't feel qualified to objectively judge the court's verdict, I like to leave these things to subject matter experts. Thankfully, today a local Dutch law firm published [an article (in English!)](https://hertoghsadvocaten.nl/en/kennisbank/tornado-cash-the-developer-as-co-perpetrator-of-money-laundering/) analysing the verdict and concluding: \"From my perspective, the judgment fails to address these questions adequately, indicating that it is ripe for appeal.\"\n\nHere's what I found most interesting:\n\n> **The role of Pertsev in Tornado Cash**\n\n> The court asserts that Pertsev, alongside co-suspects Roman Storm and Roman Semenov\u2014who are under prosecution in the US\u2014are the creators of Tornado Cash. They engineered the system to function autonomously and immutably. Since the system\u2019s basic operations were unalterable from the outset, the court holds these individuals are and remain accountable for its functionality.\n\n> In December 2020, the governance of Tornado Cash was transferred to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), meaning its governance structure was by then overseen by the community. However, the court concludes that the foundational operations of the system were unchangeable and, therefore, the original setup by the founders remains a critical factor.\n\n> **Co-perpetration Concerns**\n\n> The court\u2019s reasoning on co-perpetration seems flawed to me. It suggests that Tornado Cash, let\u2019s call it a digital platform or system, independently enacted the acts of hiding and concealing cryptocurrency with a criminal origin. This implies that a system can engage in criminal behaviour on its own\u2014an unusual and potentially problematic interpretation, as it shifts the criminal conduct itself from individuals to systems. [...] This could have significant implications for software developers if tools are perceived as independently capable of criminal actions, making the developers responsible for the tool\u2019s \u2018actions\u2019.\n\n> **Questioning criminal intent**\n\n> Another aspect open to criticism is how the court motivates Pertsev\u2019s criminal intent. [...] The court\u2019s assumption that the general knowledge that mixers could be used for criminal activities was enough to establish Pertsev\u2019s intent for these specific transactions is questionable.\n\n> The court argues it is common knowledge that mixers are used by criminals, citing a report by the Financial Action Task Force and the classification by the Financial Intelligence Unit in The Netherlands dated August 15, 2017, that the use of a mixer is a money laundering typology. [...] Does foreseeing that your software might be used by criminals make you criminal liable for their actions? And what did Pertsev know at that moment in time, as the assumed common knowledge in 2019 is highly debatable? The case file might indicate Pertsev was aware of criminal usage of Tornado Cash at some point, but this does not necessarily relate to his actions at the time he set up the system or to the timing of the specific transactions.\n\n> I believe the judgment for Pertsev\u2019s criminal intent was poorly motivated, and the legal intricacies remain underexplored.
