Those transactions are submited to many places, but commonly the public mempool that is maintained by all the Ethereum nodes. Validators propose new blocks to add to the blockchain, and they are the party that gets to decide which transactions, and in which order, those new blocks contain. If they do this themself, it is called \"local block building\"; but in practice, most validators use a piece of software called MEV-Boost (more on why it's called that shortly) to receive built blocks from external builders, who pay the validator for the privilege of selecting the block's contents. Those blocks are passed to the validator via a \"neutral\" third party called a relay.\n\nNow, many of those user transactions \"leave money on the table\" in one form or another, and clever third parties can take that money, which we call MEV, for themselves. They usually do that with the use of bots.\n\nA common (and relevant here) example of MEV would be sandwiching, in which a user submits a transaction for a dex trade, but with a relatively large slippage set, which means that the market can move by that percentage from where the user saw it, and the trade is still valid. A MEV bot that is able to see that transaction before it goes through (which is easy if it was submitted to the public mempool) can come along and frontrun/backrun the transaction, by taking a large amount of money (often VERY large) and making their own trade on the dex, moving the price in a direction disadvantageous to the victim, then letting the victim's trade go through (losing some money due to slippage), and then going back in with the backrun tx and recovering all their starting money, plus some extra that came from the victim's slippage.\n\nIt is of extreme importance (for the MEVer) that that sequence of three transactions (frontrun, victim trade, backrun) happen in exactly that order, without any other transactions in between, because potentially those other transactions might also trade on the same dex, and might do the \"wrong\" thing versus what the MEVer wanted, i.e. trading in the opposite direction from the victim transaction, which would result in the MEVer losing money instead of the victim. So these transactions are submitted in \"bundles\" by the MEV bot to the external block builder; the block builder promises to keep those bundles in exactly that order and without anything in between. That allows the MEV exploit to successfully take the money the victim transaction \"left on the table\". It is essential that the MEVer can trust the builder to leave their bundles alone.\n\nAn excellent question at this juncture: the validator has to sign off on blocks that they submit. Why couldn't the validator see all of the transactions in the block and mess with the MEV transactions themself? The answer is that MEV-Boost is designed such that the relay just passes the validator the *header* of the block, which is the thing that needs signing. The validator has no idea what's in the block, or if it is even valid, when they sign it. This is a fairly trusting thing to do, but the ecosystem has accepted it. Back in 2023, as soon as the validator signed the header, the relay would send the rest of the contents of the block to the validator (who could now see the MEV transactions, but has already signed that version of the block, and so cannot change the block, at risk of getting slashed), and the validator would broadcast the block body to the network, and everything is hunky dory.\n\nSo that's all necessary context for what happened. These smart brothers from MIT realized that in some cases, it's actually worth it to get slashed. They set up their own validators, got some bot code ready to go, and waited.\n\nWhen it was their turn to propose a block, they received the block header from the relay via MEV-Boost, signed it and sent it back, and were sent the block body (with all the transactions) like usual. But instead of broadcasting that block, they looked at the transactions, and saw that there were some juicy MEV sandwiches going on inside there. (In fact, they had made sure of that, by putting their own 'victim' transactions into the public mempool to bait the sandwich bot, once they knew they were going to be proposing.) And their bot unbundled those MEV sandwiches and did the thing the MEVers assumed no one could do: they inserted their own dex transaction in between the sandwich frontrun and backrun, going the \"wrong way\". They did this in such a way that essentially all of the sandwich bot's money, which again can be a LARGE amount, and in this case was around $25M, was eaten up by their inserted transaction. Basically the MEVer got MEV'd.\n\nAfter *very quickly* doing all this, they took their modified block, signed *that* block, and broadcast it to the network as quickly as possible. Now there were two versions of the block floating around, one the original that they had to sign in order to see the block transactions, and one the modified version that they also had to sign. The modified block won (they made sure of this via another clever trick outside the scope of this post). Of course, signing two blocks is grounds for getting slashed on Ethereum, and their validator did indeed get slashed, losing the usual 1 Eth. \n\nBut the brothers were able to take $25M of the MEVers' money, which they thought was completely safe, but due to this loophole in the way MEV-Boost worked, was actually not. (The loophole was subsequently patched by having the relay broadcast the signed block body to the network for several seconds before sending it back to the validator, so the validator doesn't have a chance of getting their own version of the block accepted).\n\nWas this a crime? I honestly don't know haha. A lot of us were cheering for them at the time, because it was a case of one of the Dark Forest inhabitants who regularly preys on normal users, getting eaten by an even bigger and darker denizen of the Forest.

It will be a fascinating case from the \"code is law\" perspective - the MEV people will have to argue that this was a crime without also implicating their own entire business model in equivalent crimes haha.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So Ethereum processes lots of user transactions. Those transactions are submited to many places, but commonly the public mempool that is maintained by all the Ethereum nodes. Validators propose new blocks to add to the blockchain, and they are the party that gets to decide which transactions, and in which order, those new blocks contain. If they do this themself, it is called &quot;local block building&quot;; but in practice, most validators use a piece of software called MEV-Boost (more on why it&#39;s called that shortly) to receive built blocks from external builders, who pay the validator for the privilege of selecting the block&#39;s contents. Those blocks are passed to the validator via a &quot;neutral&quot; third party called a relay.</p>\n\n<p>Now, many of those user transactions &quot;leave money on the table&quot; in one form or another, and clever third parties can take that money, which we call MEV, for themselves. They usually do that with the use of bots.</p>\n\n<p>A common (and relevant here) example of MEV would be sandwiching, in which a user submits a transaction for a dex trade, but with a relatively large slippage set, which means that the market can move by that percentage from where the user saw it, and the trade is still valid. A MEV bot that is able to see that transaction before it goes through (which is easy if it was submitted to the public mempool) can come along and frontrun/backrun the transaction, by taking a large amount of money (often VERY large) and making their own trade on the dex, moving the price in a direction disadvantageous to the victim, then letting the victim&#39;s trade go through (losing some money due to slippage), and then going back in with the backrun tx and recovering all their starting money, plus some extra that came from the victim&#39;s slippage.</p>\n\n<p>It is of extreme importance (for the MEVer) that that sequence of three transactions (frontrun, victim trade, backrun) happen in exactly that order, without any other transactions in between, because potentially those other transactions might also trade on the same dex, and might do the &quot;wrong&quot; thing versus what the MEVer wanted, i.e. trading in the opposite direction from the victim transaction, which would result in the MEVer losing money instead of the victim. So these transactions are submitted in &quot;bundles&quot; by the MEV bot to the external block builder; the block builder promises to keep those bundles in exactly that order and without anything in between. That allows the MEV exploit to successfully take the money the victim transaction &quot;left on the table&quot;. It is essential that the MEVer can trust the builder to leave their bundles alone.</p>\n\n<p>An excellent question at this juncture: the validator has to sign off on blocks that they submit. Why couldn&#39;t the validator see all of the transactions in the block and mess with the MEV transactions themself? The answer is that MEV-Boost is designed such that the relay just passes the validator the <em>header</em> of the block, which is the thing that needs signing. The validator has no idea what&#39;s in the block, or if it is even valid, when they sign it. This is a fairly trusting thing to do, but the ecosystem has accepted it. Back in 2023, as soon as the validator signed the header, the relay would send the rest of the contents of the block to the validator (who could now see the MEV transactions, but has already signed that version of the block, and so cannot change the block, at risk of getting slashed), and the validator would broadcast the block body to the network, and everything is hunky dory.</p>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s all necessary context for what happened. These smart brothers from MIT realized that in some cases, it&#39;s actually worth it to get slashed. They set up their own validators, got some bot code ready to go, and waited.</p>\n\n<p>When it was their turn to propose a block, they received the block header from the relay via MEV-Boost, signed it and sent it back, and were sent the block body (with all the transactions) like usual. But instead of broadcasting that block, they looked at the transactions, and saw that there were some juicy MEV sandwiches going on inside there. (In fact, they had made sure of that, by putting their own &#39;victim&#39; transactions into the public mempool to bait the sandwich bot, once they knew they were going to be proposing.) And their bot unbundled those MEV sandwiches and did the thing the MEVers assumed no one could do: they inserted their own dex transaction in between the sandwich frontrun and backrun, going the &quot;wrong way&quot;. They did this in such a way that essentially all of the sandwich bot&#39;s money, which again can be a LARGE amount, and in this case was around $25M, was eaten up by their inserted transaction. Basically the MEVer got MEV&#39;d.</p>\n\n<p>After <em>very quickly</em> doing all this, they took their modified block, signed <em>that</em> block, and broadcast it to the network as quickly as possible. Now there were two versions of the block floating around, one the original that they had to sign in order to see the block transactions, and one the modified version that they also had to sign. The modified block won (they made sure of this via another clever trick outside the scope of this post). Of course, signing two blocks is grounds for getting slashed on Ethereum, and their validator did indeed get slashed, losing the usual 1 Eth. </p>\n\n<p>But the brothers were able to take $25M of the MEVers&#39; money, which they thought was completely safe, but due to this loophole in the way MEV-Boost worked, was actually not. (The loophole was subsequently patched by having the relay broadcast the signed block body to the network for several seconds before sending it back to the validator, so the validator doesn&#39;t have a chance of getting their own version of the block accepted).</p>\n\n<p>Was this a crime? I honestly don&#39;t know haha. A lot of us were cheering for them at the time, because it was a case of one of the Dark Forest inhabitants who regularly preys on normal users, getting eaten by an even bigger and darker denizen of the Forest. On that battleground, I think a lot of us assume that everything is fair game; if you play that game you&#39;d better be ready to watch your back. But it would appear that the MEVers that got taken advantage of are both wealthy and pissed off, and that&#39;s a recipe for lawsuits. We&#39;ll see what happens. It will be a fascinating case from the &quot;code is law&quot; perspective - the MEV people will have to argue that this was a crime without also implicating their own entire business model in equivalent crimes haha.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-18 09:20:52","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-05-18 14:08:29","id":"l4m90l4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cupmmt","parent_id":"t1_l4lxijk","score":65,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Twelvemeatballs","body":"I am smarter for having read this, thank you","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am smarter for having read this, thank you</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-18 11:42:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l4muqig","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cupmmt","parent_id":"t1_l4m90l4","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/definoob01","body":"I hope this exact post shows up in a courtroom somewhere and those piece of shit MEVers get their ass kicked in court and pay even more than the 25M they've lost.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I hope this exact post shows up in a courtroom somewhere and those piece of shit MEVers get their ass kicked in court and pay even more than the 25M they&#39;ve lost.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-18 09:28:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l4ma5qe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cupmmt","parent_id":"t1_l4m90l4","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nllfld","body":"So crazy to me that these people are sandwiching and then go cry to courts for being sandwiched themselves.

So if the foundation spends 5000 Sol/$750,000 a day to pump the meme markets, it&#39;s a fairly great ROI</p>\n\n<p>In return for spending just 25% of the foundation&#39;s daily staked rewards, VCs like Burniske and Santiago can write tributes about Solana hitting mass adoption, and convince more people to pump money into Solana and solidify it&#39;s place as THE premier smart contract platform, that datacenter validators are a great idea etc (And that 5000 Sol a day isn&#39;t &quot;burned&quot;, you just trade it through memes eating a loss, but I&#39;m going to guess there&#39;s some value left at the end of the washing. So the final expense is much less than even 5000 Sol a day).</p>\n\n<p>This is just my tinfoil hat theory, but I would genuinely not be surprised if something of this nature was taking place.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-18 12:10:10","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-05-18 12:17:28","id":"l4mywfa","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cupmmt","parent_id":"t1_l4mmboo","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Sparta89","body":"Thank for sharing.
