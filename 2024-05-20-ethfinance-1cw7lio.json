It gives an insight to how decisions are made for Ethereum Improvement Protocols (EIPs).\n\nThe topic came up due to [the recent clash between EIP-4337 AA and EIP-3074 AA](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3074-is-unsafe-unnecessary-puts-user-funds-at-risk-while-fragmenting-ux-liquidity-and-the-wallet-stack/19662). The Ethereum Magicians threads for EIP-3074 and EIP-7702 combined now have more replies than any other topic in Ethereum history (including EIP-1559), suggesting that this is the most controversial EIP in history (or maybe the devs just felt really chatty this time). Ethereum researchers wanted 4337, and core devs wanted 3074. Ultimately, there seems to be a compromise via [EIP-7702](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7702.md), which would replace 3074.\n\nThe blog post is worth a read. Personally, I don't agree with Derek's last idea of envisioning Vitalik as a \"CTO\". For me, he's like a famous researcher with a lot of connections ... whom other core devs can ask for assistance to promote their ideas. He still has a lot of influence, but calling him a CTO is quite a stretch.\n\nSo take his post with a grain of salt.\n\nMy takeaways from this (and yours may be different):\n\n* EIP-3074 has been the most controversial EIP in recent history (even though it's been around since 2020 and kept getting pushed back)\n* Ethereum Researchers need to participate in the ACD meetings if they want to champion their ideas. The ACD meetings may gloss over concerns that don't get brought up.\n* There is no formal definition for an Ethereum \"core dev\", though it's somewhat akin to all the developers who regularly participate in the ACD meetings.\n* Ethereum development governance is largely a community endeavor ... still heavily influenced by Ethereum Magicians and layers of informal processes. Ultimately, it's a collection of multiple open source client projects and the communities around them.\n* \"The Roadmap\" often posted by Ethereum researchers seems to have an outsized amount of influence on development through its encompassing vision and media attention. Personally, I don't think it's a one-way relationship where only the Roadmap influences development. It's mutual and bi-directional. The Roadmap is updated quite frequently as ideas from the community shift.\n\n-------------\n\nEdit: Also going to add this tidbit from 2 former Consensys devs about how it's wasn't a monolithic company but a collection of dev projects:\n\n[From wjmelements](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3074-is-unsafe-unnecessary-puts-user-funds-at-risk-while-fragmenting-ux-liquidity-and-the-wallet-stack/19662/23):\n\n> Many Ethereum developers (including myself) are ex-Consensys because it was a huge company.
