Primarily market cap driven. Without delving too much into details, there are various reasons why this is the case (and various arguments why this is a good and bad thing), but the most powerful reason that justifies why this happens is that for capital allocators it ensures that they don't deviate too far to the downside from the market, which is the benchmark on which they are judged. Deviating from market cap weighted is taking an active decision on capital allocation on which you will be judged. And the incentives are set so that deviating for too long to the downside is severely punished (you get fired, your investors flee). So they are incentivized to track the market, which nobody got fired for. ETH is currently 1/3rd of BTCs market cap. So expect roughly that ballpark level of inflows.\n\n- ETFs are highly liquid products. Once both assets have ETFs the barriers of switching from one to the other are very small. A bunch of capital allocation to BTC was simply seeking exposure to a new asset class, not necessarily BTC in itself. But to a new asset class for which BTC ETFs were the only game in town. But the ETH ETFs changes that, and money can flow very easily from BTC ETFs to ETH ETFs. So it can happen that ETH ETFs start extracting value from BTC ETFs. The reverse is not true, initially, because there are simply not ETH ETFs.\n\n- ETH is more sensitive to inflows than BTC. For various reasons:\n\n* 1. It has lower market cap. Every dollar amount of inflows moves the needle more. \n\n* 2. It has lower issuance in nominal and percentage terms, this again means that every dollar of inflows is counteracted by a much smaller quantity of structural selling pressure. Hence resulting in a larger impact.\n\n* 3. It has a cash-flow positive economy built on top. This point is a bit more subtle. Let me illustrate it by looking back at the ICO era vs now. During the ICO era, no product built was cash-flow positive. This meant that all those companies building stuff did so on the backs of ETH raised during their ICOs, ETH they had to sell to be able to cover their expenses adding an intense selling pressure. This has stopped to be true in recent times. L2s are cash-flow positive, protocols built on-top of Ethereum are cash-flow positive. ETH itself has had negative issuance since the merge, resulting in no net selling from the protocol. The ecosystem is healthy and can self-sustain itself ad-infinitum without having to add sell pressure. This is not true for BTC.\n\n- Liquidity and greater sensitivity to inflows means that if ETH starts to move up and does so faster than BTC it could create momentum/positive feedback-loop/reflexivity (various names for the same thing) and money starts to pile up on the better performing asset. Coupled with the highly liquid nature of ETFs it sets up a perfect situation for ETH/BTC to raise, which attracts more inflows...\n\nBonus EDIT:\n\nForgot another point.

But not so much as of Dec 2024.  My intuition of the typical dynamic between US Boomers with retirement savings in investment firms and their advisors goes like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>advisor starts gently suggesting a new investment class to diversity into.</li>\n<li>if the client has general awareness of the class as being a legit thing, then they may eventually greenlight some diversification into it. </li>\n<li>to the degree the new class is totally unknown to them, or the little name recognition they have is based on FUD, then it may take multiple periodic portfolio review meetings before they&#39;re ready to say Yes.  They are inherently risk averse with their retirement nest egg.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bitcoin has much higher brand recognition with this demographic right now than Ethereum (disproportionate to the current 70-30 market cap ratio).  That&#39;s why I suggest the ETH inflows will be spread out over the next 1-2 years.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-25 07:15:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l5m4v6h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1d04f4i","parent_id":"t1_l5lvcjb","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/15kisFUD","body":"I wrote the comment about expecting modest inflows at first yesterday, and this here is pretty much exactly what I expect. .","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I wrote the comment about expecting modest inflows at first yesterday, and this here is pretty much exactly what I expect. .</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-25 08:36:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l5mgwze","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1d04f4i","parent_id":"t1_l5m4v6h","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Mirved","body":"I agree with your points but playing devils advocate based on your first argument also brings a downside.
