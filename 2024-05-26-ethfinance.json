Brian Quintenz now heads A16Z's crypto policy team now and can be considered a decent shot at future SEC chair under Republican admin.\n\nAnother Trump appointee was Brian Brooks. He was Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase and was directly appointed head of OCC. In his very short term he created provisions for banks to custody crypto as long ago as 2020, and offered banking charters to crypto firms for launching stablecoins. Infact, even more than Hester Pierce, it is Brooks who put the most pro-crypto policies and these could have easily lifted the industry forward couple of notches. However, the Biden admin rescinded this on the first day. \n\nAll of which is publicly documented \n\nhttps://www.theblock.co/post/162864/progressive-senators-tell-banking-regulator-to-cancel-brian-brooks-era-crypto-guidance\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/biden-taps-anti-crypto-and-anti-big-bank-law-professor-to-run-the-occ\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/26/who-in-crypto-met-with-brian-brooks-when-he-ran-occ-heres-his-calendar/\n\n> As Donald Trump\u2019s national bank regulator, Brooks met with a wide range of crypto market participants, from Fortune 500 execs to DeFi protocol founders, documents show.\n\nAfter the new admin came in, they rolled back all the pro-crypto policies and even started a witchhunt against Brian Brooks for being pro-crypto, as everyone know of his crypto background at Coinbase.\n\nNot only did current Admin rollback all the pro-crypto policies of Brian Brooks, but went further and did things like arbitrarily closing down pro-crypto banks like Signature Bank - https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1635328056234766337 \n\nUnder the current admin, SEC has been used like a weapon to shut down all crypto activity using enforcement and issued almost no guidance whatsoever. In contrast, under the previous admin, the SEC actually issued guidance on a host of crypto issues like ICOs, the DAO, [framework of investment contract analysis](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) and also including the famous one that labelled ETH a commodity, which one can argue is one of the reason the current SEC wasnt able to go after ETH because they would have to explain why the the earlier SEC's statement was wrong, which would pretty much be uncharted territory for the SEC","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There was a series of posts that were made by others that then got deleted as it went into full political discussion.
