For example, Salesforce uses software one way, Microsoft another, and Snowflake yet another. There are a wide variety of software companies that optimize their software for different purposes, like CRM, word processing, or building communication tools like Slack.*\n\n*Crypto assets are similar. Every crypto asset consists of two things: an asset and a blockchain. There's the Bitcoin asset and the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum asset and the Ethereum blockchain, and so forth. These blockchains can be optimized for different purposes.*\n\n*Bitcoin was the first and is a very simple piece of software. Essentially, you can send Bitcoin, receive it, hold it, destroy it, and execute some basic if-then statements. Every decision Bitcoin makes centers around maximizing security and decentralization. For instance, it doesn\u2019t upgrade very often because upgrades introduce some level of technological risk. The downside of this is that the software is static and can only do a few things. But if you're designing something to be digital gold, all you care about is extreme security. You don't need it to do many things; you just want it to securely store wealth. That's what Bitcoin is.*\n\n*Ethereum, on the other hand, looked at Bitcoin and said, \"It's great that you can store wealth and transfer it globally, but what if we could program it to do everything?\" What if we could program it to act like the New York Stock Exchange, a lending agent, a bank, or a prime broker? What if we could program it to manage ownership of digital art or host digital dollars? This flexibility comes with trade-offs, primarily in terms of security. Ethereum updates more frequently and takes on more technological risk to be more functional.*\n\n*So, what I tell advisors is: if you want to invest in digital gold, that's Bitcoin.
