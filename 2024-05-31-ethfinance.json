Today, I'd like to explain why I consider ERC-721 or 1155 tokens to be one of the most important usecases on our favorite decentralized platform.\n\nIn my opinion, NFTs are paving the way for a new way of making art, in the same way that TV did in the mid-20th century.\n\nThis technology makes it possible to create works that were previously impossible, and I don't think creative people have realized this yet. NFTs are an art form native to blockchain, and therein lies their power.\n\nUntil now, most artists involved in the world of NFTs have been content to sell digital artworks made in the classic way, with a mixture of pencil, Photoshop and Illustrator.\n\nTo me, this represents an uninnovative use of technology. It's the equivalent of the first fictional TV shows, which simply filmed plays. It took several years of trial and error before we realized that TV offered a new way of telling stories - with traveling, for example.\n\nIt's the same for art on the blockchain. Currently, artists mostly simply scan a physical work of art, or save a drawing of a monkey as a jpeg, and mint it on the blockchain. That\u2019s the equivalent of filming a play.\n\nBut a new artistic trend is emerging: an art form native to blockchain.\n\nTake Jack Butcher and his Checks collection (disclaimer, I own Checks). To sum up his concept: the community first minted around 16,000 Checks Editions. Each Edition can be migrated on-chain, and an algorithm determines the number of colors, gradiants, and so on. The new work thus created is called Checks Original.\n\nThese Checks Original can be merged together, but this is entirely at the community's discretion. Jack can't do anything about it; the work is now in our hands (he still controls the Editions metadata). Eventually, we could all work together to create the holy grail of the collection, the Single Black Check, which doesn\u2019t exist yet.\n\nThe Checks collection would have been impossible to create this way without blockchain. It uses the main advantages of this new technology (decentralization, digital ownership, community coordination) to create a new form of artistic expression.\n\nI don't want the debate to be about the merits of the Checks collection or Jack Butcher. Art is art, and I understand that not everyone likes what this person creates. But there's no denying that this is a new art form, one that would have been impossible to create before 2015.\n\nThat's the value of NFTs: they make it possible to create works of art that were previously impossible to create. You only need to know a little bit about art history to realize how rare this is.\n\nPersonally, I'm a (literary) artist in real life, and I've never coded a single line, so I think I have a different perspective from a majority of my friends here. I may be entirely wrong, but I think I am right about the artistic merits of this tech.\n\nThanks for listening to my Ted Talk.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>My NFT thesis</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR : NFTs are enabling the birth of a new art movement native to blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>One of the topics of conversation on the daily yesterday concerned NFTs.
