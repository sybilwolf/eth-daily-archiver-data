It's an exciting place, full of inviting mysteries for curious minds and the potential to change you and the world forever. But it not a place for the faint of heart, the careless, or the unprepared.\n\nThe Rabbit Hole is an unfamiliar wilderness full of unknown dangers and new concepts you don't even have words for yet. The seasonal weather here moves to an unfamiliar rhythm and can easily catch you unprepared so it's wise to always be prepared for stormy weather. You don't know what forage here is edible so it's wise to nibble before making a meal of anything you find. You don't know the customs or intentions of any creatures you meet so it's wise to never be the first to act; watch and observe before interacting. Whenever dealing with the unknown, first slow down and learn what you can before taking any risks.\n\nKnowing the risks, if you still wish to explore this post will serve as something of a scout guide to this wilderness.\n\n**Base Camp One**\n\nJust beyond the looking glass is a bazaar, full of treasures and opportunities that can be found deeper within. I call this place Base Camp One. The layout of this bazaar is highly amorphous. Upon first glance it can all seem overwhelming. You step through the looking glass and find a weird caterpillar sitting on a mushroom puffing smoke rings from his hookah and trying to sell you potions that will change your size. Just past him you find a walrus and a carpenter confidently leading a parade of clams to their doom.

One week you'll find a group of horticulturalists talking about farming yams. By the time you get your head around that the conversation will already have moved on and everyone is listening to some unicorns talking about impermanent loss. A year later, a group of bored apes are talking about building a media empire. Most recently there was a group of philosophers talking about \"intersubjective faults\". You'll find seasonal tribes of frogs, cute dogs, and monkeys aggressively playing a board game you don't recognize or understand the rules to. You'll walk past booth after booth of people promising life-changing riches if only you buy from them but the things they're peddling sound so abstract you have no idea how to even use them let alone value them. If you are lurking around /r/cryptocurrency or crypto Twitter and it's making your head spin, congratulations you made it to Base Camp One.

There are no road signs labeling all the tunnels that branch from here. Most of the proper safety warnings only come from other travelers. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile adventure. By the time you actually understand this strange space the outside world will look bizarre and corrupt and will make your friends doubt your sanity. Just be forewarned it can be perilous. You're either going to come out of Base Camp One wealthier or without pants. Frankly, it's a die roll. The good news is you can tilt the odds in your favor if you follow my first advice: slow down and learn before acting.\n\nThat can be hard at times. The culture here is not one that generally encourages patience. There are many psychological perils that will urge you to break this advice.

Worst of all, most everyone you meet wants something from you, it's not always obvious what, and the mere act of being polite or asking for help can get you into trouble. You need to build vigilance as a habit. As with any habit this requires repetition. What I'd ask of you is that any time you feel someone rushing you to act, **slow down**.\n\nWhatever the current hype cycle is that you read about yesterday, it is not the last opportunity for extraordinary gains in this space.

Especially as I played with worldpvp at the beginning but do not follow it anymore. I love the idea and also love how communities form around these absolutely silly ideas. Do I suggest other people throwing money at it? No, but playing with it and looking at the dynamics at play is great. \n\nI guess ethfinance folks are very defensive against these kind of ponzinomic games as the whole space is so full of absolute rubbish ones which is reflected in the low quality of other subreddits and less strongly moderated discord channels. I dare not to say that we are conservative, but we are definitely not that far out on the degen spectrum here as some other places are. This makes this place healthier than other communities but also slower to accept paradigm changes when they happen. \n\nSometimes this ethfinance defense overshoots and kills discussion of fun and actual novel ideas. Sure, worldpvp will never be the new Minecraft, but it can be a fun way to come together and I love how now communities try to form in this game. Same with the friend tech discussion which turned quite toxic. I do not like how friend.tech works but I played around with it as well and it has shown an interesting way to monetize fame. I am not the target group of such a product, but it could see it become quite powerful if done properly. And yes, I disliked and downvoted all the invite link spamming which made ethfinance worse.

Especially as I played with worldpvp at the beginning but do not follow it anymore. I love the idea and also love how communities form around these absolutely silly ideas. Do I suggest other people throwing money at it? No, but playing with it and looking at the dynamics at play is great. </p>\n\n<p>I guess ethfinance folks are very defensive against these kind of ponzinomic games as the whole space is so full of absolute rubbish ones which is reflected in the low quality of other subreddits and less strongly moderated discord channels. I dare not to say that we are conservative, but we are definitely not that far out on the degen spectrum here as some other places are. This makes this place healthier than other communities but also slower to accept paradigm changes when they happen. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes this ethfinance defense overshoots and kills discussion of fun and actual novel ideas. Sure, worldpvp will never be the new Minecraft, but it can be a fun way to come together and I love how now communities try to form in this game.
