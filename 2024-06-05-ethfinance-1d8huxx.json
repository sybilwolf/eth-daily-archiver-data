Though the latter isn't really a concern if you're using battle tested dapps (Compound and Aave) that have been around for many years without issue. So it's really just the former, but as long as your collateral ratio is high then you'd be pretty insulated from any sudden price drops. You can play around with defisaver [https://app.defisaver.com/](https://app.defisaver.com/) to simulate your liquidation points on various protocols based on your collateral ratio.\n\nMost of these dapps require minimum 125-150% collateral ratio. So if you have 10K in ETH, you can withdraw up to 6.6k of USDC from it. But if your ETH falls below 10K in value it automatically sells your ETH (you get liquidated) to pay back your debt. So you'd want to have a higher collateral ratio to be on the safe side.\n\nSo as a rough example, if you have 10K in ETH, but only borrow 3.3k against it, then your collateral ratio is 300%. you'd only get liquidated if ETH falls like 50%+ (which seems unlikely at this point)\n\nYou'd also have to pay a variable interest rate (this depends on market demand/supply) for the duration of your loan. When I last checked there was a high demand for stablecoins so borrow interest rates were around 15% APR. But if you think ETH is going to go up way higher than 15% over the next year, then paying 15% interest in the short term so that you don't have to sell your ETH early is something you can consider.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Getting liquidated if there is an unexpected crash in ETH price or smart contract risk such as a hack.

So if you have 10K in ETH, you can withdraw up to 6.6k of USDC from it. But if your ETH falls below 10K in value it automatically sells your ETH (you get liquidated) to pay back your debt. So you&#39;d want to have a higher collateral ratio to be on the safe side.</p>\n\n<p>So as a rough example, if you have 10K in ETH, but only borrow 3.3k against it, then your collateral ratio is 300%. you&#39;d only get liquidated if ETH falls like 50%+ (which seems unlikely at this point)</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;d also have to pay a variable interest rate (this depends on market demand/supply) for the duration of your loan. When I last checked there was a high demand for stablecoins so borrow interest rates were around 15% APR. But if you think ETH is going to go up way higher than 15% over the next year, then paying 15% interest in the short term so that you don&#39;t have to sell your ETH early is something you can consider.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-05 17:54:31","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-06-05 18:10:03","id":"l7b013j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1d8huxx","parent_id":"t1_l7asf1y","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/UgotTrisomy21","body":"u/nikola_j is on the defi saver team and I'm sure he's happy to answer any questions you have","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"/u/nikola_j\">u/nikola_j</a> is on the defi saver team and I&#39;m sure he&#39;s happy to answer any questions you have</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-05 17:55:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l7b05hv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1d8huxx","parent_id":"t1_l7b013j","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/icecreamketo","body":"I did this a couple cycles ago and like you the timing was pretty good.

Since November, the community has been working incredibly hard to fix the problems with the current design of the protocol, unleash its true potential as the best liquid staking protocol, and get the protocol growing again.\n\nAfter 8 months of hard work, the community has arrived at the (almost) final form of it's\u00a0[tokenomics rework](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-2024).

The Rocket Pool Investment Thesis really boosted the idea of RPL and staking being intertwined and drove massive attention to Rocket Pool. Then, Fire Eyes designed the tokenomics and put this relationship at the heart of the protocol. The illusion of these being amazing tokenomics started to shatter when growth stalled post Atlas. Since then, growth of Rocket Pool has stalled, and it has started shrinking.\n\nThe original idea was RPL would be used as an entry ticket to outsized eth rewards, the RPL rewards would be attractive enough people would stay above the 10% collateral amount, and that the RPL price should head towards 10% of rETH TVL.\n\nIn reality, this did not work. First, RPL price fluctuates too much and how successful your validators are are too strongly linked to the price of RPL. If RPL goes up, you massively beat solo staking. Conversely, if RPL goes down, you suffer greatly. In addition, the RPL rewards are not enough for people to maintain the minimum collateral amount. Nearly 70% of node operators (NO) are currently under collateralized on their nodes. There are two ways to get back into good standing, 1) top up with more RPL to get above 10% and 2) reduce how much ETH you have staked to improve your collateral ratio. Sadly, more and more people choose the second option. This is not what the protocol should be forcing to happen. Finally, because not enough people top up their collateral, the relationship between the rETH TVL and RPL breaks down. This has consequences on how much rETH the protocol can provide based on eth deposits from NO.\n\nThe current system is brittle, and having RPL as a bond along with ETH has shown to be hugely flawed. So, what are we going to do about it? This brings us to Part 2.\n\n[Part 2 - Tokenomics rework](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-explainers/002-rework-intro)\n\nUnder the new system speculation in RPL and being a node operator are separated. You will not need RPL to stake your ETH with Rocket Pool. On top of that, holding RPL will become a desirable action due to its standalone investment properties. If you choose to stake RPL alongside your ETH, you get higher ETH yield! You can speculate all you want, but it will not be forced on you from the protocol. Also, there will be no lower 10% cliff to punish smaller amounts of collateral.\n\nThe new tokenomics will allow smaller ETH bonds. This is fundamental to changing how the protocol generates revenue - income from ETH staking rewards. Charging a 3.5% commission on borrowed eth gives the following boosted rewards compared to solo staking: 8 ETH bond is a 10.5% boost, 4 ETH bond is a 24.5% boost, and 1.5 ETH bond is a 71.2% boost! These bonds will be safe to use because of node level penalties and forced validator exits. RPL inflation will be reduced from 5% to 1.5% as rewards to NO from inflation will not be required.

First, we get an explanation of how the protocol will generate revue and what will happen with that income. The protocol will still charge rETH holders 14%. Currently, this 14% goes to NOs. However, paying NO 14% of 30.5 ETH of rETH is too much especially at lower bond amounts. The revenue can be more effectively used elsewhere. So, where will the revenue go? There will still be a NO commission share, we will have a new RPL voter share, and there will be a \"surplus\" share. NOs will get eth similarly to how they get it now but there will be no rpl requirement. Those who stake RPL alongside their ETH will get the voter share. The surplus amount will be used to buy back and burn RPL (this is one area that is currently undecided - other value capture methods are still being considered).\n\nLet's work out the numbers. The 14% of commission will be divided as follows: 3.5% will go to the node operator, 5% will go to RPL stakers, and 5.5% will go to the surplus. Here the same person could get rewarded in one way as a node operator (NO share), one way as an RPL holder (RPL burn), or all three ways for a person who stakes ETH and RPL. While, the minimum stake is the primary, and indirect, value capture for RPL in the current system, there will now be two direct value capture methods. This is how there is no need for RPL inflation to go to NOs. This new mechanism will open up possibilities for many different kinds of node operators such as those who want to stake ETH only, how much RPL they want and feel comfortable with, and RPL holders get direct protocol revenue too.\n\nFor a NO, while it might seem like commission going down from 14% to 3.5% sounds bad. The reality is that you'll be getting 3.5% on a much bigger amount of ETH than you currently do. Currently, an 8 ETH validator needs 8 ETH and 2.4 ETH of RPL. That person can earn 1.14x solo staking. However, this amount becomes 1.01x solo staking at RP maturity. If the RPL ratio goes down, however, that person would earn 0.82x solo staking. Under the new system, an 8eth validator would get 1.11x solo staking with no other dependancies.\n\nOnce we look at lower bonds, the numbers are mind blowing. The amount of rewards dramatically outperform solo staking. As mentioned above, a 1.5 ETH validator will be earning 1.71x solo staking rewards. Smaller bonds are much better at capital efficiency. There are, however, limits to just how small the bonds can get. This is because of protections needed for rETH holders such as slashing insurance etc. In the first set of Saturn upgrades, it's likely we'll require a 4 ETH bond per validator. In Saturn 2, we'll have some new tools to allow the 1.5 ETH bonded validators, but the first 2 will 4 ETH validators. That is because we will get forced exits which will provide a huge security boost.\n\nRocket Pool will introduce Universal Adjustable Revenue Split (UARS) to balance between the different groups in the community. NO share, voter share, and surplus share will all be adjustable through the UARS. If we are running low on NOs, we can increase the commission to them to make staking more attractive. We can incentive more staked RPL to make sure governance attacks are less likely. Altering the surplus share can help balance rETH demand by making that more or less attractive. This will mean the pDAO needs to be more responsive to the changing dynamics within the protocol.\n\nThere are three main value capture mechanisms for RPL being explored using the surplus share. These are buy and burn (use eth income to buy RPL and burn it), buy and provide liquidity (use eth to add buy side liquidity to a RPL/rETH pool), and a greater voter share (to make RPL stakers get more of a share of the commission ETH). This is one of the areas where community discussion is still taking place.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-explainers/003-rework-foundation\">Part 3 - Foundation of the rework</a></p>\n\n<p>In this section is where the real explanations start to happen.

How the f*** does someone with 3.3M followers randomly post a scam-link to a pump dot fun page but it's not a scam? \n\nHow the f*** does someone, when confronted with these rumors, upload a video of themselves with a facefilter that's so edited that their eyebrows are flying all over the screen, appearing but reappering, but its not actually a fake Caitlyn Jenner facefilter but the real Caitlyn Jenner? \n\nHow the f*** does someone work with an Indian scammer who is launching several of these pump dot fun coins (you can see how the coins are all coming from the same address) who's dumping it for a measly $16,000 profit right away but it's not actually a scam, Caitlyn Jenner is just a fucking retard who appears to be doing business this way? \n\nI am cast into the spotlight of the scene in massive confusion. I am chasing down zoomers on Twitter. \"Can you not see that it's a scam???\" I'm yelling to them but they won't listen. \"The eyebrows are floating all over the screen, you're acting like easily-duped boomers!\". \"It's just an instagram filter bruh they act  upthat way\" They reply.\n\nI don't use Instagram facefilters a lot. It's me. I'm the boomer. To make matters worse I even bought the $JENNER scam coin with the $78 I had in my Phantom wallet. But it turns out I had clicked a scam link and bought $BAXTER, \"Caitlyn Jenner's Dog\" coin, which went to 0 even faster than $JENNER. \n\nIn my confused anger, I start googling the name of the Indian scammer behind this and I find a Decrypt article. The Decrypt article contains a link to the Indian scammer's Telegram page where he's announcing the coins he's launching. He says the next coin he's about to launch will make $JENNER look small. He says it's Iggy Azalea (I also don't know who that is because again, I'm a boomer). \n\nIggy has tweeted, she says she spoke to Sahil (the Indian scammer) \"enough to know he a bitch\"\n\nOK IGGY, let's see. In his Telegram group, Sahil seems very confident that Iggy *is* going to launch a coin though. Exciting I thought, let's see what's actually going to happen. Sahil says \"40 more minutes\". \n\nI check Iggy Azalea's instagram, and she's uploaded a video where two Asian men are sitting locked in with a computer in front of them. One of them looks EXACTLY like Sahil. \"10 more minutes\" Sahil says, and then Iggy drops the pump dot fun link on her Twitter.\n\nI don't buy it. It's clearly from the Indian scammer again. I can fucking see him sitting at the table behind her. \n\nExcept it's not Sahil. It's her brother. She tells me this in a reply to Twitter, and explains that the only reason she dropped her own coin was to frontrun the Sahil-scammer so he wouldn't make money off of her name. She was frontrunning his scam by jumping into the game herself.\n\nIt was unbelievable, but true. \n\nThen she joins a Twitter space with Ansem, Udi and a bunch of other people. She starts talking. She is confident, she's secure. She says all the right things. \"I pay all my designers in crypto, they won't take anything else\". \n\nThe coin is pumping. $20 million marketcap. I have my Phantom Solana wallet loaded up with $15,000 USDC. The pump dot fun link tells me $MOTHER is already trading on Raydium. It's 2 am for me, I'm on sleeping pills, trying to go to sleep, but Iggy is making too much sense. \n\nTwo years ago, I had predicted this. Simp queens and memecoins go hand in hand. One day we shall see the arrival of a Simp queen who truly understands Web3, who can rally the simps of the Internet and usher into a new Era. Ultimately, they will form SimpDAOs.\n\nI text Udi \"This is it. This is her.\" \n\nUdi knows what I mean. Two years I could not talk about anything else. I hit market buy on Raydium. Nothing happens. It's 2 am in the morning, I'm on sleeping pills trying to go to sleep and I just want my order to hit the books before I can collapse.\n\nIt's not working. The order doesn't get filled. Raydium isn't working. \"Increase your slippage tolerance\" they say. I set it to 1%. 2%. 5%. 10%. Buy, buy, buy. I want $MOTHER. I know it. I feel it. I must frontrun the simps. \n\nWhen Iggy speaks, I hear that it's her. The $MOTHER ticker is genius. When you read it, it says SMOTHER. It's a reference to her twerking ass. It's brilliant. I am baffled, I am amazed. For 3 hours I spam the buy button on Raydium, nothing happens, it is failing.\n\n\"You need to use Phuckton\", Udi says. I don't know what it is. \"You can't buy things on Solana you must use a Telegram bot\". What? I don't understand, it's 4 am, I am drowsy. I keep spamming the button, nothing happens. \n\nIt's the next day. Or the day after that, I am not sure, everything is dizzy. I'm walking around outside, listening to podcasts in my airpods. Anatoly is debating Justin Drake. And he's laughing. For two whole hours, he is laughing, snickering, at Justin. It's so disrespectful. \n\nI check Dexscreener, $MOTHER is making new all-time highs, Iggy is twerking again. Anatoly is laughing. Her asscheeks are clapping and he's laughing.\n\nVitalik is tweeting. He says he's not impressed by the lack of utility of celebrity coin like Iggy's but he doesn't get it. Vitalik gets Stage 0 centralized rollups, but he doesn't get Stage 0 SimpDAOs like $MOTHER. It's OK, Vitalik is not meant to get it. *I* get it. But I'm sidelined.

Next cycle will happen but on much smaller scale. </p>\n\n<p>Doom and gloom enough?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-05 13:00:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l79odz2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1d8huxx","parent_id":"t1_l79ecz2","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/JebediahKholin","body":"Doom and gloom is that we pop to 10k, then dribble down to 8k and we all sell thinking the cycle is over and the bear is coming and then it rockets to 150k as squishcha0s cackles\u00a0","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Doom and gloom is that we pop to 10k, then dribble down to 8k and we all sell thinking the cycle is over and the bear is coming and then it rockets to 150k as squishcha0s cackles\u00a0</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-05 13:03:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l79ozao","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1d8huxx","parent_id":"t1_l79ecz2","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/fiah84","body":"boredom\n\nwithout a killer app, if people get bored of the idea of ethereum they'll sell and exit and never come back unless said killer app arrives or prices go parabolic again","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>boredom</p>\n\n<p>without a killer app, if people get bored of the idea of ethereum they&#39;ll sell and exit and never come back unless said killer app arrives or prices go parabolic again</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-05 12:20:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l79h6hf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1d8huxx","parent_id":"t1_l79ecz2","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-05 07:01:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l77wm3g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1d8huxx","parent_id":"t3_1d8huxx","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"Ledger collects a ton of data and they force you to be online when initializing and updating with Ledger Live.
