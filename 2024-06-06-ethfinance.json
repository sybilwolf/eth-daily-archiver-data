The mind blowing part is they improved the speed quite a bit. They say it can handle around 300 MGas/s. As a comparison, Ethereum mainnet currently does 1.25 MGas/s. This means that processing an Ethereum block would just take 1.25/300 = 1/240 times the normal block time. Meaning that block processing will now take up even a smaller part of the 12s block time. If we would crank the the node to its limit it could process around 2500 tx/s 'real' or 14000 pure ETH tx/s. Sure, a node does more than just validating that all transactions in the block are valid, so one cannot really crank it up to the absolute limit, but it definitely shows how far they have come. They say they did these tests on consumer hardware which seems to be true as my NUC13i5 has pretty much the same block processing speed as their setup. The amazing part is they improved the speed by over a factor of 4 since since January. In my understanding, this test does not consider state bloat over time and how this will reduce the execution speed and limit the transactions that can actually been handled. Nevertheless, it is great to see how much nodes can still be improved if the teams put their mind into it. We will not see that Ethereum mainnet will handle these many transactions tomorrow, but I expect we will see tx/s increases on rollups in the coming months thanks to optimizations like that. I am so looking forward installing this new release when it comes out.\n\nhttps://x.com/NethermindEth/status/1798354578930565507","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Nethermind is teasing their upcoming release.

The amazing part is they improved the speed by over a factor of 4 since since January. In my understanding, this test does not consider state bloat over time and how this will reduce the execution speed and limit the transactions that can actually been handled. Nevertheless, it is great to see how much nodes can still be improved if the teams put their mind into it. We will not see that Ethereum mainnet will handle these many transactions tomorrow, but I expect we will see tx/s increases on rollups in the coming months thanks to optimizations like that. I am so looking forward installing this new release when it comes out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/NethermindEth/status/1798354578930565507\">https://x.com/NethermindEth/status/1798354578930565507</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-06 10:57:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l7emtgk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1d9ab4c","parent_id":"t3_1d9ab4c","score":37,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/eth2353","body":"The release candidate is out!\n\nI still have my very first staking machine, a NUC8i5, that I am trying this out on.
