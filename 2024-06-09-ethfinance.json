That may keep some regular investors from wanting to get involved. An experienced poker player recognizes the bet they have in front of them and looks at the situation differently. When bitcoin was at $100 or $1000, this was an asymmetrical bet, the most you could lose was $100 or $1,000 per coin, but the upside was almost infinite gains as bitcoin could go to millions.

Most players know it's not wise to draw to an inside 'gutshot' straight as they only have 4 outs (cards that can make their hand)...they also know of the 52 cards in the deck they hold 2 of them and there are 4 community cards on the board, so 52-4-2 = 46 unknown cards, giving them the odds to make their gut shot straight 4/46 or 8.7% of the time. Now the player needs to calculate pot odds with respect to whether it is worth calling a bet to see the final river card. If the pot has $100 in it and the bet they are facing from an opponent is $50, they would have to call $50 to win $150 ($100 pot + $50 opponent bet). For an inside straight draw, that is an easy fold from a mathematics standpoint. But if the opponent bets only $5 into that $100 pot, the 8.7% odds for the gut shot draw is actually worthwhile because in the long run the pot odds are in the player's favor as the $5 call to win $105 is about 4.8%. Additionally, the player has implied odds on the call or not call decision, because when they make their hand they have the final betting round to possibly take more money from their opponent.\n\nNowadays, the risk of ETH or BTC going to zero is much less, but the upside reward does not have the same multiples as when they were much cheaper and the timeframe is much longer.
