Then the protocol unstakes funds and once it is your turn in the queue you can retrieve your eth\u2026\n\nNow Renzo seems to just fill the buffer with new deposits and staking rewards and (maybe?) unstaked eth and if you want to withdraw there needs to be enough in the buffer already or your  transaction to initiate a withdrawal request \\*reverts!\\* - no queuing or anything like that.\n\nI questioned this in their discord (if you can only withdraw if there is enough in the buffer) and at first just got a response with stated \u201cThe buffer is currently getting filled with rewards and deposits\u201d.\n\nWhich didn\u2019t answer my question at all so I pointed that out (quote: \u201cSo?

You can&#39;t initiate a withdrawal correct?\u201d)  and\u2026 got called\u2026 rude? by another team member which said I should read the announcements and listen to the community call and all my questions would be answered and *of course* they have a withdrawal queue and whatnot\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Well the community call is an hour long and mostly pointless ramblings and one could have done a 5 minute presentation explaining everything essential without wasting anyones time but alas such is the way of billion dollar projects in ours space\u2026 And of course I read all the announcements\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Okay\u2026</p>\n\n<p>So I had to go and quote them the actual line in the smart contract where it shows that your tx gets reverted and low and behold another team member (I guess an actual engineer) did say that my assumptions are correct and they did this because it was safer, faster and easier this way\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Fine, well my guess is there will be one big shitshow in their discord once they enable the UI functionality because the buffer will be instantly drained and they probably won\u2019t have nearly enough unstaked from eigenlayer to fulfil the demand for exits\u2026   aaaah nah I am sure it will be fine :)</p>\n\n<p>Users will have to periodically check the site and if they are lucky that the buffer is not empty they will have to pray that no one else gets a tx in before them\u2026</p>\n\n<p>How much does Renzo have in TVL again? Can\u2019t be that much right\u2026<br/>\nAh I get cynical in my old days it seems\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Guess I will try to trade out of my ezeth instead of unstaking, maybe should have done so before posting about this in their discord and here but I love <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a> :) And I guess most people don\u2019t research anyways where they put their money\u2026 (Renzo TVL - what is it again?)</p>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, in their \u2018annoucements\u2019 they also stated they would publish the audit reports before they upgrade the contracts\u2026.<br/>\nContracts have been upgraded Friday - no reports to be found\u2026</p>\n\n<p>I asked how much eth they unstaked from eigenlayer for the launch of withdrawals but didn\u2019t receive an answer\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Well\u2026 Good night and good luck to all :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-11 14:47:05","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-06-11 14:54:13","id":"l86iw7w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dd65dm","parent_id":"t3_1dd65dm","score":41,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/the-A-word","body":"Thanks for sharing the deep dive..this kind of attention and diligence is why I'm here","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for sharing the deep dive..this kind of attention and diligence is why I&#39;m here</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-11 18:06:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l87clu0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dd65dm","parent_id":"t1_l86iw7w","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"Paying previous depositors with the money of new entrants.

Also the &quot;company&quot; that was running the campaign changed its website and founders halfway through the campaign which prompted me to change my wallet in case they&#39;d hack the ones that transacted with them.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-11 10:07:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l854jkc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dd65dm","parent_id":"t1_l852of9","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/_WebOfTrust","body":"would you mind share details of the team/project ? any link, you can also DM me. \n\nI will check and what you are saying is correct, it is possible to request a fund crawlback from the project.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>would you mind share details of the team/project ? any link, you can also DM me. </p>\n\n<p>I will check and what you are saying is correct, it is possible to request a fund crawlback from the project.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-11 11:01:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l85eku3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dd65dm","parent_id":"t1_l854jkc","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/EternalShadowBan","body":"clique.tech - used to be clique.social","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>clique.tech - used to be clique.social</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-11 11:36:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l85kv3u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dd65dm","parent_id":"t1_l85eku3","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/_WebOfTrust","body":"thank you","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>thank you</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-11 11:37:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l85l321","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dd65dm","parent_id":"t1_l85kv3u","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/nikola_j","body":"I really don't get it.

They used qualifying criteria which require a bit more effort than most sybils put in to filter out low quality users. But for those who genuinely put in the effort to explore the ecosystem, people who held other airdrops 6 months after the drop and folks who are OG's going back to the Gitcoin ZKSync + ZKSync lite days got multipliers which can stack on top of each other.\n\n#Here's the important facts:\n\n**Drop info:** https://docs.zknation.io/zk-token/zk-airdrop\n\n**Eligibility claim page** (which is super based as you don't even need to connect your wallet): https://claim.zknation.io/\n\n**Snapshot date:** March 24, 2024 00:00:00 UTC \n\n**Claim date: Week of June 17th, 2024 --> January 3rd, 2025**\n\n**Total Supply: 21,000,000,000**\n\n**Amount Airdropped: 17.5% / 3,675,000,000 tokens**\n\nOf which:\n\n- **Users (89%):** ZKsync users who have transacted on ZKsync and met a threshold of activity to qualify for the airdrop.\n\n- **Contributors (11%):** Individuals, developers, researchers, communities, and companies who contributed to the ZKsync ecosystem and protocol through development, advocacy or education\u2014regardless of their network usage.\n\n**The latest price on [whales market](https://pro.whales.market/pre/zkSync/ZK) is $~~$0.90~~,~~0.25~~, $0.35 and $0.37 on Aevo.**\n\n#Eligibility:\n\n- **Contract interactions**: Interacted with at least 10 non-token smart contracts on ZKsync Era. (Eligible contracts must have had at least 30 days of activity)\n\n- **Paymaster activity:** Used paymasters for at least 5 transactions on ZKsync Era\n\n- **Token trader:** Traded at least 10 distinct ERC-20 tokens on ZKsync Era DEXs\n\n- **DeFi liquidity provider:** Provided any amount of liquidity to tracked DEXs and Borrow/Lend protocols on ZKsync Era\n\n- **Libertas Omnibus holder:** Held at least 1 Libertas Omnibus NFT at snapshot\n\n- **ZKSync Lite Activity:** Active for more than 3 distinct months on ZKsync Lite before ZKsync Era mainnet\n\n- **Gitcoin donor:** Donated to Gitcoin via rounds hosted on ZKsync Lite\n\n#Allocation\n\n>Allocations for eligible addresses was based on a value-scaling formula. This formula adjusts an address\u2019s allocation based on amounts sent to ZKsync Era and how long those crypto-assets have stayed on the wallet. That is to say, an address with 100 USD sent to ZKsync Era at mainnet launch will be weighted more than an address who only put 100 USD a month before snapshot. Crypto-assets held on ZKsync Lite do not count when determining an address\u2019s allocation.\n\n**TL;DR: It's a time x value weighted formula with assets in DeFi getting a 2x multiplier.**\n\n#Multipliers\n\n>Each address could receive multipliers based on activity that signaled a high likelihood of human behavior or contribution to ZKsync. These multipliers apply on top of eligibility and allocations from ZKsync Era and Lite usage.\n\n- **NFT Holder:** Hold one of these ZKsync native NFT collections at snapshot: Dudiez, Hue, Moody Mights, Webears, ZKPENGZ, zkSkulls, or zkVeggies.\n\n- **ZKSync native token holder:** Hold at least $50 of one of these ZKsync native ERC-20 tokens at snapshot: AAI, HOLD, KOI, MEOW, MUTE, RF, ZF, ZORRO.\n\n- **Smart Wallets:** Smart Contract Wallets created via ZKsync Era native account abstraction.\n\n- **Airdrop Holder:** Held at least 50% of the ARB/OP/ENS airdrop for more than 90 days after claiming.\n\n- **Smart Contract Adoptoooor:** In the first 1,000 addresses to interact with qualifying Ethereum smart contracts at least two times. A qualifying contract is one with at least 100 ETH in transaction fees spend on it.\n\n#Minimum & Maximum Token Allocations\n\n>After Step 3, each address was assigned a token allocation. Addresses had to meet a **minimum requirement of 450 ZK** and were **capped at a maximum of 100,000 ZK**. Addresses with fewer than 450 ZK had their tokens recycled back into the pool. Addresses with more than 100,000 ZK had their excess tokens recycled back into the pool as well. These tokens were then redistributed and brought the minimum allocation up to 917 ZK.\n\n#Sybil Detection\n\nThis is a short but interesting read. I think they did a pretty good job when you consider that the bar to entry was slightly higher than normal. The TL;DR is they looked for **CEX Deposit Address Reuse** and **Wallet Funding Source Patterns**, both of which are basically which wallets the sybils are connected/linked back to.\n\n#Contributors\n\nThis is the small 11% portion of the 17.5% airdropped token supply. Basically if you're any of the following:\n\n**Builders:** GitHub Developers with 25+ commits in certain repos,\nprotocol guild members, ZKsync GitHub Discussion Helpers, ZK Quest Participants, Security Researchers, Community Moderators of ZKStars, ZKsync Event POAPs, ZK Credo Translators.\n\n**NFT Holders:** Pudgy Penguin and Milady Maker Holders\n\n**Airdrop Recipients:** $DEGEN and $BONSAI airdrop recipients.\n\n**\"Crypto The Game\" Participants:** I haven't heard of this but if you've played in season 1 or 2 you're eligible.\n\n----------------\n\nSo in conclusion I think this is an amazing drop. I'm disappointed that solo stakers weren't included in the contributors section but to be fair that does make a lot of extra wallets qualify and there's always a fuss from how they officially define who is and isn't a solo staker, so I understand if they want to avoid such drama.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Me: There is no perfect airdrop now that the airdrop meta is out of the bag</p>\n\n<p>ZKSync: Hold my beer</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Needless to say I am very impressed with the airdrop criteria here.

But for those who genuinely put in the effort to explore the ecosystem, people who held other airdrops 6 months after the drop and folks who are OG&#39;s going back to the Gitcoin ZKSync + ZKSync lite days got multipliers which can stack on top of each other.</p>\n\n<h1>Here&#39;s the important facts:</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Drop info:</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.zknation.io/zk-token/zk-airdrop\">https://docs.zknation.io/zk-token/zk-airdrop</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Eligibility claim page</strong> (which is super based as you don&#39;t even need to connect your wallet): <a href=\"https://claim.zknation.io/\">https://claim.zknation.io/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Snapshot date:</strong> March 24, 2024 00:00:00 UTC </p>\n\n<p><strong>Claim date: Week of June 17th, 2024 --&gt; January 3rd, 2025</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Total Supply: 21,000,000,000</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Amount Airdropped: 17.5% / 3,675,000,000 tokens</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of which:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Users (89%):</strong> ZKsync users who have transacted on ZKsync and met a threshold of activity to qualify for the airdrop.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Contributors (11%):</strong> Individuals, developers, researchers, communities, and companies who contributed to the ZKsync ecosystem and protocol through development, advocacy or education\u2014regardless of their network usage.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The latest price on <a href=\"https://pro.whales.market/pre/zkSync/ZK\">whales market</a> is $<del>$0.90</del>,<del>0.25</del>, $0.35 and $0.37 on Aevo.</strong></p>\n\n<h1>Eligibility:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Contract interactions</strong>: Interacted with at least 10 non-token smart contracts on ZKsync Era. (Eligible contracts must have had at least 30 days of activity)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Paymaster activity:</strong> Used paymasters for at least 5 transactions on ZKsync Era</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Token trader:</strong> Traded at least 10 distinct ERC-20 tokens on ZKsync Era DEXs</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>DeFi liquidity provider:</strong> Provided any amount of liquidity to tracked DEXs and Borrow/Lend protocols on ZKsync Era</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Libertas Omnibus holder:</strong> Held at least 1 Libertas Omnibus NFT at snapshot</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>ZKSync Lite Activity:</strong> Active for more than 3 distinct months on ZKsync Lite before ZKsync Era mainnet</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Gitcoin donor:</strong> Donated to Gitcoin via rounds hosted on ZKsync Lite</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Allocation</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Allocations for eligible addresses was based on a value-scaling formula. This formula adjusts an address\u2019s allocation based on amounts sent to ZKsync Era and how long those crypto-assets have stayed on the wallet. That is to say, an address with 100 USD sent to ZKsync Era at mainnet launch will be weighted more than an address who only put 100 USD a month before snapshot. Crypto-assets held on ZKsync Lite do not count when determining an address\u2019s allocation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: It&#39;s a time x value weighted formula with assets in DeFi getting a 2x multiplier.</strong></p>\n\n<h1>Multipliers</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each address could receive multipliers based on activity that signaled a high likelihood of human behavior or contribution to ZKsync. These multipliers apply on top of eligibility and allocations from ZKsync Era and Lite usage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>NFT Holder:</strong> Hold one of these ZKsync native NFT collections at snapshot: Dudiez, Hue, Moody Mights, Webears, ZKPENGZ, zkSkulls, or zkVeggies.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>ZKSync native token holder:</strong> Hold at least $50 of one of these ZKsync native ERC-20 tokens at snapshot: AAI, HOLD, KOI, MEOW, MUTE, RF, ZF, ZORRO.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Smart Wallets:</strong> Smart Contract Wallets created via ZKsync Era native account abstraction.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Airdrop Holder:</strong> Held at least 50% of the ARB/OP/ENS airdrop for more than 90 days after claiming.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Smart Contract Adoptoooor:</strong> In the first 1,000 addresses to interact with qualifying Ethereum smart contracts at least two times. A qualifying contract is one with at least 100 ETH in transaction fees spend on it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Minimum &amp; Maximum Token Allocations</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>After Step 3, each address was assigned a token allocation. Addresses had to meet a <strong>minimum requirement of 450 ZK</strong> and were <strong>capped at a maximum of 100,000 ZK</strong>. Addresses with fewer than 450 ZK had their tokens recycled back into the pool. Addresses with more than 100,000 ZK had their excess tokens recycled back into the pool as well. These tokens were then redistributed and brought the minimum allocation up to 917 ZK.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Sybil Detection</h1>\n\n<p>This is a short but interesting read. I think they did a pretty good job when you consider that the bar to entry was slightly higher than normal. The TL;DR is they looked for <strong>CEX Deposit Address Reuse</strong> and <strong>Wallet Funding Source Patterns</strong>, both of which are basically which wallets the sybils are connected/linked back to.</p>\n\n<h1>Contributors</h1>\n\n<p>This is the small 11% portion of the 17.5% airdropped token supply. Basically if you&#39;re any of the following:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Builders:</strong> GitHub Developers with 25+ commits in certain repos,\nprotocol guild members, ZKsync GitHub Discussion Helpers, ZK Quest Participants, Security Researchers, Community Moderators of ZKStars, ZKsync Event POAPs, ZK Credo Translators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NFT Holders:</strong> Pudgy Penguin and Milady Maker Holders</p>\n\n<p><strong>Airdrop Recipients:</strong> $DEGEN and $BONSAI airdrop recipients.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Crypto The Game&quot; Participants:</strong> I haven&#39;t heard of this but if you&#39;ve played in season 1 or 2 you&#39;re eligible.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>So in conclusion I think this is an amazing drop. I&#39;m disappointed that solo stakers weren&#39;t included in the contributors section but to be fair that does make a lot of extra wallets qualify and there&#39;s always a fuss from how they officially define who is and isn&#39;t a solo staker, so I understand if they want to avoid such drama.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-11 01:36:26","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-06-11 02:45:02","id":"l83795a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dd65dm","parent_id":"t3_1dd65dm","score":43,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"High quality airdrop.\n\nSo many criterias, most people who are genuinely active onchain with volume will land at least one category.\n\nI missed plenty, and some of these misses feel painful.
