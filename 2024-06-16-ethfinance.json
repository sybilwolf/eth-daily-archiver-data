Focusing on more than 1 big quality account was really smart and that's one of my main takeaways: have 5ish big juicy legit farmor accounts with a deeply rich history and previous qualifications and go at it. It also allows for easier and more pleasant farming because it's not that tedious to repeat.\n\n\u2022 Giving up small sybilling accounts.\n\nZKsync had 9M+ wallets and only ~696k qualified.

Airdrop farming was and still is one of the most lucrative ways to gain the edge. However, I would argue that the edge lies in whaling some metrics or in the ability to access those resources to pump up your stats, and lesser accounts without that capital are unable to compete, therefore missing out on the great R/R play which in turn makes it worthwhile for lower value portfolios.

Historically, it has also been true to wait for a pump within days or a week, sometimes up to 16ish days or in rare cases for up to 1.5 months. With those things in mind, I can see a dump, a post-dump pump and I'm personally hoping for a cope pump - you know, that type of pump that TIA had.
