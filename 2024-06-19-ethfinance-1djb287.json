By necessity, this excludes some detail due to length constraints. There are links at the bottom if you'd like to read in more detail.\n\n**Major Changes** - (Likely to be where people have strong opinions)\n\n* Allow ETH-only nodes\n* No more RPL rewards, and less RPL inflation (5% -> 1.5%.)\n* No more RPL staking cliff to receive rewards.\n* rETH fee remains at 14% initially, though may be changed by RPL stakers via vote in the future.\n* Node Operators get 3.5% commission on borrowed ETH (down from 14% for NOs currently)\n* RPL staking nodes share 5% of the commission from all nodes (ETH-only nodes included), proportional to their vote-eligible staked RPL.\n   * The consequence of this is that RPL staking node operators get more rewards the more ETH-only node operators there are. Low RPL demand -> more ETH-only nodes -> Increases reward for RPL staking -> Higher RPL demand -> More RPL staking nodes. The hope is this comes to a natural equilibrium based on market judgement of RPL price risk versus the value of the extra ETH revenue.\n* 5.5% of commission from all nodes (ETH-only nodes included) *may* go to buy RPL and then burn or LP against rETH. Alternatively, this could accrue to RPL staking Node Operators alongside the 5% above. (community hasn't coalesced around a favoured option yet.)\n\nInitial numbers may change, and may be tweaked by RPL stakers via vote in the future.\n\n**Major Additions** - (IMO fairly non-controversial, but please comment if you have thoughts)\n\n* Megapools - Reduce gas cost of node creation and operation.\n* Smaller ETH Bonds - Improved capital efficiency for Node Operators.\n\n**Links for more info**\n\n* [Tokenomics Rework Homepage](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-2024)\n* [Introduction to the Rework](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-explainers/002-rework-intro)\n* [Differences various types of user would experience](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-explainers/002-rework-intro#personas)\n\nMinor note: Communicating percentages of percentages is annoying.

Specifically, I&#39;m here looking for feedback from &#39;outside of the bubble&#39; to take back to the major contributors, so this is a chance to complain in a way that may have some positive impact. <strong>Important disclaimer:</strong> None of this has been voted on by vote-eligible RPL yet.</p>\n\n<p>Short summary of the headline items is below. By necessity, this excludes some detail due to length constraints. There are links at the bottom if you&#39;d like to read in more detail.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Major Changes</strong> - (Likely to be where people have strong opinions)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Allow ETH-only nodes</li>\n<li>No more RPL rewards, and less RPL inflation (5% -&gt; 1.5%.)</li>\n<li>No more RPL staking cliff to receive rewards.</li>\n<li>rETH fee remains at 14% initially, though may be changed by RPL stakers via vote in the future.</li>\n<li>Node Operators get 3.5% commission on borrowed ETH (down from 14% for NOs currently)</li>\n<li>RPL staking nodes share 5% of the commission from all nodes (ETH-only nodes included), proportional to their vote-eligible staked RPL.\n\n<ul>\n<li>The consequence of this is that RPL staking node operators get more rewards the more ETH-only node operators there are. Low RPL demand -&gt; more ETH-only nodes -&gt; Increases reward for RPL staking -&gt; Higher RPL demand -&gt; More RPL staking nodes. The hope is this comes to a natural equilibrium based on market judgement of RPL price risk versus the value of the extra ETH revenue.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>5.5% of commission from all nodes (ETH-only nodes included) <em>may</em> go to buy RPL and then burn or LP against rETH. Alternatively, this could accrue to RPL staking Node Operators alongside the 5% above. (community hasn&#39;t coalesced around a favoured option yet.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Initial numbers may change, and may be tweaked by RPL stakers via vote in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Major Additions</strong> - (IMO fairly non-controversial, but please comment if you have thoughts)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Megapools - Reduce gas cost of node creation and operation.</li>\n<li>Smaller ETH Bonds - Improved capital efficiency for Node Operators.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Links for more info</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-2024\">Tokenomics Rework Homepage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-explainers/002-rework-intro\">Introduction to the Rework</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rpips.rocketpool.net/tokenomics-explainers/002-rework-intro#personas\">Differences various types of user would experience</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Minor note: Communicating percentages of percentages is annoying. The total 14% fee taken from rETH is split into 3.5% (all Nodes), 5% pooled (between vote-eligible staked RPL), 5.5% pooled (to buy RPL or between vote-eligible staked RPL.)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-19 07:21:16","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-06-19 09:11:40","id":"l9b8l9s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1djb287","parent_id":"t3_1djb287","score":40,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BroncoMontana78","body":"I think it checks the box on the \"what\" needs to be done to make rocketpool competitive.
