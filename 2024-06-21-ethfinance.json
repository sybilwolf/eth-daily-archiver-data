Basically, I have noticed that there is a spectrum of how deep down the rabbit hole crypto investors go which very strongly correlates to how financially successful they are with their crypto investments.\n\n**In my experience, there are 3 types of people in crypto.** These are:\n\n1. People who don't understand it but buy some just in case. They hold on an exchange or a basic cold wallet and listen to someone like you or me who says just buy ETH and forget about it. ***These people win in the long run because they spend no time in the ecosystem proper and so don't get exposed to scams and don't check price enough or aren't over-invested enough to freakout when it crashes.***\n\n2. People who see the potential to make money and dive in. They get themselves over-exposed to crypto financially because they see the upside. In an effort to get rich quick they buy all sorts of shitcoins but they aren't crypto native enough to avoid scams and low quality projects. They're also over-invested and get panic when the price crashes. ***These people lose in the long run due to chasing pumps, investing into scams and panic selling in the bear.***\n\n3. Crypto natives like us who dive in deep enough to take the full advantage of this opportunity. Due to spending so much time in this space, we can identify scams and shitty projects so we can keep ourselves safe. We may be over-invested but we know how not to lose irresponsible amounts and we remain comfortable with our investments in the hardest of times because we know what Ethereum will be in 10 years or more. This is and always has been a long term investment, despite what the explosive gains in a short time period often signal to normies. ***These people thrive because we know this space from the inside out.***\n\n*Now this last part was part of another comment I made directed at someone considering sending some friends who keep asking about shitcoins deeper into the ecosystem.*\n\nWhat you are doing is you're trying to push your investor #1 type friends into being investor #2 type friends. In my experience, investor #3 type friends would have already gone deep down the rabbit hole on their own accord because they are driven by more than just the financial opportunity. We thrive on the economic, technological and social frontiers we are innovating on. But investor type #2 is still just here for the money and doesn't have the understanding or critical thinking skills to see when someone is trying to peddle bullshit to them. As a result, their keenness to make money gets exploited and they fall for scams because they're overwhelmed with FOMO when they're pitched the new hot shitcoin or the next \"big paradigm shift\" shilled by crypto demagogues like Charles Hoskinson.\n\nSo please, make sure that if your friends aren't sending themselves down the path towards being investor #3, give them the least amount of information needed to remain safely in the investor #1 class. I cannot begin to explain just how many times I have seen people get rekt because they were investor #2.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m not sure why I haven&#39;t written about this before but this is something I&#39;ve noticed quite clearly over the years amongst almost everyone I know and I can&#39;t really think of any exceptions to the rule.
