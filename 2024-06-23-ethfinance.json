It really increased by over a factor of 3 on average. What also happened though, is that the standard deviation increased as well by a factor of 4 from 27 MGas/s to 100 MGas/s. The standard deviation is a measure of the variation in the block throughput in each block import.

For example, some block imports can be speed up by a factor of 4, whereas some others can only be speed up by a factor of 2. This leads to a higher spread in block throughput and therefore in a higher standard deviation. What this means is that rollups using Nethermind cannot just increase their block sizes by a factor of 3 now, as the higher variation would sometimes delay the block import too much to build the next block on top of it.

Unlimited supply cap: Without a supply cap, there is no limit to the number of tokens that can be created, which could lead to inflation and devaluation of the token.\n\n2. High buy/sell/transfer taxes: Taxes of upwards of 15%, 25%, 33%, and higher on receipt of the token significantly reduces the value of the token.\n\n3. Whitelisted addresses can issue new tokens: The ability for whitelisted addresses to create new tokens at a ratio of 9:1 could lead to dilution of the token's value and potential manipulation.\n\n4. High concentration of ownership: With 1% of holders owning 30% of the supply, there is a risk of price manipulation and centralization.\n\n5. Large circulating supply: 27 trillion tokens in circulation is a very high number, which could lead to liquidity issues and difficulty in maintaining a stable price.\n\n6. Poor market performance: Being in a bear market since its inception suggests that the token has not performed well and may continue to decline.\n\n7. Misleading marketing: Marketing itself as \"safe\" could be a red flag, as it may not accurately reflect the token's risks and potential downsides.\n\n8. Toxic community: A toxic community can create a negative environment and discourage potential investors.\n\n9. Lack of funny memes: As a memecoin, a lack of engaging and humorous memes could hinder its popularity and adoption.\n\n10.
