Anecdotally, it feels like we'll see a few days of steady growth, gaining a couple of subscribers each day, with one \"pullback\" of negative subscribers. Ironically it seems to match the performance of ETH in some ways, though overall the two don't seem strongly correlated (i.e., didn't see huge inflows of subscribers on huge up days, nor do I always see a huge exodus on dumps). I am in no way associated with this site but subredditstats was tracking subreddit performance before the API changes, now current data are unreliable. Legacy info would still hold and you can see a graph of this sub's growth since 2020 here: [ethfinance subreddit stats](https://subredditstats.com/r/ethfinance). Again this is not my work and as the red text says make sure to take with a grain of salt post API/reddit policy changes. \n\nNotably there was one day where we gained over 500 subscribers in a single day. This was a few weeks before the ETF stuff all came to a head. I'm a pretty steady lurker here and ready just about every comment daily; again, this is purely anecdotal from one random dude on the internet, but if I had to pick one way or another, it seemed like there was an uptick in noise after this--I tried to pay special attention to sentiment following this increase and it seemed like people whose opinions I've come to know and trust over the years were commenting on an increase in FUD. Granted, that could just have been related to the ETF stuff anyway, so who freaking knows. Either way, I remain curious that we had such a substantial and marked increase on one single day.\n\nOverall, personally, I'm not fundamentally opposed to adding members, though I have to say that like others I am so grateful for the high signal to noise quality that comes from this sub.

Anecdotally, it feels like we&#39;ll see a few days of steady growth, gaining a couple of subscribers each day, with one &quot;pullback&quot; of negative subscribers. Ironically it seems to match the performance of ETH in some ways, though overall the two don&#39;t seem strongly correlated (i.e., didn&#39;t see huge inflows of subscribers on huge up days, nor do I always see a huge exodus on dumps). I am in no way associated with this site but subredditstats was tracking subreddit performance before the API changes, now current data are unreliable. Legacy info would still hold and you can see a graph of this sub&#39;s growth since 2020 here: <a href=\"https://subredditstats.com/r/ethfinance\">ethfinance subreddit stats</a>. Again this is not my work and as the red text says make sure to take with a grain of salt post API/reddit policy changes. </p>\n\n<p>Notably there was one day where we gained over 500 subscribers in a single day. This was a few weeks before the ETF stuff all came to a head. I&#39;m a pretty steady lurker here and ready just about every comment daily; again, this is purely anecdotal from one random dude on the internet, but if I had to pick one way or another, it seemed like there was an uptick in noise after this--I tried to pay special attention to sentiment following this increase and it seemed like people whose opinions I&#39;ve come to know and trust over the years were commenting on an increase in FUD. Granted, that could just have been related to the ETF stuff anyway, so who freaking knows.
