Paging u/TechnologyLong2714 and u/reuptaken.\n\nFor those not aware, a collect few of us have been exploring ways to access defi completely on mobile/ipad. Of course it\u2019s no problem if you want to save your private keys on your phone (wtf) but if you want to be smart and use a hardware wallet well suddenly all of your options dry up. Why might you want to do this? Well in my case it\u2019s fairly niche, but I travel a TON and thanks to my iPad mini i basically don\u2019t need a computer anymore, but it\u2019s gotten to the point that I\u2019m lugging a laptop around just so I can connect my hardware wallet the once a month I'm collecting an airdrop or taking advantage of an arbitrage, etc. Being able to do \\_everything\\_ on mobile with a hardware wallet is the holy grail for me.\n\n**tl;dr** Get a ledger nano X and connect it to Rabby and use their \u201cexplore\u201d browser. It\u2019s not pretty/smooth but it\u2019s fully functional. Thanks for the tip u/reuptaken\n\nNow of course you\u2019re going to be using a ledger nano x as that\u2019s all that\u2019s out there, so start with that. Here\u2019s what I explored.\n\n*Ledger Live App* - got damn is this app a hot piece of garbage. In theory you can connect your nano x via Bluetooth and either use the \"native\" apps (which just loads up their in app browser) or you can use wallet connect. I didn't see any way to navigate to a custom URL via their browser, so wallet connect it is for 99% of use cases. Not only do the \"native\" apps barely work if at all, but the wallet connect functionality is terrible. It makes you reconnect your ledger for every single signature, and half the time the tx or signature fails anyway. I was literally unable to make a swap on uniswap with this method. Also, when it detects that your ledger firmware is out of date, it doesn't let you do ANYTHING until you update your ledger ON A DESKTOP. I would say this is not the future of france but seeing  where Ledger is HQ'd....yikes\n\n*Metamask Mobile* - ledger teamed up with metamask to add native support for the nano x via bluetooth with the metamask mobile app. This looks like it would be quite slick if it wasn't for one glaring problem, which is that metamask mobile doesn't even ask you what type of address you have (legacy, etc) and so if you've been around for a while then you'll have to move everything over to a new address and simply hope that all those years of activity don't lead to airdrops which will now be unaccessible without a desktop.\n\n*Rabby* - ahh, we finally have some competence in this space. I think they added support only a few months ago, but I've been able to do everything on my nano x through the mobile rabby app. They have an in built browser and it comes with all the rabby features you know and love. Sure, it's still not as smooth as desktop, but I've been traveling with nothing but an ipad mini and a small backpack for a week now and i can actually access my money. Mindblowing.\n\nThis post may come across as angry or sarcastic but honestly this little experiment has left me in a bit of shock. I'm surprised with all of the mobile wallets and mobile-first development happening in crypto that you're an outlier as soon as you try to use crypto with a hardware wallet (i.e. best practice). The UI for all this has been appallingly bad, and we are never going to get mainstream defi adoption if this is what the mobile space looks like. That being said, I'm still happy that I can sell my laptop and go 100% computer free.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>God damn fucking hell guys I\u2019ve finally solved the case on going computer-free while staying crypto-native. Paging <a href=\"/u/TechnologyLong2714\">u/TechnologyLong2714</a> and <a href=\"/u/reuptaken\">u/reuptaken</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For those not aware, a collect few of us have been exploring ways to access defi completely on mobile/ipad. Of course it\u2019s no problem if you want to save your private keys on your phone (wtf) but if you want to be smart and use a hardware wallet well suddenly all of your options dry up. Why might you want to do this? Well in my case it\u2019s fairly niche, but I travel a TON and thanks to my iPad mini i basically don\u2019t need a computer anymore, but it\u2019s gotten to the point that I\u2019m lugging a laptop around just so I can connect my hardware wallet the once a month I&#39;m collecting an airdrop or taking advantage of an arbitrage, etc. Being able to do _everything_ on mobile with a hardware wallet is the holy grail for me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Get a ledger nano X and connect it to Rabby and use their \u201cexplore\u201d browser. It\u2019s not pretty/smooth but it\u2019s fully functional. Thanks for the tip <a href=\"/u/reuptaken\">u/reuptaken</a></p>\n\n<p>Now of course you\u2019re going to be using a ledger nano x as that\u2019s all that\u2019s out there, so start with that. Here\u2019s what I explored.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ledger Live App</em> - got damn is this app a hot piece of garbage. In theory you can connect your nano x via Bluetooth and either use the &quot;native&quot; apps (which just loads up their in app browser) or you can use wallet connect. I didn&#39;t see any way to navigate to a custom URL via their browser, so wallet connect it is for 99% of use cases. Not only do the &quot;native&quot; apps barely work if at all, but the wallet connect functionality is terrible. It makes you reconnect your ledger for every single signature, and half the time the tx or signature fails anyway. I was literally unable to make a swap on uniswap with this method. Also, when it detects that your ledger firmware is out of date, it doesn&#39;t let you do ANYTHING until you update your ledger ON A DESKTOP. I would say this is not the future of france but seeing  where Ledger is HQ&#39;d....yikes</p>\n\n<p><em>Metamask Mobile</em> - ledger teamed up with metamask to add native support for the nano x via bluetooth with the metamask mobile app. This looks like it would be quite slick if it wasn&#39;t for one glaring problem, which is that metamask mobile doesn&#39;t even ask you what type of address you have (legacy, etc) and so if you&#39;ve been around for a while then you&#39;ll have to move everything over to a new address and simply hope that all those years of activity don&#39;t lead to airdrops which will now be unaccessible without a desktop.</p>\n\n<p><em>Rabby</em> - ahh, we finally have some competence in this space. I think they added support only a few months ago, but I&#39;ve been able to do everything on my nano x through the mobile rabby app. They have an in built browser and it comes with all the rabby features you know and love. Sure, it&#39;s still not as smooth as desktop, but I&#39;ve been traveling with nothing but an ipad mini and a small backpack for a week now and i can actually access my money. Mindblowing.</p>\n\n<p>This post may come across as angry or sarcastic but honestly this little experiment has left me in a bit of shock. I&#39;m surprised with all of the mobile wallets and mobile-first development happening in crypto that you&#39;re an outlier as soon as you try to use crypto with a hardware wallet (i.e. best practice). The UI for all this has been appallingly bad, and we are never going to get mainstream defi adoption if this is what the mobile space looks like. That being said, I&#39;m still happy that I can sell my laptop and go 100% computer free.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-25 15:39:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"laa1c3t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dnxzmo","parent_id":"t3_1dnxzmo","score":31,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"Is it really so bad storing keys in a phones secure enclave?
