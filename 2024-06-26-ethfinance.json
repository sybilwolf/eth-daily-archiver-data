As any meme, it's an oversimplification of the reality with the purpose of maximizing how easy it's to spread. I get that. I also get that it was born as a response to the even more stupid meme of Bitcoin is sound money because 21M. But in my opinion it has gone a step too far in oversimplifying the economics of ETH and it may come back to bite us. It has been oversimplified to mean deflationary issuance, to the point people celebrate when ETH is deflationary and get worried when it stops being so. This is wrong. ETH is not inherently deflationary, nor inflationary. In fact, the underlying model is even more beautiful, ETH's economics are adaptive. It allows the market to find equilibriums for total circulating supply, yield, security, and price of ETH. This is even more amazing because you don't need to tinker parameters (cue the Fed raising or lowering interest rates) in a quarterly fashion to adapt to the economic conditions or have a fixed issuance schedule that breaks when you don't have sufficient security budget. The market does the hard job and discovers all those equilibriums for you, the monetary policy sets the right incentives to ensure those equilibriums exist. This is what the ultrasound money should be about. Ultrasound monetary policy. I know it's less catchy, won't spread as easily. But we won't need to pivot when the oversimplified memes are proved to be wrong. If ETH is successful, it will inevitably exit the deflationary regime and become inflationary. Because what makes ETH inflationary or deflationary is the interplay between those equilibriums. If ETH succeeds and acquires monetary premium then that's because it's being acquired above its natural usage levels. Gold has monetary premium because it's not being bought to be used in electronics or industrial processes, it's being bought above these levels to store it. The usage of ETH is to feed the EVM as fuel, burning it in the process. If ETH is being created above its consumption levels then it's inflationary. A successful ETH future looks like: low yield, slightly inflationary, high price given its usage.\n\nSorry to quote myself.
