Fluid was discussed and initially I decided to put some of my collateral there.\n\nHowever, before actually making the transaction, I looked at their audit report. It was done by [StateMind](https://statemind.io/) who publish [their reports on GitHub](https://github.com/statemindio/public-audits/blob/main/README.md).\n\nI noticed that [the report for Fluid](https://github.com/statemindio/public-audits/blob/main/Instadapp/2023-12-29_Instadapp_Fluid.pdf) contained 3 criticals and 8 high findings. I thought that was rather high, so I compared it to the other audits by StateMind to see if this was normal.\n\nIt seems it is indeed the audit with the most findings. Followed closely by Lido v2, which has 1 less critical, but also a smaller scope (in number of files). In the end 5 out of 14 clients had at least one critical finding.\n\nI did not consider the *actual* scope of the audits, only the amount of files. This gives an idea about the scope, but a file can be 5 lines or 500, so it is far from decisive. A smaller code base will usually result in less findings.\n\nThese results strengthen my hesitance to use Fluid while it is still so young. I think that I'll wait a bit longer to see how it ages.\n\nTo clarify: I'm **not** saying that Fluid is insecure. They resolved all these findings.\n\nI'm just saying that I was already hesitating on using a dapp as young as Fluid. Especially since it would lock my collateral in their platform for a potential long time. Their audit report merely pushed me towards caution.

If you\u2019re going to put a computer on every person, car, building, dog, whatever in the world then we <em>need</em> it to be more fair. </p>\n\n<p>The Banks/Wall Street are value extractors and parasites\u2026 while also running the financial machine of the richest country in the history of the world. You can be thankful for the ability to walk down the street and buy a hamburger, new clothes, and then have someone come a pick you up to drive you home- <em>while also saying that they\u2019re taking too much</em> there\u2019s no reason with the technology we have that credit card companies should be charging small businesses 3% fees, why banks can take your funds, invest them to earn easy profits, give you a pittance in return and then end up insolvent anyway. There\u2019s no reason we should be selling Fidelity our information to make a trade for us on the free market- oh and these middle men might cut you off for doing so because <em>they</em> decide you\u2019re taking too much risk, or there\u2019s too much market volatility. A game has been set up where \u201ceverybody wins!\u201d But the big players get to win waaaay more than us. </p>\n\n<p>This is an America-centric view, as I\u2019m American. But the same things can be said everywhere. The use case for Ethereum is clear to me. </p>\n\n<p>It can be a middle-man mass extinction event. A direct challenge to the rent extractors that have become a bit too common. No Apple telling you what apps you can or cannot be built. No Fidelity telling you can only place that trade during market hours, and we will be selling your data to whoever while you make it. No Visa taxing your business 3% on every transaction bc no one carries cash anymore. </p>\n\n<p>It can be a corruption/lie detector. We can audit the banks in real time. We can use stablecoins instead of local fiat currencies that may be hyper inflated away by the incompetence or corruption of a local government. We can know in real time when institutional level capital is dumping on us- and it won\u2019t happen while the market is closed. </p>\n\n<p>And one of my favorites- maybe one day it can allow us to verify identity on the internet, without exposing privacy all the time. I\u2019ll finally know whether the people in this thread are bots, without myself or anyone else (including advertisers or governments) knowing who you are if you don\u2019t want us to.  Something in between \u201cI\u2019m an American!\u201d -French guy . And \u201chere\u2019s my social security number can I post a picture of my dog now Mr. Facebook?\u201d The internet has made the liars and the propagandists too powerful. AI will make it worse. Even politicians may be able to get a better pulse on what their constituents want through polling/prediction markets. </p>\n\n<p>We don\u2019t need a \u201cnew app\u201d although there are possibilities there that are exciting. We just need a properly scaled and decentralized blockchain that can express some of these ideas. And as it does, it can attack the moat of these centralized incumbents and distribute value back to smaller investors. Ethereum can do it, I hope.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-27 05:21:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"laifgdg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dpj7ve","parent_id":"t3_1dpj7ve","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheCryptosAndBloods","body":"You've read The Master Switch by Tim Wu I assume? \n\nCovers the evolution of information businesses from the telegraph to radio to movies, to TV, to the Internet in the USA (Written in 2010 so effectively pre-crypto and actually before the complete takeover of the Internet by 5 companies). \n\nHe essentially says that all information businesses start off decentralized, chaotic and creative and consolidate over time into being controlled by a few incumbents with government support/approval.
