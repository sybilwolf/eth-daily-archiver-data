They are not wrong. So I will attempt to explain why there's a world of difference between a Bitcoin Maxi and an Ethereum Maxi.\n\nIt's strange, because I was really, *really* late on Ethereum, and *really* into Bitcoin. Not only was I completely oblivious to its existence until 2017, I even initially dismissed it as another altcoin that's going to zero. Up until 2018, I was essentially a Bitcoin Maxi. After a few short months or reading up on several coins, getting heavily rekt in the 2018 crash betting on NANO, and educating myself about crypto, I had completely converter to Ethereum. And I left Bitcoin completely behind.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nGresham's law states that bad money drives out good money. The good money that is driven out is hoarded, so if it is scarce, it increases in value. Many people understand this as \"Crypto will always outperform Fiat because it's better money\". But there's another angle to it. In my opinion, this applies even more strongly **within** the highly liquid and interconnected crypto ecosystem, sucking value out of *every single Altcoin* and giving it to the leading crypto, which is the one that has the most \"moneyness\". During this process, the leading crypto builds even more status as *money*, and altcoins are dismissed as bad investments at best or scams at worst.\n\nEvery cycle, once the speculative frenzy dies out, and it eventually does, every single crypto ends up being valued exactly as a company stock: according to the current and future profits it can bring to the holder, taking into account the potential for its future growth. For most altcoins, that means following an asymptote to zero, since they don't really have any profits.\n\nWhy has Ether escaped this fate for a couple of cycles? After all, Ethereum is constantly regarded as one of the *most undervalued altcoins* not just by Ethereans (of course we would think that) but even by neutral Altcoiners. \"Ethereum can only dump after good news\" is a meme in most crypto subreddits. But somehow Etherum persists. In my opinion, this can be explained because even though in the minds of the majority Ethereum is still an altcoin, it's again valued as a stock: according to its profits. It's seen as undervalued precicely because a lot of speculative value has evaporated due to it having been around for a couple of cycles. The fact that it's not only profitable, but the **only** profitable altcoin (OK there's also BNB and maybe TRON with some light profits) is the reason it is not following every single other crypto to oblivion.\n\nEvery single crypto... except one. The one that in the minds of the majority is the best money. The one that every single cycle, without fail, will be the safe haven that's not going to zero, because it has a hard support of rabid acolytes that see it as the best money on Earth. Bitcoin.\n\nSo, sometime during Ethereum's development, I think some very smart people realized that this is the game. As a result, Ether is the only crypto that has worked and fought to be seen as a better money. Ultrasound money might or might not be the best attempt to communicate that to the general public, but in my opinion is very apt.\n\nEthereum is an absolutely unique altcoin in this regard, because from the moment it was created, its scope and capabilities exceeded Bitcoin's by such a huge margin, that it could legitimately claim to be the money of the crypto ecosystem, superseding Bitcoin.\n\nMany of you think there's room for both BTC and ETH on the ecosystem. Sure, there's room for both, if BTC is the money and ETH keeps being valued as a stock. If BTC reaches $1M and ETH reaches $12K.\n\nBut if you want a $150K Ether, then you just can't have Bitcoin being seen as the better money. And if Bitcoin ceases to be seen as the better money, it's not even going to be in the top 20 on Coinmarketcap.\n\nSo, when you people try to be moderate with Bitcoin Maxis in order to drive a civilized discussion you miss the fact that this is impossible. The smart Maxis *know* that Ethereum is a **mortal threat** to Bitcoin. There's no civilized discussion that can happen in light of this fact. They can only dismiss Ethereum as the worst shitcoin, because acknowledging it might lead some moderate Bitcoiners or people that are on the fence to jump ship. And when you've build a personal brand and an entire livelihood on Bitcoin being the best money, you might not be able to do the same. But even though you might know that Ethereum is objectively better money, you do have some very strong weapons to fight back. The early Bitcoiners are some of the wealthiest people in the ecosystem. They can help launch \"Ethereum killers\" and pump them 2000%. They can spread FUD. They can go on podcasts and shit on Ethereum non-stop. The vitriol and dismissal I've seen against Ethereum from smug Maxis is not even *close* to other altcoins.\n\nBecause they realize the fact that you can have many cryptocurrencies and a thriving ecosystem, but not all of them can be money. Crypto needs a King. And so far,  this Maxi strategy is working, because it keeps Bitcoin's network effect intact and damages Ethereum's. And the network effect is the **only** thing that gives money its value.\n\nSo, I am an Ethereum Maxi. But here's the difference: I am not an Ethereum Maxi because I can't move to Bitcoin. I am late enough to be neither rich or have buit a business around Ethereum. I'm a Maxi because Ethereum is just better. So, unlike Bitcoin Maxis, I don't really have to resort to arguments found at the lowest levels of Graham's argument pyramid. I can make intelligent points, refute Maxi's stupid arguments, *and* be an Ethereum Maxi myself. It's easy, because there not even a conflict. The world benefits *along* with my bags, which I think is pretty rare.\n\nSo be a Maxi, because what Ethereum is trying to do is neither easy nor certain.  We are coming for the King, and we *definitely* best not miss.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>On Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Altcoins</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many people might have noticed that I&#39;m one of the most vehemently anti-Bitcoin people in here, and also very often diss Altcoins.

And I don't see a 0-to-1 value proposition in AR the way I can see it for smartphones and LLMs.\n\nI see two main hurdles for AR. First, there's many constraints that will damper its use for large chunks of the population. People get dizzy - and because women are biologically more likely to get dizzy with AR and most engineers are men, it's likely products will be built wrong for a long time. Case in point, pharmaceuticals are STILL tailored to men as a baseline in this day and age even though we have ample data to show the particulars end up quite inappropriate for women in many cases. Women are the biggest drivers of consumption trends, and products only ever hit global scale when they're useful to women.\n\nFor that matter I have little doubt failures of blockchain are tied to this.

You don't quite get this dynamic with AR; if anything you get the opposite, you're isolated in your little bubble. Perhaps one might argue years of social media and filter bubbles have primed us for this, hence the lack of pushback similar to the \"Glassholes\" in 2012-2013. I would just as readily retort nobody wants to be alone. We just don't want to be around the \"bad\" kind of people.\n\nWhat is going to be the killer app for AR to bypass this? A LLM agent whispering into your ear for whatever you look at could be it. Even then, we've discussed the ChatGPT numbers above. Even better models, mindblowing stuff like Claude Sonnet 3.5, barely gets any mindshare. You can offer to give people superpowers for free and they won't actually make use of it if it requires initiative. You have to literally force the superpowers on them, you have to run aggressive marketing and you have to activate the superpowers on their own, for the person to only be a recipient. Ultimately that person will only become an user if enough other people, enough of their friends, use the product. For people to use the product the experience would need to be *tight*. This is not an easy problem to solve and I'm not convinced it will be solved by 2030.\n\nFor that matter, even if it were solved, I'm not convinced it would matter. Consider how the average person - not you, not me - uses their smartphone. They're generally doing one of three things:\n\n- texting/calling\n\n- listening to music\n\n- scrolling through a feed of predominantly videos/pictures\n\nWhen you think about it, smartphones act as portable television + phone + boombox. That's the killer app. Not novel usage, but form factor. The many latency issues (that frankly frustrate me with phones as much as you, I wager) do not matter because the speed is actually fine for most people.\n\nYou can hardly compel from portable to \"more portable\", when the former is already portable enough. Having videos play right in front of your eyes, even if you don't care about losing your situational awareness, does not seem a powerful enough unlock over watching your phone screen. Especially as the slightest bug fills up your field of vision, instead of being tied to a device remotely tucked in the palm of your hand. \n\nI suspect the advantage of being hands-free is actually a disadvantage: part of the addictive power of the phone is precisely because there is a tactile element to it. Passive activities can end up feeling active through the feedback of your finger tapping and swiping. You will lose that dimension with a pair of glasses.\n\nOn a personal level, I'm still confused by how exactly you're supposed to navigate these devices. I've skimmed through videos talking about voice control or pressing buttons on the glasses. Clearly, having to raise your arm to press a button cannot be as efficient as swiping a screen once you picture doing the gesture thousands of times in a day. As for voice, even if we assume instant recognition, this would also be slower than the many hand gestures you can make in an instant.\n\nI could see a boost in terms of, say, asking an AI \"hey Meta, how do I get to the nearest WalMart?\" and have it enter navigation mode and give you directions verbally, rather than look for Maps app, open, type Walmart, look for the nearest one... But I don't see a boost in the much more common pattern of, user goes on Instagram and will swipe no less than 500 times in one session, sometimes several times per second. Even if you were in a situation where you could say \"next\" to the AI and have it execute (that sounds like fun in public transportation), it's going to be an uphill battle to make it as responsive as your own fingers on the screen.\n\nKind of shooting from the hip here and welcoming your rebuttals if any.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>In my opinion Meta could do an easy 3-5 x when augmented reality glasses are going to replace the smartphone (which I am 100% sure it will) within maybe ~5 years </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting perspective.</p>\n\n<p>If we define &quot;replace&quot; as &quot;more AR devices are bought than smartphones&quot;, I have less confidence this will happen by 2030 than I have about AGI.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, in my view of the world it would likely take supraintelligence upending social norms to the point a large portion of the world population to get into elaborate virtual worlds, for that kind of market penetration to occur in that timeframe.</p>\n\n<p>Some comparison points: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>first smartphones came around 2002, first successful smartphone was the iPhone in 2007, smartphone sales overtook &quot;dumb&quot; mobile phone sales only by the mid-to-late 2010s, roughly a decade later</p></li>\n<li><p>ChatGPT went mainstream more than one year ago, and even with their absolute explosive growth and generous free plan they are looking at ~100m daily users.
