My schedule is generally pretty packed with side events, and I've met a number of people who didn't even buy a main event ticket because so much is happening elsewhere. But I never got accepted to today's side event [searcher.wtf](https://lu.ma/searcher.wtf), they only reveal the location to accepted participants, and I didn't really care to use connections to get in, so might as well check out the EthCC venue. Conveniently, today featured a track of staking and protocol related talks with the EthStaker name attached. Generally sounded more interesting than the MEV event anyway. I'd go crazy if I only ever lived in MEV land.\n\nThe EthCC venue is pretty good. Large amount of space, well maybe too much, it's a bit of a maze. Good rooms for talks, potentially too many (why have a dozen different stages if there's only like 3 parallel tracks maximum?). A food court in the building, though it ran out of food really early. So uhhhhh maybe a bit of a mixed bag. The WiFi was solid I guess? There is [a page on the website](https://ethcc.io/live) which should have livestreams for each stage; I haven't confirmed that these work and also don't know if the talks get archived anywhere.\n\nHad to take a bit of time in the morning shopping for a *grounded* power outlet adapter, because I forgot my usual one at home and the one I grabbed quickly in an airport during a connection is only 2-prong. But I eventually checked in to the conference, picked up my badge (where I apparently listed my job title as \"Human\"), and made it to some talks:\n\n* Marius van der Wijden of go-ethereum wanted to convince the audience that MEV infrastructure is bad and you shouldn't let your friends do MEV. He highlighted generally questionable stuff like optimistic block submissions, private order flow, and timing games. Also listed a few recent incidents involving the BloXroute relay. And yeah, it's pretty bad that a relay running closed-source buggy code can cause real problems on Ethereum when they mess up. He suggested locally building blocks when possible, using non-censoring relays, and setting high `--min-bid` values.\n* Parithosh Jayanthi of the EF and ethPandaOps discussed the tooling used in Ethereum interop events. The biggest accomplishment it seems was really fleshing out the tooling for running local devnets, which allowed for much faster iteration. And with Dencun interop the group had a working devnet on day 1 because local devnets led to so many bug fixes, and they had to work to find other things to do over the 5-day event. Also discussed the new Assertoor tool, an \"import\" option for quickly establishing a working base L1 config, and using the execution-spec-tests defined by the EF testing team rather than duplicating that effort.\n* Caspar Schwarz-Schilling and Ansgar Dietrichs of the EF motivated their recent work on ETH issuance, and Christine Kim of Galaxy provided some critiques. Caspar and Ansgar say that the ETH demand curve currently \"doesn't express a strong opinion about where it stops\", while the supply curve has been \"going down\" in the sense that staking has become more accessbile and de-risked, leading to a higher amount of ETH staked for the same amount of yield. Problems with a high % of ETH staked include low real yield despite nominally being ~2%, reliance on MEV/restaking to turn a profit, LSTs benefiting from increased economies of scale and improved \"moneyness\" compared to ETH, and a higher risk of a \"too big to fail\" NO creating a difficult slashing situation. Christine's main criticism is that while these are all problems, it's not clear that they're caused by high ETH stake % and can't be mitigated through other changes--would they really go away with lower stake totals?\n* Justin Drake of the EF painted an optimistic picture of the Execution Auction future. Under Execution Auctions, proposal rights for slot n+63 are auctioned off during slot n, and ILs become fairly mandatory for giving proposers some censorship resistance power over the winning proposer. With EAs (or other APS) the effects of timing games, MEV spikes, proposer commitments, and any other overloading of Ethereum proposer duties get moved out of the hands of proposers to more specialized actors, and the additional value the proposers earn from the extra duties largely end up burned. I was surprised to see that so few people in the audience knew of the concept, so glad it got presented. Though I will mention that while the benefits are there as listed, the devil is really in the details and there are some serious issues remaining to work out.\n* Will Shannon of Lido talked about Lido's progress in decentralizing their validator set. They're very proud of their NO diversity and transparency. The DVT module currently represents 0.5% of Lido stake, but recently [a DAO vote](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xaca2da3c932542e030db8bf5b6e4420bf4aa98bd57bd62b9b8008a4b7398abb2) approved an increase to 4%. Today there are 180 \"independent NOs\" participating (70% identified as \"solo or community\" validators), with 55 more in the pipeline to be added, with an expectation of reaching 300+ this year. The Community Staking Module is coming soon and is aimed to onboard 5000 independent NOs. They claim to have the best UX and bonding curve. Generally good to see dual governance and a wider validator set take off though--[*cough*](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x10abedcc563b66b1adee60825e78c387105110fa4a1e7354ab57bc9cc1e675c2) sorry [*cough*](https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590#goal-3-steth-is-the-most-used-token-in-the-ethereum-ecosystem-13) sorry.\n* Glovin of Heroglyphs provided a pretty high level overview of the project. They think about the different phases of the token distribution lifecycle, and see heroglyphs as specifically a distribution layer aiming to be maximally fair by allowing tokens to be mined only by complete validators via custom block graffiti. I was hoping for a little more details about the complex systems they've set up for genesis NFTs, validator IDs, badges, tokens, blah blah blah. Because I get the concept (and have my reservations) but haven't done a deep dive into the complex system they've built on top of it.\n* liftlines of Nimbus talked about what they're working on, specifically highlighting their four different clients. The first is obviously their consensus and validator client, which he emphasized has a somewhat-unique feature of being able to connect to multiple other clients (VC -> (BN1 + BN2), and BN -> (EL1 + EL2)). Their verified web3 proxy is a light client that runs on phones which can request and verify Ethereum state in place of a centralized RPC. They're working on an EL client, which they intend to be lightweight and will be available as a standalone binary or combined EL+CL binary. Their Portal Network client, Fluffy, will allow retrieval of historical state and will be tightly coupled with their other clients.\n\nBack to side events the next few days. Though tomorrow's is right next to the main venue so if I get bored I guess I can jump between them.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>EthCC Day 2</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dy0lbc/daily_general_discussion_july_8_2024/lc8wah6/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p><sup>Pardon</sup> <sup>me,</sup> <sup>just</sup> <sup>catching</sup> <sup>up</sup> <sup>on</sup> <sup>two</sup> <sup>days</sup> <sup>at</sup> <sup>once.</sup></p>\n\n<p>Today was the first day of the <a href=\"https://ethcc.io/\">main EthCC event</a>.

But I eventually checked in to the conference, picked up my badge (where I apparently listed my job title as &quot;Human&quot;), and made it to some talks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Marius van der Wijden of go-ethereum wanted to convince the audience that MEV infrastructure is bad and you shouldn&#39;t let your friends do MEV. He highlighted generally questionable stuff like optimistic block submissions, private order flow, and timing games. Also listed a few recent incidents involving the BloXroute relay. And yeah, it&#39;s pretty bad that a relay running closed-source buggy code can cause real problems on Ethereum when they mess up. He suggested locally building blocks when possible, using non-censoring relays, and setting high <code>--min-bid</code> values.</li>\n<li>Parithosh Jayanthi of the EF and ethPandaOps discussed the tooling used in Ethereum interop events. The biggest accomplishment it seems was really fleshing out the tooling for running local devnets, which allowed for much faster iteration. And with Dencun interop the group had a working devnet on day 1 because local devnets led to so many bug fixes, and they had to work to find other things to do over the 5-day event. Also discussed the new Assertoor tool, an &quot;import&quot; option for quickly establishing a working base L1 config, and using the execution-spec-tests defined by the EF testing team rather than duplicating that effort.</li>\n<li>Caspar Schwarz-Schilling and Ansgar Dietrichs of the EF motivated their recent work on ETH issuance, and Christine Kim of Galaxy provided some critiques. Caspar and Ansgar say that the ETH demand curve currently &quot;doesn&#39;t express a strong opinion about where it stops&quot;, while the supply curve has been &quot;going down&quot; in the sense that staking has become more accessbile and de-risked, leading to a higher amount of ETH staked for the same amount of yield. Problems with a high % of ETH staked include low real yield despite nominally being ~2%, reliance on MEV/restaking to turn a profit, LSTs benefiting from increased economies of scale and improved &quot;moneyness&quot; compared to ETH, and a higher risk of a &quot;too big to fail&quot; NO creating a difficult slashing situation. Christine&#39;s main criticism is that while these are all problems, it&#39;s not clear that they&#39;re caused by high ETH stake % and can&#39;t be mitigated through other changes--would they really go away with lower stake totals?</li>\n<li>Justin Drake of the EF painted an optimistic picture of the Execution Auction future. Under Execution Auctions, proposal rights for slot n+63 are auctioned off during slot n, and ILs become fairly mandatory for giving proposers some censorship resistance power over the winning proposer. With EAs (or other APS) the effects of timing games, MEV spikes, proposer commitments, and any other overloading of Ethereum proposer duties get moved out of the hands of proposers to more specialized actors, and the additional value the proposers earn from the extra duties largely end up burned. I was surprised to see that so few people in the audience knew of the concept, so glad it got presented. Though I will mention that while the benefits are there as listed, the devil is really in the details and there are some serious issues remaining to work out.</li>\n<li>Will Shannon of Lido talked about Lido&#39;s progress in decentralizing their validator set. They&#39;re very proud of their NO diversity and transparency. The DVT module currently represents 0.5% of Lido stake, but recently <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xaca2da3c932542e030db8bf5b6e4420bf4aa98bd57bd62b9b8008a4b7398abb2\">a DAO vote</a> approved an increase to 4%. Today there are 180 &quot;independent NOs&quot; participating (70% identified as &quot;solo or community&quot; validators), with 55 more in the pipeline to be added, with an expectation of reaching 300+ this year. The Community Staking Module is coming soon and is aimed to onboard 5000 independent NOs. They claim to have the best UX and bonding curve. Generally good to see dual governance and a wider validator set take off though--<a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x10abedcc563b66b1adee60825e78c387105110fa4a1e7354ab57bc9cc1e675c2\"><em>cough</em></a> sorry <a href=\"https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590#goal-3-steth-is-the-most-used-token-in-the-ethereum-ecosystem-13\"><em>cough</em></a> sorry.</li>\n<li>Glovin of Heroglyphs provided a pretty high level overview of the project. They think about the different phases of the token distribution lifecycle, and see heroglyphs as specifically a distribution layer aiming to be maximally fair by allowing tokens to be mined only by complete validators via custom block graffiti. I was hoping for a little more details about the complex systems they&#39;ve set up for genesis NFTs, validator IDs, badges, tokens, blah blah blah. Because I get the concept (and have my reservations) but haven&#39;t done a deep dive into the complex system they&#39;ve built on top of it.</li>\n<li>liftlines of Nimbus talked about what they&#39;re working on, specifically highlighting their four different clients. The first is obviously their consensus and validator client, which he emphasized has a somewhat-unique feature of being able to connect to multiple other clients (VC -&gt; (BN1 + BN2), and BN -&gt; (EL1 + EL2)). Their verified web3 proxy is a light client that runs on phones which can request and verify Ethereum state in place of a centralized RPC. They&#39;re working on an EL client, which they intend to be lightweight and will be available as a standalone binary or combined EL+CL binary. Their Portal Network client, Fluffy, will allow retrieval of historical state and will be tightly coupled with their other clients.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Back to side events the next few days.

I arrived on Saturday morning, and survived the immigration line whose length has become a bit of a meme here. Spent the rest of that day wandering around Brussels, seeing the old town sights. Before leaving, I asked a number of people for suggestions on what I should see in Brussels, and they all consistently told me that it's not a particularly interesting city. And sure, when [Manneken Pis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manneken_Pis) is considered the biggest attraction it makes me a little skeptical. But in the end it seems like a pleasant enough European city with enough interesting architecture, history, and parks to satisfy a day's wandering.\n\nToday--actually yesterday, had to buy another travel power adapter this morning so had my writeup delayed--EthCC hasn't officially started yet but the side events are already moving. [\"Sequencing x CAKE Day\"](https://lu.ma/sequence-cake-ethcc) was an all-day event hosted by Espresso Systems and Frontier Research. I'll admit I never learned what CAKE actually stands for, but [just looked it up now so here's a link](https://frontier.tech/the-cake-framework). And while sequencing is potentially an interesting topic, the buried lede here is that the topic everyone is actually excited about is [*based* sequencing](https://ethresear.ch/t/based-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-sequencing/15016). Related is the idea of *preconfirmations*, or simply *preconfs*, where the next proposer makes certain promises or commitments about the block they intend to produce, ranging from L1 tx inclusion to based L2 tx inclusion to various forms of execution guarantees.\n\nThere was plenty of time for socializing at the event, but also a string of talks:\n\n* Justin Drake of the EF opened with a talk on why synchrony is valuable. For context, this is part of what based sequencing would theoretically enable. Instead of sequentionally (asychronously) sending ETH to a rollup, buying an NFT, and sending the NFT back to L1, you send one mega-tx that accomplishes it all at the same time. Justin argues that this sychrony makes for better UX and DevX, while also improving data compression and proof aggregation. Real-time (SNARK) proving is an important requirement for true synchrony but we may be able to \"fake it till we make it\" using multisigs and SGX enclaves.\n* Ed Felten of Offchain Labs gave an overview of Arbitrum's proposed *Timeboost* scheduling algorithm. On many L2's, scheduling is a completely separate step from execution, data management, and proving; sequencing is *only* about determining an order for a set of transactions. Arbitrum currently uses FCFS, which has a lot of nice UX properties but it 1) doesn't internalize MEV and 2) isn't decentralized. People looking to capture MEV engage in latency races to see who can get in their frontrunning and arbitrage transactions first. In Timeboost, every minute an auction is held, and the winner gets access to a \"fast lane\" where their transactions are included more quickly, while everyone else's face a 200 ms delay. So the buyer of fast lane rights will have the power to capture all the MEV, but will give up most of the value in bidding in the auction. Ed also described a decentralized version of Timeboost.\n* dmarz of Flashbots is thinking about how to apply trusted execution environments (TEEs) for sequencing. He showed how in the Optimism chain interoperability design, there is a potential griefing attack if different entities are building the blocks for each chain. TEEs could enforce certain behavior to prevent these sorts of griefing attacks. Also an interesting mention of [Solana shreds](https://jito-labs.gitbook.io/mev/searcher-services/shredstream) as a model to learn about.\n* Benedikt Buenz of Espresso talked about Espresso's sequencing marketplace. Participating rollups would all auction off their sequencing rights at the same time, each potentially setting a minimum \"reserve price\". Bidders can bid on rollups individually or put in bids containing a combination of rollups, where generally the right to sequence rollups A+B is greater than the sum of the rights to sequence A and B separately (since you can capture cross-chain MEV). Espresso runs a combinatorial auction to determine the result.\n* Karthik Srinivasan of Sorella Labs had an interesting talk about sovereign systems. He defined *Attributable Apps* as those where the system itself can determing which parties receive auction proceeds (you could say they internalize their own MEV). *Sovereign Apps* are those which lock their state in such a way that they're not atomically composable with other apps, and thus determine their own ordering. Sovereign but *un*attributable apps incentivize fairer apps to be built on top, while attributable but *un*sovereign apps leak value to other apps via composability. But when there's both, they think there are some good properties.\n* Drew Van der Werff covered Commit-Boost, which is a standardized sidecar platform for proposer commitment modules. If proposers soon gain the ability to make certain commitments about the blocks they produce, it would be good to have the protocols for those commitments all live in one place with some standardized interfaces, rather than telling node operators to separately manage a dozen different mev-boost-like pieces of software. Still early in the design phase though.\n* There was a panel on based rollups consisting of Joe Andrews (Aztec), Brecht (Taiko), and Marek (Celo), with Justin Drake moderating. A poll of the audience found about 50% raised their hands when asked if they were \"bullish on based\". The panelists are looking for different benefits from going based, including inheriting L1 liveness, gaining composability and censorship resistance, and general simplicity. Panelists also highlighted the need for more blob space and either shorter block times or preconfirmations.\n* There was another panel on synchronous vs asynchronous composability, consisting of Lumi (zkSync), Jordi Baylina (Polygon), Ye Zhang (Scroll), Bryan Pellegrino (LayerZero), and Justin Drake (EF), with Ben Fisch moderating. The general sentiment was that while sycnhronous composability is absolutely a good thing, asyncronous composability may be easier to build out and may be almost as good. Aside from flash loans there's no real need for synchrony, it's just nice to have, with panelists disagreeing on exactly how nice.\n* I attended a workshop on commit-boost, which unfortunately got caught up in semantics and wasn't particularly productive, and got caught up in chats afterwards that caused me to miss a Vitalik talk on why and how to move to shorter block times. If somehow anyone here caught that talk, I'd appreciate a summary.\n\nThere were a few more talks I caught parts of, but I was kinda pooped so I'll leave it at that. I followed that up with a sequencing event held over dinner, good for socializing but oh wow I got mega pooped. Onward to the main conference next.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>EthCC Day 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m in Brussels for EthCC!

And sure, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manneken_Pis\">Manneken Pis</a> is considered the biggest attraction it makes me a little skeptical. But in the end it seems like a pleasant enough European city with enough interesting architecture, history, and parks to satisfy a day&#39;s wandering.</p>\n\n<p>Today--actually yesterday, had to buy another travel power adapter this morning so had my writeup delayed--EthCC hasn&#39;t officially started yet but the side events are already moving. <a href=\"https://lu.ma/sequence-cake-ethcc\">&quot;Sequencing x CAKE Day&quot;</a> was an all-day event hosted by Espresso Systems and Frontier Research. I&#39;ll admit I never learned what CAKE actually stands for, but <a href=\"https://frontier.tech/the-cake-framework\">just looked it up now so here&#39;s a link</a>. And while sequencing is potentially an interesting topic, the buried lede here is that the topic everyone is actually excited about is <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/based-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-sequencing/15016\"><em>based</em> sequencing</a>. Related is the idea of <em>preconfirmations</em>, or simply <em>preconfs</em>, where the next proposer makes certain promises or commitments about the block they intend to produce, ranging from L1 tx inclusion to based L2 tx inclusion to various forms of execution guarantees.</p>\n\n<p>There was plenty of time for socializing at the event, but also a string of talks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Justin Drake of the EF opened with a talk on why synchrony is valuable. For context, this is part of what based sequencing would theoretically enable. Instead of sequentionally (asychronously) sending ETH to a rollup, buying an NFT, and sending the NFT back to L1, you send one mega-tx that accomplishes it all at the same time. Justin argues that this sychrony makes for better UX and DevX, while also improving data compression and proof aggregation. Real-time (SNARK) proving is an important requirement for true synchrony but we may be able to &quot;fake it till we make it&quot; using multisigs and SGX enclaves.</li>\n<li>Ed Felten of Offchain Labs gave an overview of Arbitrum&#39;s proposed <em>Timeboost</em> scheduling algorithm. On many L2&#39;s, scheduling is a completely separate step from execution, data management, and proving; sequencing is <em>only</em> about determining an order for a set of transactions. Arbitrum currently uses FCFS, which has a lot of nice UX properties but it 1) doesn&#39;t internalize MEV and 2) isn&#39;t decentralized. People looking to capture MEV engage in latency races to see who can get in their frontrunning and arbitrage transactions first. In Timeboost, every minute an auction is held, and the winner gets access to a &quot;fast lane&quot; where their transactions are included more quickly, while everyone else&#39;s face a 200 ms delay. So the buyer of fast lane rights will have the power to capture all the MEV, but will give up most of the value in bidding in the auction. Ed also described a decentralized version of Timeboost.</li>\n<li>dmarz of Flashbots is thinking about how to apply trusted execution environments (TEEs) for sequencing. He showed how in the Optimism chain interoperability design, there is a potential griefing attack if different entities are building the blocks for each chain. TEEs could enforce certain behavior to prevent these sorts of griefing attacks. Also an interesting mention of <a href=\"https://jito-labs.gitbook.io/mev/searcher-services/shredstream\">Solana shreds</a> as a model to learn about.</li>\n<li>Benedikt Buenz of Espresso talked about Espresso&#39;s sequencing marketplace. Participating rollups would all auction off their sequencing rights at the same time, each potentially setting a minimum &quot;reserve price&quot;. Bidders can bid on rollups individually or put in bids containing a combination of rollups, where generally the right to sequence rollups A+B is greater than the sum of the rights to sequence A and B separately (since you can capture cross-chain MEV). Espresso runs a combinatorial auction to determine the result.</li>\n<li>Karthik Srinivasan of Sorella Labs had an interesting talk about sovereign systems. He defined <em>Attributable Apps</em> as those where the system itself can determing which parties receive auction proceeds (you could say they internalize their own MEV). <em>Sovereign Apps</em> are those which lock their state in such a way that they&#39;re not atomically composable with other apps, and thus determine their own ordering. Sovereign but <em>un</em>attributable apps incentivize fairer apps to be built on top, while attributable but <em>un</em>sovereign apps leak value to other apps via composability. But when there&#39;s both, they think there are some good properties.</li>\n<li>Drew Van der Werff covered Commit-Boost, which is a standardized sidecar platform for proposer commitment modules. If proposers soon gain the ability to make certain commitments about the blocks they produce, it would be good to have the protocols for those commitments all live in one place with some standardized interfaces, rather than telling node operators to separately manage a dozen different mev-boost-like pieces of software. Still early in the design phase though.</li>\n<li>There was a panel on based rollups consisting of Joe Andrews (Aztec), Brecht (Taiko), and Marek (Celo), with Justin Drake moderating. A poll of the audience found about 50% raised their hands when asked if they were &quot;bullish on based&quot;. The panelists are looking for different benefits from going based, including inheriting L1 liveness, gaining composability and censorship resistance, and general simplicity. Panelists also highlighted the need for more blob space and either shorter block times or preconfirmations.</li>\n<li>There was another panel on synchronous vs asynchronous composability, consisting of Lumi (zkSync), Jordi Baylina (Polygon), Ye Zhang (Scroll), Bryan Pellegrino (LayerZero), and Justin Drake (EF), with Ben Fisch moderating. The general sentiment was that while sycnhronous composability is absolutely a good thing, asyncronous composability may be easier to build out and may be almost as good. Aside from flash loans there&#39;s no real need for synchrony, it&#39;s just nice to have, with panelists disagreeing on exactly how nice.</li>\n<li>I attended a workshop on commit-boost, which unfortunately got caught up in semantics and wasn&#39;t particularly productive, and got caught up in chats afterwards that caused me to miss a Vitalik talk on why and how to move to shorter block times. If somehow anyone here caught that talk, I&#39;d appreciate a summary.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There were a few more talks I caught parts of, but I was kinda pooped so I&#39;ll leave it at that. I followed that up with a sequencing event held over dinner, good for socializing but oh wow I got mega pooped. Onward to the main conference next.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-08 13:25:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lc8wah6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dy0lbc","parent_id":"t3_1dy0lbc","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/the-A-word","body":"Thank you for another amazingly thorough write-up for those who could not attend.

I heard about it after Anthony Sassano mentioned it at the end of one of the recent Daily Gwei episodes. It is founded by Kain from Synthetix who I consider one of the more respected builders in the space. I've largely been slowing down on airdrop farming, but with no points system and it merely being a cross-chain account abstracted wallet I decided I was happy to give it a go.\n\nIn place of a points system, they are doing something they're calling Craterun. They're giving out what are effectively lootboxes over a 5 week period which started a couple of weeks ago. With 5 million crates in total, that means that 3 million are still to go out and they contain things like NFTs and boosts to get more crates. It's basically just a more innovative points system. Nothing groundbreaking really, just a refreshing dopamine hit for degens. The goal would be to get one of the 1,000 Infinex Patron NFTs as they will no doubt be rewarded in an inevitable airdrop. Speaking of which, they aim to be different to the current distribution model where the community gets a tiny slice of the drop by actually distributing a majority of the tokens to the community.\n\nWhat is more interesting is the account abstracted wallet. It's basically a smart contract wallet on multiple chains, currently including Ethereum, Solana (eew), and a handful of Ethereum L2s including Arbitrum, Optimism and Base. It uses (surprise surprise) passkeys. I personally have mixed feelings about passkeys but they are probably the best option for account abstraction for the masses at this point. Overall it's just a relatively newbie friendly wallet, which probably isn't what many here are after, but regardless, I will always jump on an opportunity to farm some airdrops for merely depositing funds I wasn't already farming something with.\n\nRemember to always look out for scams and make sure you understand a platform before you ape in any funds. Please don't ape in just because I said so and because it was mentioned on the daily gwei. Take your time to think before using something new. There is no rush. If you do join, you'll get a 5% bonus towards crates using anybody's referral and the referrer gets a 15% bonus. [As per the referral code rules we voted on for the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1agzn4m?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=ethfinance&utm_content=t3_1agzn4m), here is my referral code: https://app.infinex.xyz?r=35JBBJJJ\n\nAlso, quick rant, it says you have to stake tokens to participate in the Craterun. It's not really staking. You're just making said funds eligible for the crate drops. I don't think their website made this clear which I find very frustrating. Can we please not call things which aren't actually staking staking? K. Thanks. Bye.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m surprised that <a href=\"https://infinex.xyz/\">Infinex</a> has not been mentioned yet here. I heard about it after Anthony Sassano mentioned it at the end of one of the recent Daily Gwei episodes. It is founded by Kain from Synthetix who I consider one of the more respected builders in the space. I&#39;ve largely been slowing down on airdrop farming, but with no points system and it merely being a cross-chain account abstracted wallet I decided I was happy to give it a go.</p>\n\n<p>In place of a points system, they are doing something they&#39;re calling Craterun. They&#39;re giving out what are effectively lootboxes over a 5 week period which started a couple of weeks ago. With 5 million crates in total, that means that 3 million are still to go out and they contain things like NFTs and boosts to get more crates. It&#39;s basically just a more innovative points system. Nothing groundbreaking really, just a refreshing dopamine hit for degens. The goal would be to get one of the 1,000 Infinex Patron NFTs as they will no doubt be rewarded in an inevitable airdrop. Speaking of which, they aim to be different to the current distribution model where the community gets a tiny slice of the drop by actually distributing a majority of the tokens to the community.</p>\n\n<p>What is more interesting is the account abstracted wallet. It&#39;s basically a smart contract wallet on multiple chains, currently including Ethereum, Solana (eew), and a handful of Ethereum L2s including Arbitrum, Optimism and Base. It uses (surprise surprise) passkeys. I personally have mixed feelings about passkeys but they are probably the best option for account abstraction for the masses at this point. Overall it&#39;s just a relatively newbie friendly wallet, which probably isn&#39;t what many here are after, but regardless, I will always jump on an opportunity to farm some airdrops for merely depositing funds I wasn&#39;t already farming something with.</p>\n\n<p>Remember to always look out for scams and make sure you understand a platform before you ape in any funds. Please don&#39;t ape in just because I said so and because it was mentioned on the daily gwei. Take your time to think before using something new. There is no rush. If you do join, you&#39;ll get a 5% bonus towards crates using anybody&#39;s referral and the referrer gets a 15% bonus. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/1agzn4m?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=ethfinance&amp;utm_content=t3_1agzn4m\">As per the referral code rules we voted on for the subreddit</a>, here is my referral code: <a href=\"https://app.infinex.xyz?r=35JBBJJJ\">https://app.infinex.xyz?r=35JBBJJJ</a></p>\n\n<p>Also, quick rant, it says you have to stake tokens to participate in the Craterun. It&#39;s not really staking. You&#39;re just making said funds eligible for the crate drops. I don&#39;t think their website made this clear which I find very frustrating. Can we please not call things which aren&#39;t actually staking staking? K. Thanks.

My ETH profits aren't nearly enough to retire on, but they did cover most of our house down payment so I think that counts as \"life changing\".

Here's a prediction (and please note that my predictions are usually wrong, so just see them as a starter for a discussion and the correct answer to when L2 season starts :))\n\nTo start some observations: Both next gen alt L1s and L2s are worth billions, but are down only vs ETH or BTC. Last cycle there were some alt L1s that had a huge run (the famous SOLUNAVAX trade) and at least temporarily outperformed ETH and BTC. \n\nSo what made those runs possible? And what's missing today?\n\nI think the missing ingredient is... high fees on ETH mainnet. There are high fees on L1 when there's a lot of demand for block space. Apparently the demand is not there right now (2-5 gwei gas for days or even weeks). Why is that? Crypto natives that caused ETH congestion last bull market are not mostly living on L2s (both for regular usage, but also farming stuff). And there are so many L2s + blobs that even with a lot of people living on L2s the fees usually don't go up (exception: Base some weeks ago). In other words: what we are seeing now probably is \"crypto native L2 season\". But for e.g. L2 tokens to go up, we need more than that. \n\nWe need new users that start on L1 and slowly lead to higher fees. Only when ETH is \"unusable\", new users will be pushed to L2s... which will lead to L2 season. Similar to end of 2021, beginning of 2022 when high fees on mainnet lead to alt L1 season. \n\nNew users usually arrive late in the cycle, when ETH has already gone up, media is picking it up. The ETF could be a pretty good catalyst to start this. This obviously also means that if there is a layer 2 season, it will likely be late this cycle. And my guess is that only a few L2s will really profit, but those could then crash all other tokens. The good thing is: this could even lead to L2s going up after ETH and BTC have peaked. \n\ntl;dr: L2 season will happen late in the cycle, L2 tokens likely won't go up anytime soon. But then they might have a great run. \n\nP.S. If an app leads to L2 usage, that's imo a sign for \"app season\", and has nothing to do with the L2 itself. L2 season for me means, that L2s offer you everything you wanna do on L1, but with lower fees. \n\nP.S. 2: But Benido, some L2s were around when SOLUNAVAX mooned!? Yes, but back then L2s were still in their infancy and seen as unsecure, infra (blobs, smart contract wallets, CEX integrations etc.) was missing, fees were still high (and higher than alt L1s).
