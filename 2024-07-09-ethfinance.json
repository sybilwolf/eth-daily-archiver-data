Started off with [Beyond the Block II](https://lu.ma/a57wgqtz), hosted by the Gattaca/Titan team. After lunch I headed over to the Obol + Lido + Liquid Collective's [\"Don't Forget About Security and Decentralization Day\"](https://lu.ma/c914mjy5). Not much else to say, just listened to talks, chatted with some folks, and probably ate more than my fair share of the free snacks.\n\nBeyond The Block:\n\n* Swapnil Raj of Nethermind gave a talk on the concept of Appointed Execution Proposers, [described here](https://ethresear.ch/t/appointed-execution-proposers-because-the-proposer-you-know/19284). Basically, given some sort of market for execution block proposal rights (ETs, EAs, etc), this suggests that the only entities that can participate in that market are those who are voted in by the validator set. If a block proposer does something Bad\u2122 (think multi-slot MEV or monopolistic behavior), the validator set could adjust their votes to kick them out of the proposer set. It's vague, but deliberately so. I'm hesitant because I find explicit on-chain governance and permissioned actors to be kind of opposed to Ethereum's values.\n* Drew Van Der Werff gave a good talk explaining the vision of block builders as \"polishers\" or \"shiners\" of blocks. This isn't a new idea, but this talk put it together fairly cohesively. In the proposed future, proposers would provide \"templates\" on how to build blocks, possibly inclusion lists, partial block auctions, requirements that blocks should be ordered by priority fee, have oracle updates at the top of the block, exclude sandwiches, and so on. The concerns are that there could be fragmentation (many different protocols and sidecars to do this same thing) and developer complexity, so that's where commit-boost could come in to provide some standardization.\n* Justin Drake of the EF (yes, this guy again) gave another pitch about preconfirmations, referring to them as \"wholesome\". The framing this time was interesting: looking at \"ticks\" as subdivisions of slot time, and \"shreds\" as subunits of block contents. Other than that it was mostly the same pitch I've heard before, with L1 being a Schelling point as a shared sequencer, whose main problem of slow slot times can be solved via preconfirmations issued over shorter ticks producing a stream of constraints on block production that more resemble continuous block production while still keeping the base L1 consensus simple.\n* Terence Tsao of Prysm / Offchain Labs talked about the pipelining of consensus and execution blocks. This is a sort of side effect of the Proposer Timeliness Committee (PTC) design, recently given the designation [EIP-7732](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7732.md)! Under Ethereum today, with validators and relays playing intense timing games, most CL and EL block transition computation must take place in less than one second. That includes consensus and execution state transitions, blob DA checks, and fork choice update. But with PTC, the consensus block is released in the first half of the slot and the execution block is released in the second half, allowing for a better distribution of computational effort. Terence suggested that, even under aggressive timing games, there would be 1s to verify the CL block, 3s to verify the builder's release of the EL block, 6-9s to verify the EL block itself, and 9-12s to verify blob DA.\n\nSecurity and Decentralization Day was all panels, which I tend to not find quite as interesting. Solo talks give someone a chance to give a rehearsed presentation of new work, panels just get people's opinions on information that's already out there. Which can be useful, especially with smart panelists, but in general there's no shortage of opinions. Anyway, let's check the notes to see if anything stood out...\n\n* Thomas Heremans, CEO of the Obol Association, did actually give one opening talk to get us started. So just a quick update on Obol: they have 175+ operators over 35 countries, with [Charon v1.0 recently released](https://blog.obol.org/releasing-charon-1-0/). The [Obol Collective](https://blog.obol.org/announcing-the-obol-collective/) is also newly created, which is a governance layer which, among other things, directs a portion of captured fees through retroactive funding to support ecosystem projects.\n* There was a panel on correlated staking risks, with Joe Andrews (Aztec), Melissa Nelson (Alluvial), Oisin Kyne (DV Labs), moderated by Terence Tsao (Offchain Labs). \"Correlated risk\" is not just bugs in ETH clients, but could also refer to usage of AWS/Azure as a source of correlated staking failures. Important mitigations are dashboards and data, along with coordinated education about the risks. On the roadmap wishlist is primarily ILs and correlated liveness penalties. Current worries (which maybe strayed from the topic a bit to just generally what's scary about Ethereum now) are issuance curve changes, timing games, builder centralization, and opaque ETH governance.\n* A panel on institutional staking with Mara Schmiedt (Alluvial), acdv (Lido), Lewis Han (Coinbase), and moderator Viktor Bunin (Credibly Neutral). ETH ETFs approved in the US do not permit staking, but elsewhere around the world regulators often started the same way before eventually permitting staking later, so the perception is it's only a matter of time. Apparently the US has a \"t+1\" redempion requirement which means that issuers will have to keep a large amount unstaked and liquid, big space for them to compete on strategy. The panel was split on whether ETF inflows are a risk to Ethereum decentralization: acdv is worried about the massive amount of money that will flow in and the \"soft pressure\" that could be felt as a result, while the others are excited for crypto to go mainstream and think ETH is sufficiently well distributed that even with ETFs there won't be massive concentration of power.\n* A home stakers panel with Pol Lanski (Dappnode), Izzy (Lido), GLCstaked (stakecat), and moderator Anthony Bertolino (DV Labs). Panelists agreed staking education is actually top notch, but note that the messaging for \"why run your own validator\" is not as strong, and education is too targeted towards privileged audiences (in English, assumes good internet, etc). Lanski thinks issuance reduction makes sense *only if* paired with other measures to ensure home staker viability. Izzy thinks we're not onboarding enough new home stakers, though [stakecat's report](https://www.stakecat.space/blog/solo-stakers-arent-going-away) is more optimistic. Mixed feelings about MAX_EB change, generally all in favor but think it could be more solo staker friendly: did you know that the custom ceiling option was dropped a while back so all partial withdrawals will be manual and cost you gas?\n* Eh, a couple other panels but nothing particularly notable for me.\n\nI'll also throw in [this new ethresear.ch post](https://ethresear.ch/t/deep-diving-attestations-a-quantitative-analysis/20020) by Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter which I've been anticipating for a bit. Lots of good data in there but very interestingly, some analysis on *attester timing games*. It seems there are multiple different strategies for attestation timing that are viable for achieving high performance. Also found 139 validators that were offline over the entire analyzed 4-week period, many of which can be [identified as solo and rocket pool stakers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WChTqYlDjtI).\n\nLet's see, what do I have tomorrow... Ah yes, another MEV side event. When I first started documenting my first ETHDenver, I was able to get pretty general coverage of the whole Ethereum space, but as I've specialized it's clearly been reflected in the talks I attend and the topics I write about. I'm afraid that's just how it is now. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>EthCC Day 3</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dy0lbc/daily_general_discussion_july_8_2024/lc8wnnd/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Side event day today.
