My notes say (but I wouldn't be able to explain much further): There is a welfare loss among liquidity providers that scales linearly with the number of LPs.

With today's just-in-time auctions, if a small builder has an advantage for a given slot, they should be able to win it and pay the second price, as usual. But under the ahead-of-time Execution Auction model, builders will be bidding based on their expected value of the future block. The top builder will always have the highest EV, and their best strategy is to win ALL the auctions, and resell to smaller builders JIT as needed. But the top builder, having monopolistic power, will be able to take advantage of their position to get better deals out of JIT resale. So ultimately it leads to even further centralization.\n* The first debate was on app-specific sequencing vs app-chains. App-specific sequencing refers to an app mandating that all of its transactions for a block have a sequencer package them into a single bundle, which gives the protocol control over ordering and MEV. Panelists in favor of that approach like that you get some degree of control while staying within a larger ecosystem and maintaining composability. App-specific chains are actually separate blockchains per app, and give maximum sovereignty in exchange for needing to build more surrounding infra (validator set, indexer, oracles). The lines between them can sometimes be blurry, panel suggested that the main difference is who you end up paying gas to.\n* The other debate I listened to was on preconfirmations, with 9 people up on stage! Those in favor argued that preconfs provide generally better UX, that commitments to blobs can help with their timely propagation, and that based rollups with shared sequencing and fast confirmations are cool and good. Those who were more skeptical thought that a lot of the problems preconfs look to solve would be better fixed by having L2s actually improve and decentralize their sequencers, and our energy would be better spent elsewhere rather than bending over backwards for L2s that don't need (or maybe even want) to go based. Additional debate around how much demand there will be for inclusion (as opposed to *execution*) preconfs, how much of an issue it is that preconfers are incentivized to issue preconfs as late as possible, and whether convincing rollups to go based makes it harder for them to later spin off into their own L1 instead.\n\nI guess it was a little shorter of a day than usual, with the panels being particularly lengthy and difficult to summarize into my usual target word count. Hope the broader summaries are still useful.\n\nTomorrow I'm back to the main event finally. Primarily I should be hanging out at the [ethmagicians track on the street fighter stage](https://x.com/casparschwa/status/1811068255710085234). It'll be going from 10:00-16:15, so most of the day. If you look closely, you'll also see: I'm actually on the MEV and ePBS panel/townhall at 13:00! I'll be up there with representatives from the Flashbots, Ultrasound, and Titan relays (and others), so relays are arguably over-represented and I hope I'll be able to contribute a little bit.

That&#39;s what I brushed under the &quot;US political quirks&quot;. There is a few others, like being a bi-party system, requiring a lot of money to be able to run a campaign, and many others I probably have no clue about.</p>\n\n<p>But I&#39;m fairly ignorant about this. I can only point out how remarkable it is that the last 30 years of US presidents have been dominated by people born in a very tight range. And that the most likely explanation is that that choice was driven by the largest demographic group voting for them. As they have become older, the candidates became older with them. They are the epitome of a figure of authority for a US boomer.</p>\n\n<p>There is probably a bit of self-selection bias. The parties are likely selecting candidates in that range too, as they know they have greater chance of winning an election if they present a candidate in that age range.</p>\n\n<p>My suspicion/prediction is that all this will come to an end soonish, in the next 5-10 years. Millenials will be very soon be the dominant demographic: <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/296974/us-population-share-by-generation/\">https://www.statista.com/statistics/296974/us-population-share-by-generation/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-10 08:25:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lciuzkq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dzng6z","parent_id":"t1_lcimq6i","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/15kisFUD","body":"I hope you are right in your prediction!
