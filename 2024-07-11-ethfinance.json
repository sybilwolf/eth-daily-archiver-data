Each one lasted 45 minutes to an hour, so these were fairly beefy discussions. The venue otherwise seemed somewhat quieter than when I last checked in on Monday. Still plenty of people running around, even bumped into Vitalik at a drink station, but a little calmer day. Was able to get lunch at the food court in the basement too; on Monday they actually ran out of food but today things seemed to be running smoothly.\n\n* Panel on issuance, centered around Caspar and Ansgar's analysis. The central question came down to the distribution of stake at low and high percentages of total ETH staked: do big LSTs dominate more at 25% ETH staked or 80%? Some debate around how important PoS security is to the discussion (the [\"maximum viable security\"](https://ethresear.ch/t/maximum-viable-security-a-new-framing-for-ethereum-issuance/19992) argument): do we want more stake for more security, or do we already have enough stake such that attackers would find it cheaper to attack Ethereum through other vectors? Other topics generally discussed: is solo staker capital exhausted, are some entities staking user funds without realizing the risk, rainbow staking, enshrined LSTs, faster exits, and staking penalty caps.\n* Panel on client development and testing, here's an assortment of topics. A couple reth people up there who said they felt well supported by the other client teams as they've worked through problems. Geth and Prysm both have a lot of old legacy features which are hard to maintain but still have a small number of users who complain if they get deprecated and removed. Core dev governance needs to be a little fuzzy, because if you start establishing hard rules like \"you have to have a client with this much market share to get a vote\" the system becomes easy to capture. Testing around mev-boost has gotten better, and while testing used to be focused on the in-protocol behavior, mev-boost testing is now internalized to some extent. Though unclear who should be ultimately responsible for maintenance.\n* Panel on MEV. I was on this panel, topics were mostly about MEV as it relates to the protocol and Eth clients, and we largely stayed on track. Some continuation of the discussion about who has responsibility for mev-boost development and maintenance, some talk about relay competitiveness, some talk about a certain unspecified relay that has had issues causing missed slots and potentially not providing sufficient transparency into what went wrong. Maybe harder for me to provide a full summary since I wasn't taking notes.\n* Panel on L1 and L2 standards. This was my first time hearing about [Rollup Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs), or RIPs, so a bit of an overview. These are *optional* standards for how to implement something on a rollup, generally some rollup will implement a feature (e.g. a new precompile), and document what they've done as an RIP, potentially getting broader feedback on the design and iterating a few times. Then if another rollup wants to implement the same feature, they are encouraged to follow the same design, leading to consistency and standardization. Some talk about using RIPs as an experimentation platform for EIPs, especially if the L2 is running as a geth fork anyway, makes it easy to try it out on L1 later. L2s would like core devs to participate in discussions around RIPs, though the core devs would rather have the L2 devs attend ACD calls to get experience they could bring back to RIP/RollCall.\n* Panel on account abstraction. To be honest I got smacked in the face with a sudden wave of burnout before this panel started and considered not going at all, but ended up sitting in while only paying half attention. But from what I picked up, there are a couple big proposals being considered now. [EIP-7702](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7702.md) empowers EOAs to temporarily set smart contract code for themselves that can be executed only for the duration of the transaction. Letting EOAs temporarily become smart accounts may help address the chicken-and-egg problem of getting account abstraction off the ground. [RIP-7560](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7560.md) is a standard for L2s that would enshrine a form of native account abstraction for those who participate.\n\nOn the MEV panel, I spoke up a few times, honestly kind of skeptical that I contributed much of value but fine whatever. When I'm giving a talk I tend to enter a kind of zen state where I just start speaking and trust that my background knowledge and practice will help me make sense in the end. Actually felt like that a little on the panel too, usually I am very hesitant to express opinions, but apparently if you put me up in front of a crowd it actually *lowers* my inhibitions. Kind of funny.\n\nAnyway, I suppose that wraps up this conference. I'm actually sticking around for a few more days because one group organized a little event on Saturday that I should probably go to. I'm curious how the turnout is going to be, since it sounds like most people are heading home before then. That makes tomorrow a lazy day maybe doing laundry and sightseeing. And then, hmm, no major events until November I think? Staking Summit + Devcon + Hodlercon is going to be one heck of a trip though.\n\n---------\n\nSo, some final impressions on the conference then. Last year I heard EthCC leaned heavily towards side events, with many people foregoing main venue tickets entirely, and I think the same was true this year. I'm curious as to why that is. I wonder if the main conference isn't doing enough the meet the needs of attendees, or if we've reached a weird point where running your own side event with your brand name plastered on the advertising and creating scarcity in ticketing is just too valuable for marketing and there's nothing the main event could do to recapture that value. It makes scheduling more difficult, since these side events are scattered around town, have different levels of strictness for checking ticketing, and hopping between them takes some time commitment. Side events are probably good for getting like-minded people in the same place for networking, but I felt like I was missing some breadth.\n\nMy events of choice gave me a lot of exposure to discussion around PBS, APS, based sequencing, and preconfirmations. As usual, anything MEV-adjacent is a hot field of activiy and research, and there's always more to learn and catch up on. Today's account abstraction and RIP panels reminded me that there are whole other worlds of research that I'm just ignorant of, and it's *all* moving fast. One panelist at yesterday's event suggested that preconfirmations are out of Pandora's box at this point, and regardless of people's opinions on them, they will be happening one way or another, which I thought was slightly scary.\n\nI find my current stance to be that I'm a big fan of the broader visions: based rollups settling on an L1 optimized for proof verification, providing fantastic UX with continuous, censorship resistant block building via proposer commitments, ILs, and preconfs; APS and rainbow staking giving home and solo stakers a niche where they can excel and protecting the validator set from overloading; and account abstraction and fully realized intents solver networks finally replacing the clunky EOA transaction model with a good long-term viable user experience. But at the same time I am more aware than ever of the challenges that stand in the way of realizing those goals, many of which currently seem to have no good solutions. But as long as there remains continuous iteration on research with those goals kept closely in mind, I'm still optimistic we can get there.\n\nBrussels is a decent enough city, nothing particularly exciting but nice architecture in the old town and a reliable metro system. I'm not much of a city person in general, and once I get home I will probably need to go unwind in the mountains for a few days to get all the icky cityness out of my system. But no particular complaints about this city. I've heard the rest of Belgium is potentially more interesting, have some recommendations for places to visit in Antwerp and miiiight consider that for tomorrow since it's only an hour away by train.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>EthCC Day 5</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dzng6z/daily_general_discussion_july_10_2024/lcl4hwi/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Today I was at the main EthCC event, though instead of my usual hopping around between stages in pursuit of whatever looks the most interesting, I hung out at the series of <a href=\"https://x.com/casparschwa/status/1811068255710085234\">ethmagicians panels</a> on a number of topics. Each one lasted 45 minutes to an hour, so these were fairly beefy discussions. The venue otherwise seemed somewhat quieter than when I last checked in on Monday. Still plenty of people running around, even bumped into Vitalik at a drink station, but a little calmer day. Was able to get lunch at the food court in the basement too; on Monday they actually ran out of food but today things seemed to be running smoothly.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Panel on issuance, centered around Caspar and Ansgar&#39;s analysis. The central question came down to the distribution of stake at low and high percentages of total ETH staked: do big LSTs dominate more at 25% ETH staked or 80%? Some debate around how important PoS security is to the discussion (the <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/maximum-viable-security-a-new-framing-for-ethereum-issuance/19992\">&quot;maximum viable security&quot;</a> argument): do we want more stake for more security, or do we already have enough stake such that attackers would find it cheaper to attack Ethereum through other vectors? Other topics generally discussed: is solo staker capital exhausted, are some entities staking user funds without realizing the risk, rainbow staking, enshrined LSTs, faster exits, and staking penalty caps.</li>\n<li>Panel on client development and testing, here&#39;s an assortment of topics. A couple reth people up there who said they felt well supported by the other client teams as they&#39;ve worked through problems. Geth and Prysm both have a lot of old legacy features which are hard to maintain but still have a small number of users who complain if they get deprecated and removed. Core dev governance needs to be a little fuzzy, because if you start establishing hard rules like &quot;you have to have a client with this much market share to get a vote&quot; the system becomes easy to capture. Testing around mev-boost has gotten better, and while testing used to be focused on the in-protocol behavior, mev-boost testing is now internalized to some extent. Though unclear who should be ultimately responsible for maintenance.</li>\n<li>Panel on MEV. I was on this panel, topics were mostly about MEV as it relates to the protocol and Eth clients, and we largely stayed on track. Some continuation of the discussion about who has responsibility for mev-boost development and maintenance, some talk about relay competitiveness, some talk about a certain unspecified relay that has had issues causing missed slots and potentially not providing sufficient transparency into what went wrong. Maybe harder for me to provide a full summary since I wasn&#39;t taking notes.</li>\n<li>Panel on L1 and L2 standards. This was my first time hearing about <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs\">Rollup Improvement Proposals</a>, or RIPs, so a bit of an overview. These are <em>optional</em> standards for how to implement something on a rollup, generally some rollup will implement a feature (e.g. a new precompile), and document what they&#39;ve done as an RIP, potentially getting broader feedback on the design and iterating a few times.
