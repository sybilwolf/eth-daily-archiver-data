Ray is very interesting in this sense as it&#39;s removes the fiat fluctuations and leaves only the relative difference. The flippening will spark people to broaden their understanding. I think most underestimate the effects this will have. And the ETFs going live might just be the final needed trigger to get the ball rolling. CPI numbers pale in comparison.
