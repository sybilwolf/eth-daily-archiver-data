Maybe because they just [underestimate development time](https://warpcast.com/polynya/0x02c26100).\n\nRight now the sentiment is very strange: There seems to be \"infra-fatigue\" after endless and unlimited funding of infrastructure plays in the past years. There are a lot of new alt-L1s and L2s, bridges, developments in zk, DVT, you name it. At least right now there seems to be more block space than we need and the market seems to agree. Tokens that were hyped pre launch are now disappointing users and buyers. Some projects are even trading below their last private round valuation. At the same time we are still missing the last cycle's \"Uniswap moment\" and/ or defi summer. The amount of new apps is very limited. I think it's fair to point to social(fi) like Farcaster, Friends Dot Tech and Lens as a new category, but that's about it. Apparently investments into apps are also fairly limited, at least compared to infrastructure bets made by VCs.\u00a0\n\nSo why is that?\n\nAt least until now infrastructure investments have had a great return. Even projects that have launched their tokens in the past couple of weeks like zksync\u00a0have more or less tripled\u00a0their investors money (last private round was at a 1.25B valuation, now 3.6B FDV).

Yes, at some point we might run out of block space again, but now there is an abundance of it *and*\u00a0both ETH and L2s but also alt-L1s like SOL are still scaling, so the available blockspace in e.g. 2 years will be way higher than the one we can consume today. My gut feeling is that 2 (or 6) years ago a few thousand people were enough to fill every single block in ETH (or BTC in 2017/2018). I don't think that even millions of users will be enough to make that happen again across the board in 2025.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAdditionally if/ when tech at one point abstracts blockchains for users away and blockspace is a commodity the demand for coins might change drastically and the case for new layer 1/2/3s might be completely different.\u00a0\n\nDoes this mean investments will then go into apps?\u00a0\n\nFirst of all: I am not a VC, just a random guy on the internet, so my opinion is little informed and likely stupid. But there were some interesting opinions. One that really got me thinking was this question some asked:\u00a0\n\n>\"when did we *really*\u00a0see a new product in the past couple of years?\"\u00a0\n\nYes, TikTok is different from Snapchat which is not Facebook, but these are examples of incremental innovation. And even TikTok is more than 7 years old. In other words: How many *new*\u00a0apps are still possible?\u00a0\n\nIf your answer to that question is \"probably not a lot\", then what does it mean? This could mean that the use cases that were thought of at launch could be the best (and only?) use cases for blockchains. Maybe defi is the only (relevant/ big) use case ETH needs. Add to that a little social media, a little gaming and include prediction markets in defi et voila.\u00a0\n\nBut what does that mean for apps? It could mean that we will incrementally innovate on that front as well with a new incumbent every now and then, but the general categories are already set in stone and winners, at least for chain/ ecosystem, are already defined.\u00a0\n\nAnd what are applications at all? I guess a token is not really an application, but it is a product and I guess we can argue that tokenized (real world) assets are one of the biggest successes in crypto until now. USDT is printing money in this high rate environment. BUIDL\u00a0apparently is growing as well. It's just not the case that crypto natives are (directly) participating, but value is captured and it's not just pennies...\u00a0\n\nIf the thesis is that we will slowly replace traditional finance rails, then you are likely only waiting for three things:\u00a0\n\n- more people onchain\u00a0and an exploding market\n\n- startups and tradi to tokenize the world\n\n- regulation so that crypto native protocols can add a rev-share\n\nAt the same time the reality in this case is that (a part or maybe even the majority of) the value might be captured by crypto outsiders from tradfi.\u00a0","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>About 2 ago Liberosist said that &quot;the infrastructure play is dead, the value will be captured by apps&quot; (not verbatim).
