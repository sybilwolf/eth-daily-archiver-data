Some are just content with it, some are worried. A friend who&#39;s 34 just spends his days playing video games. Has no interest in a girlfriend or starting a family because his &quot;time is just too precious&quot; for him. So he spends his weekends, when he&#39;s not working, playing the newest video game that just came out. Dude is not even bad looking. Just a narcisist. But has no worries about the future. What would he like to be 50 or 60 and still being alone, no family or kids. However, he is the one that tries to advise me on how to be the best person I can be which is ironic since he doesn&#39;t have is life in order.</p>\n\n<p>Then I have a female friend who&#39;s 26, spent her entire life partying not really giving a fuck, now wants to find a good man, and can&#39;t. She&#39;s worried she&#39;s about having kids too late and what not. But just posted a video on Instagram, guess what is? A party she&#39;s in.</p>\n\n<p>I feel there&#39;s an increase in loneliness across all ages and people are aware of how bad it is but still decide to do the same shit over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>As for me, I&#39;ve been on the internet since 2005 and I&#39;m trying to move away from all this because I feel that there&#39;s no growth.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just waiting for ETH to reach a certain target so I can sell a bit and try to enjoy life not being glued to reddit. I care less and less about the next airdrop and how to chase it. It&#39;s a waste of time for me. I want to focus on people not on digital binary codes trying to exchange my real life for dopamine spikes that get me no where.</p>\n\n<p>Apologies for the rant.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-20 06:53:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"le2ybtb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1e7nt2y","parent_id":"t1_le2p7x2","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/yadude11","body":"Loved your last sentence.
