It's the way it is because the constraints you have to work with are so binding that it cannot be in many other ways if you want to maintain security, decentralization, credible neutrality, censorship resistance, scale to the serve the world needs, inherit those security properties on the upper layers of the financial world, etc...\n\nThese properties alone have lead us to PoS, EIP-1559 burn mechanism, the roll-up centric roadmap. These choices are a result of these constraints, and there really is very little leeway around it, as far as we know.\n\nIn much the same way Einstein's theory of relativity is not the way it is because scientists decided those were the equations.

Those requirements are binding enough to give you Einstein's field equations. \n\nThere are some higher order details that can be tuned in both General Relativity and Ethereum, but the core principles become rather constrained to the point there is a single theory that meets all those in the case of General Relativity.

We got lucky back in 2023 because the bugs were in minority clients and it only halted finality. A bug affecting the majority of clients might not happen now or even in the next decade, but there may be one day where another catastrophic event as damaging as [the 2016 DAO hack](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/09/coindesk-turns-10-how-the-dao-hack-changed-ethereum-and-crypto/) causes the chain to split again.\n\n---------------------\n\n##**Summary**\n\n> Historically, successful PoW attacks have been numerous, but successful PoS attacks are virtually non-existent.\n\nHistory has proven that **PoS** consensus is a more secure alternative to **PoW** consensus against Sybil attacks like the 51% attack. However, this is at the cost of PoS being less **resilient** than PoW for disaster recovery. This is because PoW by design allows for miners to re-attack/reorg the blockchain to revert mistakes.\n\nWhile client bugs are exceptionally rare, they do occur, and most PoS blockchains have no on-chain method to revert past finality. It's important to avoid reorgs in the first place because any transations that finalize off-chain through DEXs, bridges, and CEXs are often irreversible even after the blockchain is reverted.\n\n* **Security** is the ability to protect against malicious attackers\n* **Resilience** is the ability to restore the chain after an attack or catastrophic bug\n\nSimilar to the Blockchain Trilemma where there are trade offs between Security, Decentralization, and Scalability--**Resilience is also a tradeoff of Security**.\n\nEven the 2 biggest blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum (when it was still using PoW), have encountered 51% attacks.
