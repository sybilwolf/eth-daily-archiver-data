I was frustrated but knew I had my seed phrase stored and could recover when I returned home.\n\nI've recently bought my first house and moved in with my partner. In the confusion of moving 2 apartments into one, my recovery sheet and other old 2017 financial records were missing. I was feeling pretty despondent knowing that my carelessness and non-urgency about prepping for disaster recovery were starting to bite me in the ass. I fully believed that I lost access to my cold savings and minipools.\n\nIt's not like I couldn't afford my mortgage, but all hope I had for early financial independence were gone. That planned 2 year maternity leave, funded by ETH, for my pregnant partner wasn't financially feasible anymore.\n\nI did eventually find my ratty old college notebook with my Ledger seed phrase scrawled in the margins from 2017 when I originally set it up. The euphoria and relief on that day was enormous. I got lucky, I restored everything and have it all secured now. But I feel the need to share my near miss with others so that no one has to feel that rollercoaster of emotion going forward. I made plenty of mistakes to put myself in this situation.\n\nMy advice learnt from this; Setup an annual recovery method testing reminder. If you have a trusted partner, teach them about how to access things in the event you pass away. Keep your position records up to date, it also makes me less inclined to toss ETH into various flavours of the month that inevitably crash and burn.

The last chunk was on wallet security. These are cautionary phrases I've seen on risk management.\n\n**Don't Invest More Than You Can Afford to Lose**\n\nCrypto is full of amazing heights and soul-crushing lows. The fact that there have been multiple 90% drops and it is still the best performing asset class in the last decade is incredible. However, you can't always afford to ride it out. The crypto highs and lows tend to follow the macro highs and lows. So when crypto is low you're also jobless, economic opportunities are scarce, and you're scared. If you invest more than you can afford to lose when times are good, you could very well be one of the millions who find themselves selling while the market is down only to watch it do some crazy 30x the next cycle. Many of those people turn into crypto cynics and you will know them by the bitter tone every time crypto comes up on your Facebook feed or technology subreddit. The problem was never crypto, the problem was *they invested more than they could afford to lose*.\n\n**Pay Taxes As You Go**\n\nThis is actually just a specific case of the above point but I think it bears special mention. It's one thing to be penniless, it's another to be in debt, it's another still to be in debt to the government. The first case is miserable but you can still live on credit, the second case is bankruptcy and homelessness, the third case is debtor's prison. You cannot afford to invest money into speculative assets that you owe for taxes. Therefore, whenever you rotate positions you should take whatever sum you need to to cover the taxes out to safer havens.\n\nThe specific case that wrecks people has to do with a crash just after the start of a new year like happened in... well 2018 and 2022. Just before the crash everyone rotates their capital back into the blue chip coins. When this happens even though they are reducing risk they are now selling something and buying something else at near all-time-high valuations. Then the crash hits, they tell themselves it's just a bear trap and don't sell, and by the time the tax bill is due they can't even liquidate their entire portfolio to pay the tax bill. Seriously, it's just less stressful to *pay taxes as you go.*\n\n**No One Is Giving Away Free Crypto**\n\nWhenever anything of significance happens in crypto some scammer always replies to the announcement to say \"To celebrate X event we're giving away free crypto. Send scamAddress some coins and get twice that back!\". This is a ridiculously stupid scam that has gotten a ridiculously stupid amount of money. I seriously can't fathom the number of millions of dollars worth of crypto this bullshit has pulled in. Sometimes I feel like people who lose money to this type of thing deserve to do so. Mostly though I just feel sad for the evils the scammer is going to do with that money. How it is going to power the next wave of scams to be that much more prevalent and effective.\n\nLet me make this abundantly clear. I have been around awhile. I have been around for many significant events in crypto. No one reputable is ever giving away free ETH. For any reason. Ever. I don't care if their account name is Elon Musk and you think he's so eccentric he might actually be doing it. I don't care if they have a blue checkmark next to their name and it appears to be the same account as the one making the announcement. I don't care if it says its part of a fun new airdrop they are doing. Ever.\n\nMore generally, even in an ecosystem where 1000% gains aren't uncommon, if it looks too good to be true, that's because it is. If you see some 1000% yield LP position on some token you've never heard of it's almost certainly being fueled by inflation and you are gambling against the loss of value of your collateral. If you see some stablecoin position with unusually high yield that stablecoin probably isn't stable. If it actually is using a safe collateral and is on a safe platform and isn't a scam it's either a very new position and is about to be quickly diluted or it's being fueled by someone's marketing budget and is about to be quickly diluted.\n\nWhether in web2 or web3, if you don't understand how you're adding value to an ecosystem that doesn't mean you aren't. If you aren't paying, you're the product. When you receive airdrops, you are being compensated for being an early user, taking early risks, boosting the numbers the team uses for valuations so they can get more funding, etc. Even legit airdrops that you can sell the day you get them are not free crypto. *No one is giving away free crypto*.\n\n**Inflation Is Not Profit**\n\nEvery bull market in crypto has been marked by certain design patterns in tokenomics. I can mostly tell you a time range when a token was launched by its tokenomics alone like some archeologist telling you whether some ruins they just found originated from the Romans, the Muslims, or the Catholics. One of those design trends in early 2021 was to launch highly inflationary tokens and then use high APR numbers to encourage people to buy the token and stake it for rewards. This was basically just a new type of casino. Your net worth would go down even as the number of tokens you hold went up 10x a year. This was basically preying on the ignorance of users who didn't really understand finance but it worked for a time while the profit the hype generated was able to expand the user base faster than the inflation rate. Once the model ran out of users to expand to the rest was history.[1][2][3][4] Whenever you see a high APR in some LP or staking pool you need to slow down and investigate where the money is coming from. If it's coming from inflation you need to understand that *inflation is not profit*.\n\n**If It's Good Enough For a Screenshot, Take Profit**\n\nAs volatile as crypto is there will come a time where you are massively up. You'll be up so much you will be in disbelief. You will refresh your portfolio checker every 15 minutes and the person sitting across the table from you will know you're doing it again because the green from the screen will be reflecting off your eyes. At this point, they will think you have a problem. At this point you actually do have a problem but that's besides the point! Here's the thing: you aren't a genius. Even if you actually are a genius you aren't up because you are a genius. It's just that time of the cycle.\n\nAt that time of the cycle everything you'll see in your media feed will reinforce how much of a genius you are. It's like the whole world just woke up and finally saw what you saw first. However, if you haven't heard this yet let me be the first to tell you: sentiment follow price. 90% of those investments everyone seems to agree can't possibly fail are destined for the dustbin of history. Ever heard of Feathercoin? If you were around at the time you couldn't not hear about it. How about EOS? OmiseGo? Request Network? None of these things are going to be top 100 again. When prices are up, everyone is a genius. When the liquidity leaves and you're holding the bag, you won't feel like it any more.\n\nHow will you know when the top is? If there was a numeric answer to that then we'd all just sell then and the top would come sooner. The best answer I can give you having lived through some unbelievable peaks and valleys is *if it's good enough for a screenshot, take profit*.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s the next chunk of my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dcdm7q/daily_general_discussion_june_10_2024/l8168fk/\">Rabbit Hole Explorer&#39;s Guide</a>.

Seriously, it&#39;s just less stressful to <em>pay taxes as you go.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>No One Is Giving Away Free Crypto</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whenever anything of significance happens in crypto some scammer always replies to the announcement to say &quot;To celebrate X event we&#39;re giving away free crypto. Send scamAddress some coins and get twice that back!&quot;. This is a ridiculously stupid scam that has gotten a ridiculously stupid amount of money. I seriously can&#39;t fathom the number of millions of dollars worth of crypto this bullshit has pulled in. Sometimes I feel like people who lose money to this type of thing deserve to do so. Mostly though I just feel sad for the evils the scammer is going to do with that money. How it is going to power the next wave of scams to be that much more prevalent and effective.</p>\n\n<p>Let me make this abundantly clear. I have been around awhile. I have been around for many significant events in crypto. No one reputable is ever giving away free ETH. For any reason. Ever. I don&#39;t care if their account name is Elon Musk and you think he&#39;s so eccentric he might actually be doing it. I don&#39;t care if they have a blue checkmark next to their name and it appears to be the same account as the one making the announcement. I don&#39;t care if it says its part of a fun new airdrop they are doing. Ever.</p>\n\n<p>More generally, even in an ecosystem where 1000% gains aren&#39;t uncommon, if it looks too good to be true, that&#39;s because it is. If you see some 1000% yield LP position on some token you&#39;ve never heard of it&#39;s almost certainly being fueled by inflation and you are gambling against the loss of value of your collateral. If you see some stablecoin position with unusually high yield that stablecoin probably isn&#39;t stable. If it actually is using a safe collateral and is on a safe platform and isn&#39;t a scam it&#39;s either a very new position and is about to be quickly diluted or it&#39;s being fueled by someone&#39;s marketing budget and is about to be quickly diluted.</p>\n\n<p>Whether in web2 or web3, if you don&#39;t understand how you&#39;re adding value to an ecosystem that doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t. If you aren&#39;t paying, you&#39;re the product. When you receive airdrops, you are being compensated for being an early user, taking early risks, boosting the numbers the team uses for valuations so they can get more funding, etc. Even legit airdrops that you can sell the day you get them are not free crypto. <em>No one is giving away free crypto</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inflation Is Not Profit</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every bull market in crypto has been marked by certain design patterns in tokenomics. I can mostly tell you a time range when a token was launched by its tokenomics alone like some archeologist telling you whether some ruins they just found originated from the Romans, the Muslims, or the Catholics. One of those design trends in early 2021 was to launch highly inflationary tokens and then use high APR numbers to encourage people to buy the token and stake it for rewards. This was basically just a new type of casino. Your net worth would go down even as the number of tokens you hold went up 10x a year. This was basically preying on the ignorance of users who didn&#39;t really understand finance but it worked for a time while the profit the hype generated was able to expand the user base faster than the inflation rate. Once the model ran out of users to expand to the rest was history.[1][2][3][4] Whenever you see a high APR in some LP or staking pool you need to slow down and investigate where the money is coming from. If it&#39;s coming from inflation you need to understand that <em>inflation is not profit</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If It&#39;s Good Enough For a Screenshot, Take Profit</strong></p>\n\n<p>As volatile as crypto is there will come a time where you are massively up. You&#39;ll be up so much you will be in disbelief. You will refresh your portfolio checker every 15 minutes and the person sitting across the table from you will know you&#39;re doing it again because the green from the screen will be reflecting off your eyes. At this point, they will think you have a problem. At this point you actually do have a problem but that&#39;s besides the point! Here&#39;s the thing: you aren&#39;t a genius. Even if you actually are a genius you aren&#39;t up because you are a genius. It&#39;s just that time of the cycle.</p>\n\n<p>At that time of the cycle everything you&#39;ll see in your media feed will reinforce how much of a genius you are. It&#39;s like the whole world just woke up and finally saw what you saw first. However, if you haven&#39;t heard this yet let me be the first to tell you: sentiment follow price. 90% of those investments everyone seems to agree can&#39;t possibly fail are destined for the dustbin of history. Ever heard of Feathercoin? If you were around at the time you couldn&#39;t not hear about it. How about EOS? OmiseGo? Request Network? None of these things are going to be top 100 again. When prices are up, everyone is a genius. When the liquidity leaves and you&#39;re holding the bag, you won&#39;t feel like it any more.</p>\n\n<p>How will you know when the top is? If there was a numeric answer to that then we&#39;d all just sell then and the top would come sooner. The best answer I can give you having lived through some unbelievable peaks and valleys is <em>if it&#39;s good enough for a screenshot, take profit</em>.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-22 15:45:12","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-07-22 15:59:28","id":"legfxyb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1e960uq","parent_id":"t3_1e960uq","score":31,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/clamchoda","body":"\u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064 ETH TAKE MY ENERGY \u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064 ETH TAKE MY ENERGY \u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-22 18:04:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"leh2b0z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1e960uq","parent_id":"t3_1e960uq","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/HauntedJockStrap88","body":"Looks like we are bear posting again in here? \n\nOkay I\u2019ll play.
