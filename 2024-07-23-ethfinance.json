The new etf&#39;s have fees between 0.15-0.25%. It is definitely worth making a change if you have your ETHE in a tax advantaged account. However, it doesn&#39;t need to be done today. I&#39;ve held ETHE for awhile now, so what&#39;s another 1 or 2 days at 2.5%. I&#39;m just waiting for things to settle down before switching. If you&#39;re holding in a taxable brokerage account, you&#39;ll need to run your own numbers to figure out if the difference in fee&#39;s are worth it, based on amount and how much longer you foresee holding on to ETH in an eft.</p>\n\n<p>Do note, that as an ETHE holder on the date of record, July 18th, greyscale spun 10% of the NAV of ETHE off into the new ETH etf. So you will receive an equal number of ETH shares as you had ETHE shares. They should appear in your account sometime today (or soon, have to love how slow tradfi can be sometimes).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-23 08:30:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lek2umb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1e9zgce","parent_id":"t1_lejr2s8","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Distant-Shores","body":"Happy ETF day all!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Happy ETF day all!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-23 07:29:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lejroda","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1e9zgce","parent_id":"t3_1e9zgce","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/sm3gh34d","body":"Great idea what you can do with some of those grayscale arbitrage profits, become a sponsor for the ethereum protocol attackathon:\n\n[https://immunefi.com/sponsor-ethereum-attackathon/](https://immunefi.com/sponsor-ethereum-attackathon/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Great idea what you can do with some of those grayscale arbitrage profits, become a sponsor for the ethereum protocol attackathon:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://immunefi.com/sponsor-ethereum-attackathon/\">https://immunefi.com/sponsor-ethereum-attackathon/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-23 12:02:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lel7cr3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1e9zgce","parent_id":"t3_1e9zgce","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-23 20:29:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lenkolf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1e9zgce","parent_id":"t3_1e9zgce","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LifelongHODL","body":"Who is Roman Storm?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Who is Roman Storm?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-23 22:42:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"leo07kx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1e9zgce","parent_id":"t1_lenkolf","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"A Tornado Cash developer.\n\nSo basically a man who is being prosecuted for spreading what has previously been defined by the US supreme court as free speech.
