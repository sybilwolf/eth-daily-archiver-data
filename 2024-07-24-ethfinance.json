Then the protocol must have a lever/incentive mechanism to prevent those levels from happening, or if they were to happen to disincentivize them and progressively self-correct. The best way to do so is by allowing a regime where staking observes a lower yield than not staking. Because if that happens, it's strictly less economically interesting to stake than to not stake (even ignoring that staking has some costs). Notice that up to here we don't have to agree yet on the % that is unhealthy for the protocol, just that it exists. If you think 99% staked is very bad, then the argument above follows, we just need to set that regime at 99%.\n\n- The previous bullet point argues in terms of economic cost to the protocol to maintain high % of stake. But you can also argue in technical terms. As mentioned in the previous post, aggregating attestations has a very real cost to the network. To the point it has been established in testnets that this is a bottleneck in terms of number of validators. There are some other proposals to mitigate this (like maxEB) and that's fine, those are not incompatible. But you can think that the burn is basically putting a price tag to that cost. As discussed previously, and thank you again for the remark, it's likely preferable to apply this burn on a per epoch basis to every staker. Instead of on a per attestation basis. This is a minor implementation detail but I think it's important to avoid participation games as per your previous remark.\n\n- Why a burn and not just a issuance reduction? Well, as I hope the issuance graph makes clear they are both an issuance reduction. But considering burns opens up a strictly bigger solution space, one where the issuance curve goes negative. Allowing a negative issuance regime is critical to allow the protocol to find a stable equilibrium that targets a % of total stake. Because the regime where the issuance goes negative is one where stakers are paying non-stakers, so it disincentivizes staking. And will make it so the protocol stabilizes the ratio of the 2. From the perspective of the protocol you may think that if the protocol has an unhealthy level of security, instead of overpaying for it, it may start charging the stakers. It also has the effect of self-stabilizing the total stake. Any value of total stake above the intersection with the X axis will result in burn of the stake, which brings it back down to that point.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here is a sample plot of how the issuance curve could look like (there is plenty of flexibility in the design of the burn mechanism in terms of scaling, so the following is just a proposal).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/HR94CZ4\">https://imgur.com/a/HR94CZ4</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In blue our current issuance curve where I have introduced a burn per epoch and validator that scales as ln(T), being T total amount staked. The constant factor can be used to tinker the maximum issuance, obviously.</p></li>\n<li><p>In green our current issuance curve.</p></li>\n<li><p>In red, the tempered issuance curve you have proposed in the past. Here I have chosen k to match 33M as per your paper.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you can see the parameters of the burn can be selected as to match very well the tempered issuance curve in the low stake range and up to the peak issuance level defined by the parameter k. \nBut the burn kicks in and starts to decrease the issuance and can make it negative.</p>\n\n<p>Why I think having a negative issuance regime is important in a few bullet points.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If we can agree that certain levels of % stake are unhealthy to the protocol. Then the protocol must have a lever/incentive mechanism to prevent those levels from happening, or if they were to happen to disincentivize them and progressively self-correct. The best way to do so is by allowing a regime where staking observes a lower yield than not staking. Because if that happens, it&#39;s strictly less economically interesting to stake than to not stake (even ignoring that staking has some costs). Notice that up to here we don&#39;t have to agree yet on the % that is unhealthy for the protocol, just that it exists. If you think 99% staked is very bad, then the argument above follows, we just need to set that regime at 99%.</p></li>\n<li><p>The previous bullet point argues in terms of economic cost to the protocol to maintain high % of stake. But you can also argue in technical terms. As mentioned in the previous post, aggregating attestations has a very real cost to the network. To the point it has been established in testnets that this is a bottleneck in terms of number of validators. There are some other proposals to mitigate this (like maxEB) and that&#39;s fine, those are not incompatible. But you can think that the burn is basically putting a price tag to that cost. As discussed previously, and thank you again for the remark, it&#39;s likely preferable to apply this burn on a per epoch basis to every staker. Instead of on a per attestation basis. This is a minor implementation detail but I think it&#39;s important to avoid participation games as per your previous remark.</p></li>\n<li><p>Why a burn and not just a issuance reduction? Well, as I hope the issuance graph makes clear they are both an issuance reduction. But considering burns opens up a strictly bigger solution space, one where the issuance curve goes negative. Allowing a negative issuance regime is critical to allow the protocol to find a stable equilibrium that targets a % of total stake. Because the regime where the issuance goes negative is one where stakers are paying non-stakers, so it disincentivizes staking. And will make it so the protocol stabilizes the ratio of the 2. From the perspective of the protocol you may think that if the protocol has an unhealthy level of security, instead of overpaying for it, it may start charging the stakers. It also has the effect of self-stabilizing the total stake. Any value of total stake above the intersection with the X axis will result in burn of the stake, which brings it back down to that point.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-26 01:41:20","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-07-26 02:27:58","id":"lf0707n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1eat246","parent_id":"t1_leuklo6","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/confusedguy1212","body":"https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-burn-a-simple-design/15590\n\nJustin drake talks about this a lot.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-burn-a-simple-design/15590\">https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-burn-a-simple-design/15590</a></p>\n\n<p>Justin drake talks about this a lot.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-24 14:51:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"les0cf8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1eat246","parent_id":"t1_lerikfg","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pa7x1","body":"This is a different concept.
