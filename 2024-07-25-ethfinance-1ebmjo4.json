All of these technical issues I list here where proclaimed by Solana figureheads as milestones until they themselves realized that they are actually bad designs just a few months after they have been released.\n\nTechnical issues:\n\n- Parallelization: Their implementation with setting transactions back into the queue if a resource is reserved already, adds a lot of jitter into the system which encourages sending the transaction several times in to the hope one of them will make it in. \n- Local fee market: There are non deterministic elements in it which allow people to get included even if they do not pay enough. This encourages spamming the chain. A user generally has a hard time figuring out how much they have to pay, so they tend to overpay. The origin of some of these issues are in the parallelization implementation above -> technical debt.

I am not sure what they expected would happen. \n- QUIC protocol implementation: This is a protocol which handles communication between nodes. They implemented it in a way, that it just discards data packages from nodes which already sent them a lot. Here I am honestly baffled that someone decided \"Yes, that is a good solution lets ship it\". It should have been obvious that such a solution will fail under heavy load. I am baffled here because their implementation of the QUIC protocol does not depend on underlying protocol features. They managed to design a bad system without any underlying technical debt. The good thing with their implementation is it can be changed without having to do a fork of the chain as it does not involve consensus changes.\n- Fee burn: They planned a fee burn, which is not really well thought through and shortly before the new settings should go live on mainnet some people realized it has unintended side effects, as it could move payments for transactions off chain. Validators opposed it and demand no fee to be burned. It is voted on and so it happens.\n\n\nTheir zk data compression stuff which is closer to a stateless implementation than a rollup sounds pretty great.
