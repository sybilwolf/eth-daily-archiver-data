The SEC&#39;s lawsuit against Uniswap makes exactly this point in a different context - I think they pointed out that Labs removing some tokens from the main Uniswap frontend proves they have some level of control over it. And although the SEC will probably lose the case on other grounds (or a new administration will withdraw it), they are right on this point. </p>\n\n<p>Uniswap and many other DAOs are exactly in the worst of all worlds - too much power exercised by the team to be properly decentralised, but too little to have all the benefits of being a proper company. Even if I put my cynical hat on and say that most DAOs are an exercise in the team controlling the product but trying to avoid regulation by pointing to &quot;decentralization&quot; and &quot;DAO governance&quot; while exercising total control, this is simply a BAD way to go about it - as in, it doesn&#39;t achieve the stated goal. </p>\n\n<p>The regulators may be on a mission to destroy crypto for political reasons but they are not stupid.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-26 05:50:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lf0yc69","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ecfslx","parent_id":"t1_lf0u7fm","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/therethno2ndbest","body":"Declined.
