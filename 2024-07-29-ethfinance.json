Great job, u/Tricky_Troll and Substidoots!\n\n----------\n\nAnyways, I was looking for a list of scams techniques that our community has encountered. Here's a short summary of the scams and how to avoid them, if even possible.\n\n####**Google Ad links**\n\n**How it worked**: User searched for polymarket and clicked on a google sponsored ad link (right above the actual link) directing to an identical page with a 1-character domain name difference. User then signed a permit Tx draining user of a specific token.\n\n**How to prevent**:\n\n1. Be extremely careful with Google ad links.\n1. Also be careful with domain typo squatting. Entering \"Umiswap\" instead of \"Uniswap\" is all it takes to get drained.\n1. Test with a small amount first, and don't do unlimited approvals/permits on the test transation\n\nA wallet guard or advanced-security wallet like Rabby wallet can prevent some of these kinds of attacks.\n\n####**Bridge hack**\n\n**How it worked**: DeFI protocol LI.FI's L2 Bridge got hacked. Contract was drained. (User narrowly avoided hack by using good practices.)\n\n**How to prevent**: Don't approve more than you need to use. Try to use official bridges when possible. Be careful with DeFi bridges. \n\n####**Persistent spear phishing attack + Homoglyph attack**\n\n**How it worked**: Attacker called and emailed multiple times about a known recent hack of specific account belonging to the user that got its info leaked (the leak part was true). They had the user's account due to the recent leak. The domain was indistinguishable from the official domain, but it used an identical-looking foreign character instead of the real English character (**a homoglyph**). User didn't fall for it, but attack was convincing due to its persistence and professionalism.\n\n**How to prevent**: Remain skeptical about calls and emails. Always be wary of ayone who tries to rush you into making hasty decisions. Always check email and website domains, though in this case that wouldn't have helped since the domain was practically indistinguishable (homoglyph). In this case, don't click on the email link. Instead, retype the link in the address bar.\n\n####**Home break-in with armed attackers**\n\n**How attacked**: Crypto dev with 10k followers had a home break-in with armed attackers\n\n**How to prevent**: Well, this is really hard to prevent if you already have your info public due to a previous mass data leak. Everyone has already had their data leaked multiple times. If you're rich, maybe get good security and have a throwaway wallet. Honestly, I don't really have a good way to prevent this. On the other hand, this attack is not specific to crypto.\n\n####**Address poisoning a test transaction**\n\n**How it worked**: User made test transaction (which is good practice) in preparation for a bigger transaction. Immediately got address-poisoned by an attacker monitoring whale addresses. User then used the poisoned address from the account's transaction history. (Story seems a bit fishy since the user should've been an expert at avoiding common attacks.)\n\n**How to prevent**: Use an address book with whitelisted addresses. Be wary of address poisoning attacks. Don't copy addresses from the transaction history.\n\n####**Liquidity Pool was hacked**\n\n**How it worked**: Self-explanitory. Liquidity Pool was hacked. User's LP wallet was drained.\n\n**How to prevent**: Be careful when joining LPs. Some of them have bugs or exploits. User was able to avoid heavy damage because he kept his LP wallet separated from his main wallets.\n\n####**Warpcast frames**\n\n**How it worked**: Blindly trusting a mint via a Warpcast frame\n\n**How to prevent**: Don't immediately assume that people on Warpcast are trustworthy. Treat it like a slightly-safer Twitter.\n\n####**Supply-side attack**\n\n**How it worked**: 2 separate reports for this kind of hack. In one, a hacker pulled off a BGP hijack (compromises routing protocol) of a crypto platform's service provider. In another, hacker compromised a github account of a library the a wallet software used.\n\n**How to prevent**: If you're the end user, there is no practical way to prevent this kind of attack. It doesn't matter if it's crypto or traditional finance, a supply-side attack can destroy you, and there's very little you can do about it. Stick with wallets and platforms that have good security practices to minimize the chances of this happening. Realistically, if some infrastructure's DNS or BGP gets hijacked, even crypto security experts can get screwed.\n\n####**Fake revoke scam**\n\n**How it worked**: This got reported multiple times, though I don't think anyone on the sub fell for it. Basically, after a large hack, scammers would link to fake revoke_dot_cash sites hoping to trick careless users who were rushing to revoke their approvals/permits.\n\n**How to prevent**: Don't fall for schemes that try to rush you into doing something and making a careless mistake. Type in website addresses manually.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s really cool that I was able to traverse back one day at a time <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/15dcqqy/daily_general_discussion_july_30_2023/ju2784k/\">a whole year</a> via Daily Doots without encountering a single broken link.

DePIN applications also require scalability and that&#39;s exactly what Ethereum protocol development has been focused on, and we now have a very easy development path to building scalable, custom blockchains that would be well suited for DePIN. But let&#39;s say an app on Solana coms out and supports millions of people and truly goes mainstream, then I think that would be amazing because it would provide validation for this kind of app, and development on Ethereum would naturally explode in order to capitalize on it.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, 99% of the planet is not on-chain right now, and certainly not using it daily like they do web2 applications. Any meaningful increase of that metric is a positive thing for all of crypto because we are starving of these mainstream types of applications. And I just think the time hasn&#39;t been right for DePIN for a while, and maybe that&#39;s starting to change.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-29 16:26:07","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-07-29 16:36:42","id":"lfkgapl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1eer8s9","parent_id":"t1_lfh6k3u","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/kenzi28","body":"$SWELL snapshot tomorrow please take note.\n\nI should have probably $20 worth of pearls at the rate they ran their tvl programme.\n\nRsweth sufferers, withdrawals probably going live this week too.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$SWELL snapshot tomorrow please take note.</p>\n\n<p>I should have probably $20 worth of pearls at the rate they ran their tvl programme.</p>\n\n<p>Rsweth sufferers, withdrawals probably going live this week too.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-29 01:21:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lfgj7n7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1eer8s9","parent_id":"t3_1eer8s9","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptomoon2020","body":"Is there an estimate to the value of a pearl?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is there an estimate to the value of a pearl?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-29 05:47:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lfhahno","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1eer8s9","parent_id":"t1_lfgj7n7","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/flYdeon","body":"When are we bringing the good old crab meme?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>When are we bringing the good old crab meme?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-29 04:47:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lfh2ldj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1eer8s9","parent_id":"t3_1eer8s9","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/5quat","body":"Hope this ages badly ;-)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hope this ages badly ;-)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-29 05:15:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lfh65oi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1eer8s9","parent_id":"t1_lfh2ldj","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/flYdeon","body":"me too...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>me too...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-29 06:05:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lfhczab","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1eer8s9","parent_id":"t1_lfh65oi","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/therethno2ndbest","body":"What\u2019s the difference between using Spark directly vs using Spark through Summer.fi? \n\nWould using Summer generate points in both Summer and Spark if a loan is taken out on Summer through Spark?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What\u2019s the difference between using Spark directly vs using Spark through Summer.fi? </p>\n\n<p>Would using Summer generate points in both Summer and Spark if a loan is taken out on Summer through Spark?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-29 05:08:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lfh59ef","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1eer8s9","parent_id":"t3_1eer8s9","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Nothing but lower highs since March and SOL is currently closer to previous ATH than ETH while outperforming over pretty much any timeframe you can pick.
