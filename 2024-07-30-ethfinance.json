But one thing you might be forgetting is the hostile regulation the US has had that prevents companies from using crypto. You can't do anything really. No Polymarket, no airdrops, no fundraising by NFTs (stoner cats), no synthetic assets (Synthetix, Kwenta), companies can't hold crypto today due to unfavorable rules, you can't make a dex (Uniswap SEC lawsuit), extra tax on Bitcoin mining, etc. The Biden admin wanted to push crypto out of the US rather than embrace it, imo, and it made a lot of companies scared to do anything. I think we can get far with four years of friendly regulation, whichever party wins.\n\n> Microsoft stock was down from 2001-2015, a 14 year secular bear. Even Apple's valuation lost five years.

The launch of Bitcoin, the launch of Ethereum, the merge, practical zero knowledge proofs, L2 design, etc.. Looking forward, I don&#39;t see as many zero-to-one moments left. We&#39;ve got DAS and stateless/snarkified EVM, both of which are strictly scaling tech. But with both L1 and L2 gas fees currently so low, I feel like Ethereum has already out-scaled its use cases at the present moment, and is now looking to the future when further scaling might actually be useful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree unfortunately and most of those things didn&#39;t even affect price much. But one thing you might be forgetting is the hostile regulation the US has had that prevents companies from using crypto. You can&#39;t do anything really. No Polymarket, no airdrops, no fundraising by NFTs (stoner cats), no synthetic assets (Synthetix, Kwenta), companies can&#39;t hold crypto today due to unfavorable rules, you can&#39;t make a dex (Uniswap SEC lawsuit), extra tax on Bitcoin mining, etc. The Biden admin wanted to push crypto out of the US rather than embrace it, imo, and it made a lot of companies scared to do anything.
