Which would make the median even lower, around 1-2 cents. Making even the lowest added value use cases (e.g. pay for coffee) perfectly viable. This is likely extremely conservative because if we start having serious financial applications on top of Ethereum (i.e. tokenized RWA) those fees are ridiculously low.

This assumption is based on the current burn %, which has typically floated around 80% of the tx cost.

That gives you an implied price of ETH of 30-35K USD just from blobspace alone. Add to that Ethereum's proper blockspace which in the past has been able to capture a similar figure of burn and you get to a price of ETH around 50K to 100K USD. The price estimate is simply a consequence of assuming ETH cannot be absurdly deflationary, if it were it would cause a supply crunch and the price would go upwards resulting in less burn until it estabilizes around the price that gets us to close to 0 inflation.\n\nMind you, this is a long-term view of the roadmap. It will take us still years to deliver Danksharding and 64 shards and onboard all the use cases.

So I will post it here as it explains why currently we get 1% of the L2 fees but that won't always be the case. TL;DR: It's a quirk of EIP-1559 style of pricing mechanism (which we use for blobs too). Whenever we saturate all the blockspace unleashed with Dencun it will create a fee market.

Ethereum's blockspace pricing is based on EIP-1559, which is very aggressive in its price adjustments. It uses an exponential adjustment, this is good for very quickly pricing bursts of demand. But if blockspace capacity is above demand, it sends prices of blockspace to 0.\n> \n> With the release of Dencun upgrade we went from having capacity for 15 tps to having 30x that over night (around 500ish tps). Until we start saturating additional capacity the price of blockspace is basically free. The good news is that we are getting there quite quick. Already doing more than 300 tps daily just a few months after. When we start to saturate a fee market will start to develop. So looking at Ethereum's current economic fundamental figures and extrapolating further can be quite misguiding, Ethereum is giving up its product for free at the moment to entice demand.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The broker charging 5 usd or the registration of car titles I liken to more the app protocol level fee, not gas for tx.

Didn't see any posts about it, but maybe I missed them, it's been hectic running around to try to attend everything (and missing most of it). Either way I thought I'd share my subjective experience as a normally privacy-conscious grumpy internet man.\n\nFirst, the quality of that conference was impressive. On every aspect. Coordinating any event is no easy task, and here the organization was top notch. As someone who doesn't speak a word of Japanese and can hardly mumble coherent English, the EDCON team aptly corraled me and others wherever they needed to be.\n\nGreat venues too. Most days we were at the United Nations building. I think the whole building catered to the convention? One big conference room housing about ~400 people for the main talks, and side conference rooms for side talks/workshops. Then the main 2 days took place at the Yoyogi gymnasiums, which were OK for the more festive atmospheres they were meant to be, but a bit iffy on acoustics when it comes to listening to technical talks.\n\nOf course this is what matters most, the quality of these talks. I have to say this did not disappoint. There's something to be said for being committed to an event and passively sitting there for hours, as opposed to surfing the Internet and actively seeking knowledge. Whether you want it or not, when you're physically present your brain starts to absorb knowledge like a plant does photosynthetis.\n\nIn particular, I found all the talks on MPC (Multi Party Computation), TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) especially interesting. Many of us have seen these terms many times, the most adventurous among us even try to read Vitalik's blogs on the topic. Personally it still failed to click for me. Until I sat in these rooms and saw the points explained and reexplained in a variety of different ways by various speakers.\n\nMajor props in particular to the panel between Guy Itzhaki (Fhenix), Zhen Yu Yong (Web3Auth), Chua Zheng Leong (Automata). Three guys who manifestly know their stuff and engaged with each other to make these concepts obvious to the crowd. The theme was MPC vs TEE vs FHE, but really it came down to them explaining where each solution makes the most sense. I don't know when EDCON will put the videos of these talks online, but if there's one panel I'd suggest watching, it would be this one.\n\nIn person, you truly get to see who's passionate and who's acting. Either that or there were some excellent actors. The aura of highbrained discussion shifts your perspective, you get caught in the enthusiasm. When I first saw Fhenix (which is a L2) online, my cynical ass thought oh joy, they took FHE and made a little play with Phenix, how \"clever\". Post conference? Oh, they took FHE and made a little wordplay with Phenix! How clever! (his frown and cynicism: gone)\n\nAnother protocol that flipped me 180 was Zircuit. Initially (online) their marketing as an AI-powered L2 made me scoff. But the talk by their CTO made an excellent case for the future of sequencers, differentiating themselves by subjective qualities rather than the objective increases of scale. I got to speak with one of their devs, who told me the AI is really used for data analysis, to classify the possible pathways for DeFi hacks we've seen in the past, and then identify transactions that look functionally similar and send them in quarantine before inspection. Which is entirely sensible when you think about it. So many exploits boil down to flashloans, oracle manipulations and high changes of volume in a single block, that it should be not only possible but practical to build heuristics to defeat most common attack vectors.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm now accumulating some Zircuit points...\n\nIntmax people were on several panels, and then they featured proeminently at Plasmacon the next day as they were organizing it. Justin Drake had a pretty cool gigabrain (omegabrain?) talk about it. I won't even try to pretend I can explain, save that you can run pretty aggressive compressions for payment usecases. \n\nJustin also made the interesting case BTC as an asset could survive a 51% attack (which in his opinion will happen within ~10 years) by using one-shot quantum signatures and leaving the PoW chain behind. Right, I understand some of these words.\n\nAdrian Brink of Anoma had several talks on completely different topics, all great stuff. He's a good speaker and obviously a smart man, if a little bit too smart as his presentations tend to end up too dense with information.

Didn&#39;t see any posts about it, but maybe I missed them, it&#39;s been hectic running around to try to attend everything (and missing most of it). Either way I thought I&#39;d share my subjective experience as a normally privacy-conscious grumpy internet man.</p>\n\n<p>First, the quality of that conference was impressive. On every aspect. Coordinating any event is no easy task, and here the organization was top notch. As someone who doesn&#39;t speak a word of Japanese and can hardly mumble coherent English, the EDCON team aptly corraled me and others wherever they needed to be.</p>\n\n<p>Great venues too. Most days we were at the United Nations building. I think the whole building catered to the convention? One big conference room housing about ~400 people for the main talks, and side conference rooms for side talks/workshops. Then the main 2 days took place at the Yoyogi gymnasiums, which were OK for the more festive atmospheres they were meant to be, but a bit iffy on acoustics when it comes to listening to technical talks.</p>\n\n<p>Of course this is what matters most, the quality of these talks. I have to say this did not disappoint. There&#39;s something to be said for being committed to an event and passively sitting there for hours, as opposed to surfing the Internet and actively seeking knowledge. Whether you want it or not, when you&#39;re physically present your brain starts to absorb knowledge like a plant does photosynthetis.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, I found all the talks on MPC (Multi Party Computation), TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) especially interesting. Many of us have seen these terms many times, the most adventurous among us even try to read Vitalik&#39;s blogs on the topic. Personally it still failed to click for me. Until I sat in these rooms and saw the points explained and reexplained in a variety of different ways by various speakers.</p>\n\n<p>Major props in particular to the panel between Guy Itzhaki (Fhenix), Zhen Yu Yong (Web3Auth), Chua Zheng Leong (Automata). Three guys who manifestly know their stuff and engaged with each other to make these concepts obvious to the crowd. The theme was MPC vs TEE vs FHE, but really it came down to them explaining where each solution makes the most sense. I don&#39;t know when EDCON will put the videos of these talks online, but if there&#39;s one panel I&#39;d suggest watching, it would be this one.</p>\n\n<p>In person, you truly get to see who&#39;s passionate and who&#39;s acting. Either that or there were some excellent actors. The aura of highbrained discussion shifts your perspective, you get caught in the enthusiasm. When I first saw Fhenix (which is a L2) online, my cynical ass thought oh joy, they took FHE and made a little play with Phenix, how &quot;clever&quot;. Post conference? Oh, they took FHE and made a little wordplay with Phenix! How clever! (his frown and cynicism: gone)</p>\n\n<p>Another protocol that flipped me 180 was Zircuit. Initially (online) their marketing as an AI-powered L2 made me scoff. But the talk by their CTO made an excellent case for the future of sequencers, differentiating themselves by subjective qualities rather than the objective increases of scale. I got to speak with one of their devs, who told me the AI is really used for data analysis, to classify the possible pathways for DeFi hacks we&#39;ve seen in the past, and then identify transactions that look functionally similar and send them in quarantine before inspection. Which is entirely sensible when you think about it. So many exploits boil down to flashloans, oracle manipulations and high changes of volume in a single block, that it should be not only possible but practical to build heuristics to defeat most common attack vectors.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, I&#39;m now accumulating some Zircuit points...</p>\n\n<p>Intmax people were on several panels, and then they featured proeminently at Plasmacon the next day as they were organizing it. Justin Drake had a pretty cool gigabrain (omegabrain?) talk about it. I won&#39;t even try to pretend I can explain, save that you can run pretty aggressive compressions for payment usecases. </p>\n\n<p>Justin also made the interesting case BTC as an asset could survive a 51% attack (which in his opinion will happen within ~10 years) by using one-shot quantum signatures and leaving the PoW chain behind. Right, I understand some of these words.</p>\n\n<p>Adrian Brink of Anoma had several talks on completely different topics, all great stuff. He&#39;s a good speaker and obviously a smart man, if a little bit too smart as his presentations tend to end up too dense with information. I liked his hot take in Plasmacon the most, paraphrased: if we define scalability as the ability to retain fixed costs no matter the activity, then rollups are not a viable scaling solution, while Plasma can be. Personally I think the burden on app developers (who have to guarantee data availability or think of the right incentive mechanisms for others to provide it) is too large for the time being, and I would not bet on Plasma being big at scale before 2030, but what do I know?</p>\n\n<p>The more relevant point, maybe, is that a whole lot of people are clearly building for 2030 and beyond.

And there was a lot more to it! The hackathons were great, you get to see what people are building. Much of it was sponsored by zkSync. There was a funny dynamic to this. First you'd hear the zkSync guys describe their newest infra directions, the possibilities it allows. Then the hackers would show up on stage... and after their presentations, would be assaulted by technical questions from the very same zkSync people. \"What do you think about this potential issue? Have you thought about using specific feature X in your app? What about...\" All in good form, benevolent, but nonetheless you got the vibe of Infra Nobility questioning Application Peasants. If there ever was a need to illustrate this current reality in our industry, I think it was on display there, in those poor hackers' confused answers.\n\nzkSync had the best swag. They brought their eli5 books (which you might have already seen here: https://eli5.zksync.io/ ), in Japanese and English. A 200-piece puzzle box. Their mascot \"Zeek\" was proeminently featured. They're killing it on branding, it's stuff you're happy to own because it looks visually pleasing, and it's appropriate for kids too.\n\nThey had this pretty slick zkQuest website too: https://zkquest.zksync.io\n\nWhich you activated by going to their booth. It let you do a bunch of developer quests, ranging from very simple to rather involved, and covered a large spread of topics in their ecosystem. You got real ETH for finishing those quests, and the amounts were rather generous! Doing everything could net you about 0.065 ETH.\n\n(Most people didn't. I only managed less than half, and I'm in the top50 leaderboard.)\n\nOh, and finishing the first set of easier quests got you the coolest swag, a Zeek hat. It was genuinely cool to see people wandering around with theirs on, you could tell who's engaging deeply with the developer side of the conference. Status signals like this make for fun crowd dynamics.\n\nThe PSE research group (pse.dev) worked the same magic in their FHE panel. They demonstrated this app letting you connect with other people by tapping your NFC-enabled phone to a ring, to then let you make private groups and vote on various things anonymously. In the end everyone who participated got a NFC black ring. More subtle than a Zeek hat, it was neat to spot other ringbearers in the wild through the rest of the conference.\n\nThe entertainment was fun. Partly because there was clear confusion between the attendees and the shows. You hear stories about fans going ga-ga for Kpop, then you're here watching tripleS get on stage and half of the crowd is getting up and walking away.\n\n(It was just after Vitalik's keynote. You could see the flow of the wave moving in for his talk, then moving back out. Half of the total crowd or so.)\n\nI made it a purpose to approach this conference while revealing as little about myself as possible. I did not specify my job, my occupation, made it a point to say I was neither a developer nor an investor, didn't tell my name, never connected my Twitter or Telegram to anything. My goal in that was to see how open the culture is, to check whether reputation/identity are defacto requirements or if people are willing to engage with you regardless.\n\nThe conference scored highly on that scale. I applied to almost all side events, and almost everyone let me in. I didn't try to approach people, but several individuals came to me. Out of them only one I would qualify as a shitcoin shiller, and even then he was fairly respectful and didn't try to push beyond giving me the swag. Everyone else was insightful, loved to trade ideas and talk about what they were doing. I'm not a particularly charismatic person, so to come in anonymous and get this amount of positive sentiment and friendliness freely extended... truly suggests, at least to me, the community has done a good job translating the \"permissionless\" concept to real life.\n\nThere was a good spread of side events. Whatever it is you wanted to do. If you wanted to go deep into some technical topic, there was a side event for that in a crowded classroom somewhere. If you wanted to watch Japanese idols sing some songs about smart contracts being the next hope of humanity, there was a side event for that too. I went to everything I could, if only because as a first-time Japan tourist it made for a guide to discover the hot spots in town. It was a good reminder blockchain leans young. You could count the people with grey hair on your two hands, if not two fingers.\n\nSubjective conclusion to subjective experience. I had a blast. In life it's easy to nerd out and it's easy to have fun, but it can be hard to find a crowd doing both. I'm also flabbergasted this value is delivered essentially for free. As the EDCON tickets were given to anyone who applied near the end. There was a healthy mix of foreigners to locals, maybe about 60:40. Most of the talks were in English with some AI real-time translation in Japanese.\n\nStrangely enough, it only reaffirmed my belief going to conferences is a tricky path. As in, you can lose sight of the \"real\" users, onchain. Free tickets to attend or no, the guy from Serbia who makes \u20ac600 a month is not hopping on a flight to Tokyo anytime soon. The attendance was definitely biaised towards rich, and it's easy to feel optimistic when you're here either because you're financially independent or because your well-paid job foots the bill.\n\nThere's a counterpoint in that the Ethereum community goes through significant effort to diversify event locations and to make things accessible. At this point there's probably something somewhere anyone could attend, given a reasonable effort.\n\nIt's hard to stay objective when you're having a good time. I now have so much positive bias towards several protocols based on my people encounters. There's a reason many societies have strict anti-bribery laws, most of us get swayed easily; and man do I feel bribed out in the abundance of free stuff thrown my way.\n\nBut you know what? Maybe objectivity is overrated. Brings to mind a certain WEF video: \"welcome to the 2030 roadmap. I own all the things, I have some privacy, and life has never been better.\"\n\nIf you ever feel down about this space and have the opportunity to attend, do yourself a favor and take the plunge.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>(2/2)</p>\n\n<p>So the main stuff was good.
