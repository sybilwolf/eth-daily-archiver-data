Hmm\n\nThe main flaw of ETH is that it\u2019s probably not as decentralized as many people think. This is due to two reasons:\n\n1. 72 million ETH was premined and gifted to investors/founders\n\nBefore ETH was launched in 2014 its founders approached investors and promised them coins for backing the project. This way 72 million coins were sold/given to investors and founders which is much more than 50% of the circulating supply today! (circulating supply on 29.03.2023:\u00a0122 millions)\n\nOf course we can presume that some of the coins were sold throughout the years as ETH price went from ICO\u2019s 0.31$ (sic!) to almost 5k dollars at ATH in 2021 (a modest 16,000+ x return of investment if you\u2019re wondering). But what if Ethereum Foundation and vanilla investors who are close with them manipulated the market (which is very possible to do when you own such a high % of all coins) and sold tops and bought lows to own even more coins?\n\nThis is obviously just a speculation but the initial premining of coins is a fact and everyone should be aware of this. It might make you look at the POW->POS switch form a different perspective knowing that PoS is very beneficial for those who already have many coins (the rich get richer)\n\n2. 1/4 of nodes run on Amazon servers\n\nIf you go on this site:\u00a0[https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/)\u00a0you can see that Amazon boasts that 25% of ETH nodes run on their servers. I think 25% is a very significant number. Can Ethereum be a truly decentralized blockchain if so many nodes use Amazon Web Servers? Is the motto \u201cempower the little guy, screw the big guy\u201d true if the little guys use the big guy\u2019s service? I don\u2019t think so\n\nSpeaking of nodes\u2026\n\nIt's so damn expensive to run ETH node!\n\nTo run a full ETH node you need 32 coins which even during this bear market amounts to almost 60k dollars:\u00a0[https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/](https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/)\n\nSo much for the empowering of the little guy!\n\nYou can of course join pools but that\u2019s not the same. Plus you risk losing your coins if the pool you joined turns out to be a bad actor. You have to take a good look at the pool before joining it and find out if it's trustworthy, transparent and what's its track record\n\nSpeaking of high prices\u2026\n\nETH gas fees are pain in the\u2026 wallet\n\nAs you probably know, all transactions on Ethereum blockchain are paid in ETH (gwei). There is nothing strange about that but since ETH puts a lot of focus on security, it means that storage and processing power costs more. And the more popular ETH becomes, the higher the cost of storage and processing power becomes = the gas fees are more expensive. It is not easy to solve this problem. Just look at Solana \u2013 it has very small fees but its security has more holes than a Swiss cheese. This is why there are second layer (L2) solution\n\nBut layer 2 solutions have their own problems and they reduce security\n\nSpeaking of security\u2026\n\nETH might be deemed a security\n\nSince the transition from PoW to PoS, Gary Gensler argues that ETH is a security. He uses\u00a0Howey Test\u00a0in his argumentation. But it doesn\u2019t really matter what argumentation he uses. As long as Gensler holds any power, Ethereum and all PoS coins are in danger.

And maybe that&#39;s created with some automation options enabled out of the box, too, so it&#39;s safe even if you&#39;re not looking at it right away.)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-07 03:19:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lgx0lc4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ejnbk4","parent_id":"t1_lgiozea","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-04 16:51:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lgj45sq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ejnbk4","parent_id":"t3_1ejnbk4","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Surely it must go up faster than everyone else then right? \u2026Right?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Surely it must go up faster than everyone else then right? \u2026Right?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-04 17:09:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lgj6tnp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ejnbk4","parent_id":"t1_lgj45sq","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"It was catching up","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It was catching up</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-04 18:16:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lgjgsyu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ejnbk4","parent_id":"t1_lgj45sq","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/TheMoondanceKid","body":"CAN'T SOMEBODY STOP THIS ILLEGAL NAKED SHORTING??","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>CAN&#39;T SOMEBODY STOP THIS ILLEGAL NAKED SHORTING??</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-04 17:23:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lgj8z7s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ejnbk4","parent_id":"t3_1ejnbk4","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cutsnek","body":"They could but that would mean stopping the illegal naked longs as well.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>They could but that would mean stopping the illegal naked longs as well.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-04 17:27:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lgj9k2n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ejnbk4","parent_id":"t1_lgj8z7s","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheMoondanceKid","body":"But I like those","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>But I like those</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-04 18:08:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lgjfoj5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ejnbk4","parent_id":"t1_lgj9k2n","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cutsnek","body":"You know the old saying \"If you can't handle my illegal naked shorts at my worst.

A largely corrupt regime was overthrown in favour of a more democratic one. So if the Ukrainian people wanted to remain with a Russian aligned Yanukovic style government they would've voted for that. It's the same with EU and NATO membership. These are opt-in alliances. NATO isn't aggressively expanding towards Russia as the Kremlin claims, rather Russia is treating its neighbours like shit and it is pushing them out of their sphere of influence unless Russia stops them by force. Now to be clear, I'm not in favour of Ukraine joining NATO but the narrative of how people interpret NATO expansion is important. There's an alternate universe where NATO disbanded due to the lack of a common threat to align against and Putin's aggression is what has prevented this and led to Russia's neighbours wanting to opt in to western systems over Russian ones. Nobody is forcing them to lean westwards, that's fully the will of the people in these countries and largely the result of Putin's own actions. After all, most of these countries which have military trouble with Russia are small and want protection. If Russia's version of NATO, the CSTO were actually worth something then these countries might want to opt into that. But Russia completely ignored Armenia's invocation of the CSTO's article 5 equivalent a few years ago after Azerbaijan invaded Nagorno-Karabakh.

When I write my comments I tend to write it as I react and I&#39;ve been trying to censor myself a bit before I post it lately to remove the emotional language. I forgot to do that on this occasion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>the US overthrew Yanukovic the former President of the Ukraine with help of the right wing, exactly the day after the EU had agreed with Yanukovic to have early elections and to have a standdown on both sides. They stormed the goverment building with help of the right wing and overthrew the president and within hours the US stated their support for the new government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, but the Ukrainian populace also voted for Zelensky in the years to follow. A largely corrupt regime was overthrown in favour of a more democratic one. So if the Ukrainian people wanted to remain with a Russian aligned Yanukovic style government they would&#39;ve voted for that. It&#39;s the same with EU and NATO membership. These are opt-in alliances. NATO isn&#39;t aggressively expanding towards Russia as the Kremlin claims, rather Russia is treating its neighbours like shit and it is pushing them out of their sphere of influence unless Russia stops them by force. Now to be clear, I&#39;m not in favour of Ukraine joining NATO but the narrative of how people interpret NATO expansion is important. There&#39;s an alternate universe where NATO disbanded due to the lack of a common threat to align against and Putin&#39;s aggression is what has prevented this and led to Russia&#39;s neighbours wanting to opt in to western systems over Russian ones. Nobody is forcing them to lean westwards, that&#39;s fully the will of the people in these countries and largely the result of Putin&#39;s own actions. After all, most of these countries which have military trouble with Russia are small and want protection. If Russia&#39;s version of NATO, the CSTO were actually worth something then these countries might want to opt into that. But Russia completely ignored Armenia&#39;s invocation of the CSTO&#39;s article 5 equivalent a few years ago after Azerbaijan invaded Nagorno-Karabakh.
