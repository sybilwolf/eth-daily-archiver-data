Admittedly there aren't many interviews at any one time but every week or so a new opportunity pops up.\n\nBut that's not what I wanted to talk about. I want to discuss the things covered in the interview.\n\nFirstly, MetaMask are building way more features and are working on a number of fixes to the problems which most people have historically complained about like slow loading times and tokens not displaying without them being added manually. Furthermore, they've been working away and adding features like transaction simulation and scam warnings, the features which pulled many users over to Rabby.\n\n\"Well that's cool tricky, but Rabby is better in every way and I'm not moving back.\" Sure, that may be true about most of its UX, but it's not free you know? Rabby works of a web 2 data mining model. You're the product with Rabby and I personally despise web 3 companies which can't even align with web 3 values. There is nothing cypherpunk aligned about selling every last bit of data about users to the highest bidder (or more accurately, almost every bidder). What I learned was that MetaMask doesn't actually collect and sell personally identifiable user data and is free and open source software. A long time ago I tried reading their privacy policy but got lost in the legalese and gave up and just assumed they'd be selling something because they don't advertise their FOSS nature very well. Privacy is an important thing to consider because a browser extension has permission to access everything you do in the browser and that's a whole lot of private data to be mined if that is the extensions business model.\n\nSo while I still use Frame as my daily driver, I keep MM as a backup for picky projects like EigenLayer which have very limited wallet compatibility. Frame is built with privacy in mind and so most closely aligns with my priorities. But now knowing that MM is open source and also protects user data, I am happy to keep it sitting on my extensions bar for when I need it. Hopefully one day they keep iterating on the points I gave feedback on. These points of feedback I gave were:\n\n- Make it snappier with less time loading\n\n- Stop having it close when you click away or make it a desktop app which plugs into a browser like Frame does.\n\n- Auto-loading token balances\n\n- Make the extension automatically detect what network the website wants rather than always having to manually change network\n\n- Improve their MEV protection. They do currently have a tool for this but it means you need to wait about a minute for confirmation which can be a painful wait.\n\n- Comprehensive scam warnings and transaction simulation (they already have a version of this public, but I think it could be fleshed out a bit more.)\n\n- For a long time I was always frustrated by the lack of customisation in the settings but I checked again recently and there's a lot more to change now, and even more to come according to the devs I spoke to.\n\nFinally, I welcome anyone working for any of these wallet companies or who is more experienced/knowledgeable with all of the different available wallets to share their two wei. I think people tend to get a wallet and stick with it and not think too much about how their UX could be substantially better if they chose the right wallet.
