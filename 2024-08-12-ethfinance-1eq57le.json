I gave a quick answer from my phone but turns out I was a  \nbit off with the numbers.\n\nAn RTX 4090 can run about 6.2Billion private -> public key per second if we\u2019re smart about it (and not 200M as I stated yesterday), this means that to compute all possible private keys corresponding to addresses starting and ending with any 6 digits takes on average 12.5 hours.\n\nNow comes the storage part\u2026 We need to store 8192 TERABYTES of private keys. That\u2019s quite a lot. But we can be smart about it. Let\u2019s not store the full private key associated with each public key, but only a little information which will guide us to which area we need to bruteforce a second time to find the full private key (This will be quite quick, it\u2019s a small area and we brute quite fast). Doing this reduces the storage needs to about 128Tb, much more manageable \u2013 we don\u2019t need fast read speeds, so we can go with 8 16Tb HDDs which would set us back about 2k USD total.\n\nAll of this is fixed costs, so far, we probably spent about $3000 on hardware (Decent machine + drives) and we rented the GPUs for a couple bucks to create the big table. We don\u2019t need a fast GPU to do the query and re-bruting part, only to compute the initial table.\n\nThen comes the variable part: We need to listen to all Ethereum traffic using RPCs (public ones are free to use, and fast enough to listen to everything live) and for each TX originating from a sender with deep pockets, we\u2019ll send 2 transactions. One from our main wallet to the poison addy, then one from the poison addy to the victim. There are several variants of this, using raw ETH, or ERCs, or NFTs, etc\u2026 The cheapest gas-wise is obviously ETH.\n\nI ran initial stats on transactions sent from wallets having a balance > 10k$ (in ETH) to exchanges. There are some in roughly 20% of blocks in my sample (this means once every minute, approximately) Let\u2019s say an ETH transaction costs 50c at 1 or 2 gwei. This means we have to spend about 60 \\* 24 \\* 0.5 \\* 2 = 1440$ per day to operate our scheme. This gives us 1440 daily potential victims holding 10k$ each at the minimum. If a single one takes the bait, we\u2019re likely profitable on the day. And we have NOTHING to do once the thing is setup; everything is fully automated. Only cost is the eth for gas fees.\n\nNow imagine the carnage on L2s where running this is basically gas-free.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like it\u2019s hard to do.

Docs state that the FVM and rubidity compiler have training wheels on for the moment, where only certain dumb contract patterns are supported.  This is probably to protect the main/primary host FVM.  (I have assumed that there is a canonical FVM that would be used for tracking and serving state data)\n\nTheir approach seems to embrace centralization of all aspects of execution and consensus except for transaction ordering.  It appears to leverage ethereum as a messaging layer and transaction sequencer for an off-chain centralized vm and state.  Yes, anyone could re-index and re-execute the chain to verify its veracity, but if they get a different answer than the \"canonical\" execution FVM, what then? There is no mechanism to challenge the canonical state as far as I can tell.  I could be missing the point, maybe github commits are expected to the schelling point for consensus.  Execution \\*should\\* be deterministic, but even barring nefarious activity on the part of the 'canonical' fvm, there can always be bugs.  Maybe this system isn't intended to secure enough value to make it a concern.  Game state could reasonably work like this.\n\nAs far as I can tell it is not directly interoperable with ethereum assets without some kind of trusted bridge, since facet creators are incredibly highly unlikely to have the private key for the 0x00..00face7 address, even brute forcing using CREATE2.  They are not clear on this in the docs, but it seems to me that they could use a real address over which they have control and could use that as the basis for a less-trust-required bridge, but the address would be less \"cool\".\n\nPerhaps their thinking is that since there is no actual consensus mechanism, you should treat each Facet implementation (like 0x00..face7) as an island unto itself and never bridge anything of value.  Not sure.\n\nIt seems  like it would likely be a bit expensive compared to other L2s which can choose when to bundle and publish their execution proofs when blob gas is affordable (as we know it is usually quite cheap and inherently compressed compared to uncompressed calldata transactions on L1).  Every facet transaction would be a minimum of 21000 gas on L1, plus the cost of the ethscription calldata.\n\nAnother drawback is that \"off-chains\" like this share throughput with L1 execution, and periods of congestion and high gas prices would affect their ability to sequence any transactions at all.\n\nThx for the link, it introduced me to and got me thinking about alternate uses for ethscriptions.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>TL/DR, thoughts off the top of my head - I find Facet clever and intriguing, with some drawbacks around consensus,  cost, and throughput.</p>\n\n<p>It is an interesting idea that might be a good fit for some niche use cases, but it doesn&#39;t seem fully baked yet as far as I can tell.
