WebBank wouldn&#39;t want to make an exception for one customer (Gemini), because they&#39;d need to develop entirely new systems and SOPs to deal with customers who present crypto transactions as proof of credit card payments, and then it would no longer be profitable as a whitelabel product.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the reason why Gemini does not accept crypto to pay off Gemini credit card bills. Because at the end of the day, to save costs, it&#39;s a standard credit card issued by a standard bank.
