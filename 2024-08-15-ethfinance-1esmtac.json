They encourage devs with low tx cost use cases as far as I&#39;m concerned and that&#39;s not to mention the profits and treasuries of L2 tokens making it rain grant money down on L2 devs. So I actually think that L2s are a positive factor for our developer community.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, how much more ETH would we have to issue to pay stakers for running much beefier nodes? I can tell you right now that I would want at least double for me to set up a node with a 10-20 terabyte SSD. Now sure, maybe the burn would be higher to compensate but tx fees would also likely be higher than they currently are on L2s and that&#39;s neither a good UX nor would it allow high tx use cases like gaming to thrive.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-15 23:02:32","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-08-15 23:34:32","id":"lid5boc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1esmtac","parent_id":"t1_lid1gny","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/phigo50","body":"What *now* ffs...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What <em>now</em> ffs...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-15 11:43:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lia698s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1esmtac","parent_id":"t3_1esmtac","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Heringsalat100","body":"When do you think we're gonna reach 10k for the first time?\n\n2025? 2026? 2030?\n\nCurrently it seems that there is no hype in sight so I tend to choose 5+ years ...
