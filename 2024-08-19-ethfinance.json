Here are some thoughts to help organize my reasoning.\n\n1. Unless there's another obvious manic phase in the market, my goal is to hold for about five years to let the tech play out. By then we should have L2 composability, account abstraction, and the other basic building blocks that are still missing for real adoption of non-speculative use cases. By then I think it will be clear whether crypto is positioned to impact the world or not.\n2. When unsure about a decision, selling ETH is more stressful than buying ETH because of the asymmetric range of outcomes. Five years from now the price may increase many multiples of the current price, but it can't go below zero.\n3. ETH faces significant headwinds as an investment and I think it's more probable than not that the price five years from now will be lower than it is today, but it has so much potential that if Ethereum does get adoption the sky is the limit. So for example if you believe ETH has 30% chance of going 10x and 70% of going to zero over five years, then it's undervalued today even if an extremely risky bet.\n4. End users ultimately won't have to hold any ETH and will either pay fees in-kind (probably with stablecoins) or through a service provider. As a result I think PV of fees is the best model for ETH value and I don't think other currency or demand based approaches apply. To get an order of magnitude I assume a perpetuity with 10% discount rate, so the current $300B market cap assumes $30B fees a year. That seems very high but not impossible.\n5. I think most other crypto assets are egregiously overvalued, including BTC. The narrative of \"a greater fool will be willing to buy your asset for a higher price every four years\" will collapse at some point. This will be painful for ETH but is necessary for the space to mature. The other biggest challenge for the space will be overcoming the reputation of being ponzis, scams, and idiocy. Hopefully that tide is shifting.\n6. I think short term surprise upside shocks are now more likely than downside shocks. We're more likely to see a short term swing from \"Blackrock does XYZ\" or \"Mastercard creates an L2\" than another \"China bans crypto\" or \"this DeFi contract got hacked\".\n7. Ethereum will continue to centralize to some extent, just because of economies of scale, but I think it can fight to stay decentralized *enough* as it's the top priority for the devs and community.\n8. Following Crypto on Reddit is more stressful than actually interacting with crypto. I've got to get off of this thing.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I sold all my ETH six weeks ago, and today bought back what I sold.
