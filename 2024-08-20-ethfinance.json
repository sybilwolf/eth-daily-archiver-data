RISC-V is one of the more modern CPU architectures besides the well known x86 (most PCs) and ARM (Apple and cell phones). RISC-V started being developed around 2010 and got published around 2014. Only in the last few years the basic parts got standardized and the they are still in active development to standardize some of the extensions.  \n\nOne big difference is than anyone can design and build CPUs on this standard and many companies actually do. This is in contrast to x86 processors where only 3 companies have a license to actually design/build them: Intel, AMD, VIA Technologies. \nFor ARM CPUs anyone who buys a license from ARM Holdings can design and build ARM CPUs but these licenses can be very strict. For example, ARM Holdings is currently trying to force Qualcomm to destroy all ARM based Windows laptops due to a licensing dispute. \nRISC-V is open, which means anyone can design and build processors following this standard without having to pay anyone anything or follow any strict licensing rules. This means this is the most open CPU architecture we have. The disadvantage is that it is all very new and therefore the currently available Processors are not the most powerful ones. But the progress in just the last 5 years is quite amazing. Back then one could only get the most minimal boards which pretty much could only read some inputs do some basic calculations and control an output. There was no support to run any operating system on these boards. Linux support was pretty much non existent. \n\nToday, we can get boards which can easily run full Linux distributions even Ubuntu supports some boards directly and about every 9 months a new iteration of ever more powerful boards hit the market. The driver for this development is the openness. Companies know, that no one can take their licenses away and this gives them security to develop RISC-V based CPUs. This open competition will probably enable many more people to get access to affordable and powerful enough hardware to run an ethereum node. To get there however, the node clients themselves will have to be optimized for this hardware platform as well. \n\nThat is why another node operator was asking in many discords if anyone else is interested to help in this effort. I obviously jumped on this opportunity and we have been working on it in the last few weeks. We now got Nimbus, Lighthouse and geth running. They can be built with some modifications and run reliably. Some of the modifications have already been pushed to the respective client teams and some more modifications will come in the next weeks. We are working on some other clients as well (grandine, Reth and prysm) but they have some more issues which need further investigation.\n\nAt the moment we have 4 different boards to test our stuff on. These are the HiFive Unmatched, the VisionFive 2, the Lichee Pi 4a and the Banana Pi F3. All of these are at most barely powerful enough to actually run a full node. Nevertheless, we managed to fully and reliably sync the sepolia testnet on the Banana Pi (Nimbus/geth) and we even managed to sync mainnet with lighthouse, but only for brief periods of time until it lost sync again and then it was behind the head for about 1-3 hours until it regained sync again. We even overclocked our board which slightly improved the sync reliability, but not by much. Looks like the current iteration of boards is a good basis to test nodes and get the clients ready but we need at least one more iteration to be able to run nodes reliably. \n\nIn parallel, my colleague tries to incorporate as many improvements as necessary into eth-docker so that prospective node operators will have a very convenient way to spin up a node on these boards. It still is a very rocky road ahead, but I am pretty sure that when actually powerfull enough RISC-V boards will hit the market in 1-3 years or so, a good selection of clients will be ready to run on them.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Warning, very geeky hardware topic ahead. </p>\n\n<p>In the last few weeks I have worked on running Ethereum nodes on RISC-V boards.

What are the &quot;value adds&quot; that make it worth devoting attention to at an Executive level, *right now*? Other than whitepaper-speak which is theoretical at best. Heck, even with *some* talking points, as far as Tech goes, I&#39;m farrrrr more concerned with AI Regulation and policy associated with that than literally anything crypto-related.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>TELL HER YOU LOVE CRYPTO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t, though. What I *love* (as someone who is &quot;Progressive-Lite&quot;) are viable alternatives to mass tech centralization, new avenues to empower and fund small independent creators, mechanisms to enable retroactive funding, increase operational transparency, etc. Unfortunately, crypto is *not necessarily* the answer to these. The conviction I personally have for things Ethereum can be great for is not representative of what *actually* is driving the crypto world now. So I&#39;d much rather turn my attention to those *concepts* that are important, not just a single implementation for something that *maybe kinda sorta one day might* achieve those goals.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been here for several cycles, seen my expectations and hopes rise, only to be shut down again by crappy implementations, bad actors, or both. Like man, there are SO many things NFT&#39;s could&#39;ve been AMAZING for to help small creatives, but culturally we all decided to scam people, steal work, and suck as much money from people, and we&#39;ve rightfully earned the reputation we have now. We HAVE to get our shit together if we want to be effective. We don&#39;t get to just ignore that. Voters would *love* to see crypto fizzle out and die, and *they* are the ones who matter. Now how do we EARN their respect?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m totally not discouraging folks from letting their voices be heard of course, just pushing back on your frustrations with some of the perspectives here. It&#39;s not a matter of not feeling like our voices matter, but rather the things I care about haven&#39;t been properly represented in this space, and I&#39;m not surprised AT ALL that Dems don&#39;t talk about it when campaigning during a contentious election year. It&#39;s perfectly logical.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-20 09:57:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lj2gm7t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ewn8dw","parent_id":"t1_lj1zxbw","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/HauntedJockStrap88","body":"\nUnfortunately, for me it\u2019s hard to square \u201cits logical for the Dems to not talk about it during a contentious election cycle\u201d with the fact that they get elected and then point their unelected bureaucrats at the industry.

Who are you trying to hide your data from? Most people can't hide from 3 letter agencies without hugely inconveniencing their daily life, but that's ok because there are some legal protections to stop some degree of government abuse (for example police need to get warrants to search your home etc.) But if you post all of your life details to social media then police can just buy your data, they don't need to search your home if they can buy info from tech companies. Stalkers and $5 wrench attackers can do the same and hackers have waaaay more places to steal your info from making you more prone to phishing, burglary and much much more. Basically there are some super simple steps to make your digital footprint soooo much smaller. Things like degoogling, using uBlock origin and Firefox for browsing, avoiding cloud services in favour of physical backups or your own servers and not owning a car made after the mid 2010s which collects location and converstional data.

Most people can&#39;t hide from 3 letter agencies without hugely inconveniencing their daily life, but that&#39;s ok because there are some legal protections to stop some degree of government abuse (for example police need to get warrants to search your home etc.) But if you post all of your life details to social media then police can just buy your data, they don&#39;t need to search your home if they can buy info from tech companies. Stalkers and $5 wrench attackers can do the same and hackers have waaaay more places to steal your info from making you more prone to phishing, burglary and much much more.
