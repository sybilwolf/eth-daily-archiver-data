The ETH ETF launch has seen a verifiable outflow of ETH when factoring in the drainage of the ETHE fund. Which is unfortunately not the case for BTC's ETFs which has seen an inflow of BTC. And while the timeframes (and probably more importantly the markets) are different, BTC never actually saw a period of negative flows.\n\nRegardless, during the first weeks of both funds ETHE/GBTC had massive outflows. Likely for a bunch of reasons. I'd personally contend that the majority of that was people wanting out of the terrible ETHE/GBTC products (very high fees) and rotated into the 'better' funds. You can see in the graphs where there is a somewhat proportionally flow out & in first few days / weeks. (Meaning, you can generally see where the higher inflow days correlated with the higher ETHE outflow days. And as time went on inflows slowed while ETHE outflows slowed.)\n\nWhat seems to be circulating however is that nearly all those funds were from arbitrage traders. So ETH's outflows aren't really indicative of true demand, as a huge chunk of those outflows were just the arbitrage traders grabbing their bags and leaving and can effectively be ignored. Meaning at the end of the day ETH is seeing a lot more inflows than data indicates. For the record, I don't doubt that some of this is happening, but I'd contend it's not the majority and to just ignore that massive outflow is trying to find a way to fit a bullish narrative to a not so bullish set of data. \n\nLet's look at ETH's data, first two weeks (really 8 days due to mid-weeky launch) of net flow:\n\n* 7.24 - $110m\n* 7.25 - ($143m)\n* 7.26 - ($154m)\n* 7.29 - ($155m)\n* 7.30 - ($108m)\n* 7.31 - $27m\n* 8.1 - ($76m)\n* 8.2 - <1m difference\n* Total Net Outflow - $499m (@ say a maybe an average $3,300-ish price well say 151,200 ETH or so)\n\nWhile stopping there seems arbitrary, it's realistically the point where anyone in this type of trade has wound down. You can see in the graphs (see my reply) where week 3 had substantially less outflows then the first 2 weeks. With there (as of 8/17, waiting for the dune update - maybe weekly?) being a cumulative net outflow of $131,300 ETH since launch. We have the farside data that shows since 8/17 even more has flown out. So point being even backing out what is likely that arbitrage trade has ETH basically sitting even flow wise... versus seeing any type of massive outflow.\n\nTo speak to the trade itself and why I posted this. There was a discussion yesterday I don't think I got a full answer on --- the obvious arbitrage trade over the last few months was to buy ETH for 80 cents on the dollar by buying ETHE at a discount then waiting for the approval and the 20% jump as the discount closes to NAV. Especially for people who were holding ETH anyway and were confident in the approval. I do think a decent chunk of people did that. Now what was is being hinted at is that there is some type of larger trade going on here and after a way too long of a post the question becomes what exactly is that? I haven't super actively looked... but I haven't really seen discussions on it beyond arbitrage work. So if anyone has posts / articlees / tweets / eli5's please link them to me.\n\nDo note: I'm talking a somewhat technical dive into this - not just \"well they bought at a discount and sold at a premium!). Because part of the reality here is the ETHE is not issuing new shares when it is at a discount to the NAV. So anyone pulling this trade off is buying from the pool of already existing shares - which to me indicates a that these arbitrage traders are already representative of flows out in demand over the last few months. It's just the actual redemption of ETHE for ETH couldn't legally occur until we saw this huge net outflow to begin with.  Basically, even if we were to say the outflows were all arbitrage traders it still isn't a bullish sign that people 'gave up' on the product for the last 6 months (hell, even longer given the discount has been for a while now).\n\nIf I had to guess what this huge trade is, there was a 'sophisticated' entity / group of entities buying the ETHE at a 80% discount for months now. Then shorting an equal amount of ETH elsewhere. That way any price moment would be negated, and the gain could be made on the 20% pop on announcement of the ETF approval. It's essentially a reverse of the premium trade (Buy ETH, convert it to ETHE at NAV and wait 1 year to sell at a premium. All while shorting ETH to cover flucations in price). Maybe only better because small guys like us could actually pull off the discount trade since we didn't have to be accredited investors to get ETHE at NAV.\n\nWhew! Good Morning!
