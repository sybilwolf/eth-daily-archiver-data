More immutable and it needs to convince finance people that they can make more money with Ethereum than with their traditional ways. Thats it.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum is not a clowns show. We already have gamechanging concepts on the table. However those need to be understood and realized.  We dont need something new. We have yet to even reach 1% of the potential of whats already here</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-27 10:03:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lk7apdy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1f29003","parent_id":"t1_lk71r5q","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":">\tWhat do other chains have ?
