Millions per institution, millions per rollup.</p>\n\n<p>And then, a few days ago, Solana makes a 180\u00b0 pivot from calling L2s parasitic and announces it now supports L2s. <a href=\"https://x.com/Austin_Federa/status/1830570709900493293\">Rebrands them &quot;network extensions&quot;</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please take a second to wonder: why would Solana pivot to L2s right now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>At a moment when overall blockchain activity is moderate at best?</p>\n\n<p>Could it be that Sony made them realize Ethereum is about to onboard one institution after the other? That the only way they&#39;ll compete is by faking their way into L2 adoption partnerships?</p>\n\n<p>This is why the community push for blob fees worries me:</p>\n\n<p>The only reason Solana got any traction to begin with is because Ethereum L1 fees were way too high in the past. That&#39;s what drove users to less decentralized lands.</p>\n\n<p>Do we really want to make the same mistake again and offer an opportunity to Solana&#39;s L2s to gain any sort of traction? Not because we needed to but because we got greedy with our own few L2s?</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum should do what a market leader does: grow the market as fast as possible and cash in when the whole world is in.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-05 02:07:39","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-09-05 02:11:28","id":"lllo8ra","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1f9ef5k","parent_id":"t3_1f9ef5k","score":57,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"I'm going to basically repeat what you said in my own words, since I couldn't agree more completely.\n\nThere are two types of companies: ones that try to juice their next quarter for a modest investor return regardless of the health of the company, and ones that ignore their most vocal investors to build a long-term healthy company that ultimately makes their investors wealthy.

EOF does many validation checks during deployment instead of runtime, which can prevent some DOS attacks and might also help to increase the max size of smart contracts again (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-170.md). It also contains many smaller quality of life improvements for solidity developers. Some new calls are also introduced to interact with external contracts which improve efficiency.\nOverall the EOF improvements are rather complex and the disadvantage is that the legacy contracts still need to be supported which increases complexity by duplicating some of the logic.
