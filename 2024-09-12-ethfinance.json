At another point I also found that VPNs are an explicit NOPE from Coinbase and I was getting locked due to this (though again I was not informed, only learned this through my own digging)</p>\n\n<p>Tried every avenue I could think of and gave up at one point. Had a small but non-trivial balance and was ready to walk away. I got a new driver&#39;s license, used a new computer with no VPN, and performed another ID selfie verification. It failed, but I wrote back to the email demanding a &quot;MANUAL VERIFICATION REVIEW&quot;. Had to be firm and request this a couple of times in different emails. Finally, they must&#39;ve done a manual review or something because my account was unlocked without great fanfare and I&#39;ve been able to use it since. </p>\n\n<p>Side rant: has anyone else found that CB doesn&#39;t automatically log you out when you close the page? I logged back into my acct after a month of inactivity and was not prompted to provide credentials (even with 2FA enabled), simply logged in immediately once I clicked my bookmark. All other financial/data sensitive websites seem to auto logout upon closing a page. Weird CB doesn&#39;t do this? </p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: Never give up!
