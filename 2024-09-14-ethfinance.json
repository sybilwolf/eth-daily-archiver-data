I\u2019m [Ben and I am EVMaverick #813.](https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F1f7e14c5d056f3f53578a72c3a015235.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\n**Nice to meet you, Ben. How did you find your way into crypto?**\n\nMy coworkers were trading BTC/ETH/LTC on Coinbase in early 2017, so I bought my first during a big China FUD dip in September and started researching crypto on Reddit, where I found the r/ethtrader sub.\n\n**I see we gotta thank your coworkers \ud83d\ude02 And when and how did you come to join EVMavericks community?**\n\nI was smart/stupid enough to stick around r/ethtrader (and later r/ethfinance) community through the entire 2018/2019 bear markets, so I was an active commentor, which got me whitelisted for the EVMavericks mint.\n\n**So you are with us from the very beginning! What made you stay with the community through all the turbulent times, especially this bear market and even continue contributing to the degree that you do?**\n\nOther members in the ethfinance + EVMavericks community had SUCH strong conviction when I first joined, that it rubbed off on me -- I now know that Ethereum and blockchain tech will succeed.\n\nEvery day in crypto is different, so I really enjoy trying out new web3 projects and supporting/connecting with the folks that build them -- most of the time I hear about these projects from the EVMavericks, or I've shared it with them before anyone else.\n\n**Do you wanna name any folks who inspired you with their conviction or with their projects that created that enthusiasm for you to explore this crypto space?**\n\n-DC Investor was early to ETH/DeFi/NFTs and has stuck to his guns \n\n-JT, who hosts the weekly Doots podcast, has been through multiple hacks and still has such a huge smile on his face/will help anyone in the community\n\nmany others, but these two stuck out early on for me^\n\n**What's your favorite memory from EVMavericks that first comes to your mind?**\n\nRecency bias aside, I\u2019ve had a lot of fun helping to lead the EVMavericks/Doots Podcast funding initiative for Octant\u2019s upcoming PGF epoch!\n\nClose second = Colonoscopy Support Day POAP\n\n**Electric memories indeed! Let's switch it up a little bit, what is your fav hobby or how do you usually touch grass?**\n\nI love to see live music, play golf and spend time with my family!\n\nJust saw a concert and golfed twice over labor day weekend, so that was a blast!\n\n**Sounds like a fun time! Any alpha or advice that you wanna share with us? It can be anything.**\n\nLearn to be patient and prioritize delayed gratification if possible. Bear markets (any, really) can be trying at times, but if your timeline is months/years in the future, just know that your conviction will pay off. Then you can use your mental capacity to fortify that conviction or learn new things, rather than question your previous decisions.\n\n**Lastly, is there anything else you wanna share with us, Ben? The stage is yours.**\n\nThanks for having me 696 -- always good talking to you!\n\nPlease join us for [our weekly Doots livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/@evmavericks) (on the EVMavericks discord + YouTube) whenever you can! It's a great forum to learn about new developments in web3, where you can connect with the folks that are building them, along with the EVMavericks community!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F389232639e1f8d041e4a75a82ed7d28b.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75\">Get to know EVMavericks #3</a> - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bbroad25\">bbroad</a> aka Ben aka EVM 813</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hi, what do you go by and what&#39;s your EVMavericks #?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hi! I\u2019m <a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F1f7e14c5d056f3f53578a72c3a015235.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75\">Ben and I am EVMaverick #813.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nice to meet you, Ben. How did you find your way into crypto?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My coworkers were trading BTC/ETH/LTC on Coinbase in early 2017, so I bought my first during a big China FUD dip in September and started researching crypto on Reddit, where I found the <a href=\"/r/ethtrader\">r/ethtrader</a> sub.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I see we gotta thank your coworkers \ud83d\ude02 And when and how did you come to join EVMavericks community?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was smart/stupid enough to stick around <a href=\"/r/ethtrader\">r/ethtrader</a> (and later <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a>) community through the entire 2018/2019 bear markets, so I was an active commentor, which got me whitelisted for the EVMavericks mint.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So you are with us from the very beginning! What made you stay with the community through all the turbulent times, especially this bear market and even continue contributing to the degree that you do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Other members in the ethfinance + EVMavericks community had SUCH strong conviction when I first joined, that it rubbed off on me -- I now know that Ethereum and blockchain tech will succeed.</p>\n\n<p>Every day in crypto is different, so I really enjoy trying out new web3 projects and supporting/connecting with the folks that build them -- most of the time I hear about these projects from the EVMavericks, or I&#39;ve shared it with them before anyone else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you wanna name any folks who inspired you with their conviction or with their projects that created that enthusiasm for you to explore this crypto space?</strong></p>\n\n<p>-DC Investor was early to ETH/DeFi/NFTs and has stuck to his guns </p>\n\n<p>-JT, who hosts the weekly Doots podcast, has been through multiple hacks and still has such a huge smile on his face/will help anyone in the community</p>\n\n<p>many others, but these two stuck out early on for me^</p>\n\n<p><strong>What&#39;s your favorite memory from EVMavericks that first comes to your mind?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Recency bias aside, I\u2019ve had a lot of fun helping to lead the EVMavericks/Doots Podcast funding initiative for Octant\u2019s upcoming PGF epoch!</p>\n\n<p>Close second = Colonoscopy Support Day POAP</p>\n\n<p><strong>Electric memories indeed! Let&#39;s switch it up a little bit, what is your fav hobby or how do you usually touch grass?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I love to see live music, play golf and spend time with my family!</p>\n\n<p>Just saw a concert and golfed twice over labor day weekend, so that was a blast!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sounds like a fun time! Any alpha or advice that you wanna share with us? It can be anything.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Learn to be patient and prioritize delayed gratification if possible. Bear markets (any, really) can be trying at times, but if your timeline is months/years in the future, just know that your conviction will pay off. Then you can use your mental capacity to fortify that conviction or learn new things, rather than question your previous decisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lastly, is there anything else you wanna share with us, Ben? The stage is yours.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for having me 696 -- always good talking to you!</p>\n\n<p>Please join us for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@evmavericks\">our weekly Doots livestreams</a> (on the EVMavericks discord + YouTube) whenever you can!
