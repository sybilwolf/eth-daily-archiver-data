A bit ill intentioned on my part I have to admit but no less so than the delusional talks of the flipping and ultra sound money. \n\nI'll come back again when you're at .02X. Until then, enjoy bleeding on the ratio. \n\nHopefully my post is a bottom indicator for your bags but let's be honest - ethereum is a far riskier asset than Bitcoin and you've been paying for that risk with years of underperformance. There will be a relief rally eventually, probably even soon, but ETH/LTC/XRP/ADA/insert shitcoin of your choice here ain't making a new ATH against BTC anytime soon, and id wager never again. Tell yourself whatever you need to to hold on to your bags though, you were best off selling at the merge hype, and beware of anyone talking about a flipping - that sentiment historically is the single most bearish catalyst for eth/BTC, and it's still being mentioned here, so I venture the bottom is not yet found.
