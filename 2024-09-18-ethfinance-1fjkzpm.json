The fact that there have been multiple 90% drops and it is still the best performing asset class in the last decade is incredible. However, you can't always afford to ride it out. The crypto highs and lows tend to follow the macro highs and lows. So when crypto is low you're also jobless, economic opportunities are scarce, and you're scared. If you invest more than you can afford to lose when times are good, you could very well be one of the millions who find themselves selling while the market is down only to watch it do some crazy 30x the next cycle. People not following this advice is the source of the bitterness every time crypto comes up on your Facebook feed or technology subreddit. The problem was never crypto, the problem was *they invested more than they could afford to lose*.\n\n*Pay Taxes As You Go*\n\nThis is actually just a specific case of the above point but I think it bears special mention. It's one thing to be penniless. It's another to be in debt. It's another still to be *in debt to the government*. The first case is miserable but you can still live on credit. The second case is bankruptcy and homelessness. The third case is debtor's prison. You cannot afford to invest money you owe for taxes into speculative assets. Therefore, whenever you rotate positions you should take whatever sum you need to to cover the taxes out to safer havens.\n\nThe specific case that wrecks people has to do with a crash just after the start of a new year like happened in... well 2018 and 2022. Just before the crash everyone rotates their capital back into the blue chip coins. When this happens even though they are reducing risk they are now selling something and buying something else at near all-time-high valuations. Then the crash hits, they tell themselves it's just a bear trap and don't sell, and by the time the tax bill is due they can't even liquidate their entire portfolio to pay the tax bill. Seriously, it's just less stressful to *pay taxes as you go*.\n\n*No One Is Giving Away Free Crypto*\n\nWhenever anything of significance happens in crypto some scammer always replies to the announcement to say \"To celebrate X event we're giving away free crypto. Send scamAddress some coins and get twice that back!\". This is a ridiculously stupid scam that has gotten a ridiculously stupid amount of money. I seriously can't fathom how this bullshit has managed to pull in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto. Sometimes I feel like people who lose money to this type of thing deserve to do so. Mostly though I just feel sad for how this money is going to power the next wave of scams to be that much more prevalent and effective. They do this because it works and they are never going to stop.\n\nLet me make this abundantly clear. I have been around awhile. I have been around for many significant events in crypto. No one reputable is **ever** giving away free ETH. For any reason. **Ever**. I don't care if their account name is Elon Musk and you think he's so eccentric he might actually be doing it. I don't care if they have a blue checkmark next to their name and it appears to be the same account as the one making the announcement. I don't care if it says its part of a fun new airdrop they are doing. **Ever**.\n\nMore generally, even in an ecosystem where 1000% gains aren't uncommon, if it looks too good to be true, that's because it is. If you see some 1000% yield LP position on some token you've never heard of it's almost certainly being fueled by inflation and you are gambling against the loss of value of your collateral. If you see some stablecoin position with unusually high yield that stablecoin probably isn't stable. If it actually is using a safe collateral and is on a safe platform and isn't a scam it's either a very new position and is about to be quickly diluted or it's being fueled by someone's marketing budget and is about to be quickly diluted.\n\nWhether in web2 or web3, if you don't understand how you're adding value to an ecosystem you're the product. When you receive airdrops, you are being compensated for being an early user, taking early risks, boosting the numbers the team uses for valuations so they can get more funding, etc. Even legit airdrops that you can sell the day you get them are not free crypto. *No one is giving away free crypto*.\n\n*Inflation Is Not Profit*\n\nEvery bull market in crypto has been marked by certain design patterns in tokenomics. I can mostly tell you a time range when a token was launched by its tokenomics alone like how an archeologist can tell you which civilization some ruins come from by pointing at architecture and art styles. One of those design trends in early 2021 was to launch highly inflationary tokens and then use high APR numbers to encourage people to buy the token and stake it for rewards. This was basically just a new type of casino. Your net worth would go down even as the number of tokens you hold went up 10x a year. This was basically preying on the ignorance of users who didn't really understand finance but it worked for a time while the profit the hype generated was able to expand the user base faster than the inflation rate. Once the model ran out of users to expand to the rest was history.[1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/olympus)[2](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/klima-dao)[3](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alchemix)[4](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tokemak) Whenever you see a high APR in some LP or staking pool you need to slow down and investigate where the money is coming from. If it's coming from inflation you need to understand that *inflation is not profit*.\n\n*If It's Good Enough For a Screenshot, Take Profit*\n\nAs volatile as crypto is there will come a time where you are massively up. You'll be up so much you will be in disbelief. You will refresh your portfolio checker every 15 minutes and the person sitting across the table from you will know you're doing it again because the green from the screen will reflect from your eyes. At this point, they will think you have a problem. At this point you actually do have a problem but that's besides the point. Here's the thing: you aren't a genius. Even if you actually are a genius you aren't up because you are a genius. It's just that time of the cycle.\n\nAt that time of the cycle everything you'll see in your media feed will reinforce how much of a genius you are. It's like the whole world just woke up and finally saw what you saw first. However, if you haven't heard this yet let me be the first to tell you: **sentiment follow price**. People love the investment now because it is up. If the price wasn't up, you'd still be waiting like you were when you first bought. 90% of those investments everyone seems to agree can't possibly fail are destined for the dustbin of history. Ever heard of Feathercoin? If you were around at the time you couldn't not hear about it. How about EOS? OmiseGo? Luna? None of these things are going to be top 100 again. When prices are up, everyone is a genius. At the end of the cycle when you're holding the bag you won't feel like it any more.\n\nHow will you know when the top is? If there was a numeric answer to that then we'd all just sell then and the top would come sooner. The game theory of that makes the price chart look highly chaotic at the tops. The best answer I can give you having lived through some unbelievable peaks and valleys is *if it's good enough for a screenshot, take profit*.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The next section of my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1dcdm7q/daily_general_discussion_june_10_2024/l8168fk/\">Rabbit Hole Explorer&#39;s Guide</a> is all about managing risk.</p>\n\n<p><em>Don&#39;t Invest More Than You Can Afford to Lose</em></p>\n\n<p>Crypto is full of amazing heights and soul-crushing lows.

Seriously, I know people who have and it&#39;s so much more brutal than the 80% bear market crash because you know you could&#39;ve and should&#39;ve made it if you just took profits off for every taxable event.</p>\n\n<p>This cycle I&#39;ve been cashing out all of my airdrops into cash and holding it aside for this year&#39;s tax bill. Maybe you take a 30% cut from every taxable event you make and hold it aside. Find a plan which works for you.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re reading this and you know it applies to you, stop telling yourself you&#39;ll do it and actually do it. Reach out to your tax accountant or do the taxes yourself and figure out how much you&#39;ll need to pay and execute a plan to be ready for it.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously. Do it. It might just save your stack.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-18 20:22:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lnudjz8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fjkzpm","parent_id":"t1_lnt7p9q","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Gumpa-Bucky","body":"This.

In this post, I'll concentrate on proof of identity aspect of voting. Proof of identity is a stronger guaranty than [proof of personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood).\n\nI've been intrigued in leveraging government issued documents as a proof of identity for a while. Yes, government issued.  Blasphemy! First of all, I've been disappointed with current web3 approaches to proof of identity. Ones based on monetary incentives - \u201cIf the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.\u201d Social recovery - not that I delved too deep - seems gameable. Dedicated piece of hardware to scan biometric features - maybe. Think about it, which entities have always had the problem with uniquely identifying a person? Who are the incumbent identity providers? Governments, banks, and lately IT companies like Google, Twitter, FB...(\"Sign in with Google\"...).\n\nRight of the bat, IT company's proof of identity is shit. You can easily sibyl it. Banks - much beater. Having a bank card pretty much means you are a person or a legal entity and not a bot. Nobody can take your money if they don't scam you. Thing is, banks rely on government issued documents. Who caries the burden of identifying a person from the moment they are born? Can they enroll in a school? Can they cross a border? Did they pay taxes? Are the eligible for health care? Important stuff, right? Governments have been doing this for a long time. They have institutions on institutions for making sure that you are who you say you are. The world works thanks to them having done a decent job.\n\nAs we enter the third millennium, machine readable government documents have become a thing. Biometric passports are standardized ([ICAO Doc 9303](https://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303)). Almost [all the countries in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport#List_of_biometric_passports) now issue passports compliant with this protocol. \n\nRarimo developed the [Freedom tool](https://freedomtool.org/#/) - opensource, ZK powered, mobile app which scans your passport and creates a user profile. It claims to preserve authenticity, eligibility, anonymity and uniqueness. The [whitepaper](https://freedomtool.org/#/doc) addressed security claims and assumptions.\n\nThanks to ZK proofs, you could prove claims about yourself, without giving away unnecessary  personal information. You could prove that you are of legal age, without giving away any other info, including your identity. Are you a resident of certain country? Are you human and not a bot? \n\nProper digital identity unlocks a lot of applications web3 people have been talking about: voting, reputation systems, user profiles, social networks...These are the use cases which cannot be tackled with crypto-economics alone.

It certainly does not feel like it deserves it, but the world&#39;s not fair.</p>\n\n<p>It does seem insane that the Bitcoin ecosystem can absorb a billion dollars of new BTC every single month, while the Ethereum ecosystem is freaking out with marginal inflation (coming in from its current holders, too). Not to mention Solana&#39;s inflation. Maybe it&#39;s because we don&#39;t have a crazy billionaire buying hundreds of millions of USD every couple of weeks and hyping the coin. Or maybe it&#39;s because absolutely nothing matters in investing but narratives, and we have been obliterated on that front. Or maybe the mining cartels would never let a coin abandon PoW and be a success.</p>\n\n<p>I would say that I still think that October could turn sentiment around <em>really</em> fast, but this might be early, because I see a lot of complaining, but not a lot of people <em>actually</em> capitulating. A lot of comments seem to think that 15k is still just a matter of time. Maybe the market is waiting for some of you to actually sell.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, whatever happens, happens.I hope actual real world use cases arrive, that would be nice. I&#39;m mainly waiting for actual tokenization on-chain, mainly for stocks. The new EVE Online game also sounds like a great trial for blockchain gaming.  Actual, legit use-cases that could turn everything around. Because, if we are being honest, Eigenlayer and the whole points shenanigans added very little to zero value into the real world.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-18 06:29:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lnqb9wm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fjkzpm","parent_id":"t3_1fjkzpm","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/HauntedJockStrap88","body":"The \u201ccatalyst\u201d for ETH appreciation is happening all the time and it\u2019s the same it\u2019s always been- adoption.

The conventional advice is to sell all airdrops, as they usually underperform ETH... though I assume in bull markets they outperform during a certain time range. Actually, looking at relatively recent airdrops (June, as I don't know of more recent major ones), I see a mixed bag: Taiko up in ETH, zkSync down, LayerZero up, Azuro slightly up, and Blast down. \n\nI've been selling my airdrops, but I thought EigenLayer was different, and that it would be the one airdrop that I would keep. I thought its idea was amazing.
