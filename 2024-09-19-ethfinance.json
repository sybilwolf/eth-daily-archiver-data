To be honest this is a perfect environment for blockchains. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a video about what is known until now it is rather neutral/positive on the blockchain part of the game: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsU7Qa4PLdA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsU7Qa4PLdA</a></p>\n\n<p>Generally CCP, the game producer, does not have the best track record for spin off games.

To understand Tokemak v2 in context, it's probably helpful to understand how v1 worked.\n\nTokemak v1 was a set of contracts where folks could deposit tokens (i.e., approved assets) and earn rewards on those deposited assets in the form of TOKE (the protocol's governance token). What was neat and novelish about TOKE at the time was that it conferred liquidity direction rights (LDRs). Using TOKE, one could direct the liquidity deposited on the platform towards venues that reflected governance participants' desires. This was pretty inline with the curve wars meta at the time, and the bullish case for TOKE was broadly aligned with dapps/daos hoarding TOKE to control as much of the LDR share on tokens deposited on the platform as possible. This narrative had wings for a second; you can look at the price of TOKE and see that it once traded as high as $70 - it's now trading at less than a dollar. \n\nv2 is different (neater, imo, but I also thought v1 was neat, so fool me once etc. etc.) - The team demonstrated that they could build secure / robust contracts with v1 that interoperated with other dapps. To the best of my knowledge the project was never exploited, and they always were able to get time with solid audit shops / competitions (e.g., Halbern, Sherlock). I feel like this is the competency that they proved with v1, and v2 leverages that competency to abstract the complexity and sophistication associated with providing liquidity (i.e., being an LP) for various assets across defi. \n\nHistorically, providing liquidity has been a fool's errand for the average LP - you'll see headlines like \"Half of Uniswap v3 Users Lose Money\" etc. Being a profitable LP is hard, and at small size you'll fall victim to losses in the form of transaction fees or IL (if you manage to operate with enough size to minimize  the relative impact of fees, you need to be sophisticated and automated at scale to not lose to IL over time, particularly across a basket of assets). \n\nEnter v2, and the \"problem\" v2 is trying to solve: put the tokens you are willing to LP with and hope to earn rewards with via the provision of liquidity on \"autopilot\" - let the system (via it's contracts, integrations, automated logic, and scale) automate the provision of your liquidity and the collection of rewards associated with the provision of your liquidity on your behalf. The system's automated rebalancing and liquidation contracts will handle finding the highest rewards venue for you, and automatically convert the rewards tokens earned by providing liquidity in those venues back into the pool. \n\nHaving worked on attempts to build systems that automagically convert a shitcoin into a more durable token like ETH in a way that passes a legal team's bar in the past, I'm super impressed with this team's implementation (see https://docs.tokemak.xyz/developer-docs/contracts-overview/autopool-eth-contracts-overview/autopilot-contracts-and-systems/liquidation the liquidationRow contract here, specifically). They system will also handle the conversion of assets that you want to deposit into the system (e.g., LRTs, LSTs, wETH, etc.) into the underlying pool asset - v convenient.\n\nThe deployment of \"Autopools\" is permissioned atm (i.e., team builds them), but the architecture and vision outlined in the docs suggests that they're looking towards permissionless pool deployment in the future. \n\nWhere's the TOKE token figure into things now? Looks like more detail is on the way here, but as far as I can gather, you earn both pool rewards (paid out in the underlying pool asset) and TOKE in exchange for depositing today (points... you also earn some glorious points, or at least, there's a graphic that says points, don't points excite you? - note that points here reflect an estimate of the value associated with the points from other protocols' points, not tokemak points, which aren't a thing). Stake your position again to earn add'l TOKE. Any TOKE that you stake entitles you to a share of the ETH rewards generated by the system (well, atm, only the autoETH pool, but I'm sure eventually the system at large).\n\nI'm excited about the automated conversion component of this system. It's like an octopus that extends its tentacles across defi to deploy assets, and it scoops the shitcoins generated via that tentacle proliferation into its mouth and poops out ETH. You expose yourself to multiple layers of smart contract risk via the usage of a system like this (across the Tokemak contracts, the token contracts for the assets a pool is composed of, and the contracts of other projects where liquidity is deployed), so it's IMO up the risk curve, but it's neat to see a novel onchain app, imo.\n\nLast thing I'll say is that the team is razor sharp, and I've been impressed by their resilience; v1 was a bit of a bust, but they've just kept building throughout it all and now they're shipping again. This + 0 loss of user funds track record & getting a complex system by solid audit shops' processes has me impressed. I think that there's PMF for folks (like me) who have liquidity that they would love to provide, but doubt their own abilities to overcome IL / fees if they do it solo. \n\nEven if you don't like the dapp, they have a v1 merch store with some products that I think are neat, and if you use the discount code you can get a hat / shirt for like $2 (~92% off, same value that their token dropped over a 52WMA). \n\nWhat do y'all think? Definitely harkens back a bit, imo, to some of the \"innovation\" that we saw building on top of Curve, Convex, Frax, Butterfly, etc., but with a new twist (e.g., earn in ETH + shitcoin vs. just shitcoin).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hearing the call for more dApp discussion in the Daily, I&#39;ll kick things off with Tokemak v2 (aka Tokemak Autopilot). To understand Tokemak v2 in context, it&#39;s probably helpful to understand how v1 worked.</p>\n\n<p>Tokemak v1 was a set of contracts where folks could deposit tokens (i.e., approved assets) and earn rewards on those deposited assets in the form of TOKE (the protocol&#39;s governance token). What was neat and novelish about TOKE at the time was that it conferred liquidity direction rights (LDRs). Using TOKE, one could direct the liquidity deposited on the platform towards venues that reflected governance participants&#39; desires. This was pretty inline with the curve wars meta at the time, and the bullish case for TOKE was broadly aligned with dapps/daos hoarding TOKE to control as much of the LDR share on tokens deposited on the platform as possible. This narrative had wings for a second; you can look at the price of TOKE and see that it once traded as high as $70 - it&#39;s now trading at less than a dollar. </p>\n\n<p>v2 is different (neater, imo, but I also thought v1 was neat, so fool me once etc. etc.) - The team demonstrated that they could build secure / robust contracts with v1 that interoperated with other dapps. To the best of my knowledge the project was never exploited, and they always were able to get time with solid audit shops / competitions (e.g., Halbern, Sherlock). I feel like this is the competency that they proved with v1, and v2 leverages that competency to abstract the complexity and sophistication associated with providing liquidity (i.e., being an LP) for various assets across defi. </p>\n\n<p>Historically, providing liquidity has been a fool&#39;s errand for the average LP - you&#39;ll see headlines like &quot;Half of Uniswap v3 Users Lose Money&quot; etc. Being a profitable LP is hard, and at small size you&#39;ll fall victim to losses in the form of transaction fees or IL (if you manage to operate with enough size to minimize  the relative impact of fees, you need to be sophisticated and automated at scale to not lose to IL over time, particularly across a basket of assets). </p>\n\n<p>Enter v2, and the &quot;problem&quot; v2 is trying to solve: put the tokens you are willing to LP with and hope to earn rewards with via the provision of liquidity on &quot;autopilot&quot; - let the system (via it&#39;s contracts, integrations, automated logic, and scale) automate the provision of your liquidity and the collection of rewards associated with the provision of your liquidity on your behalf. The system&#39;s automated rebalancing and liquidation contracts will handle finding the highest rewards venue for you, and automatically convert the rewards tokens earned by providing liquidity in those venues back into the pool. </p>\n\n<p>Having worked on attempts to build systems that automagically convert a shitcoin into a more durable token like ETH in a way that passes a legal team&#39;s bar in the past, I&#39;m super impressed with this team&#39;s implementation (see <a href=\"https://docs.tokemak.xyz/developer-docs/contracts-overview/autopool-eth-contracts-overview/autopilot-contracts-and-systems/liquidation\">https://docs.tokemak.xyz/developer-docs/contracts-overview/autopool-eth-contracts-overview/autopilot-contracts-and-systems/liquidation</a> the liquidationRow contract here, specifically). They system will also handle the conversion of assets that you want to deposit into the system (e.g., LRTs, LSTs, wETH, etc.) into the underlying pool asset - v convenient.</p>\n\n<p>The deployment of &quot;Autopools&quot; is permissioned atm (i.e., team builds them), but the architecture and vision outlined in the docs suggests that they&#39;re looking towards permissionless pool deployment in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Where&#39;s the TOKE token figure into things now? Looks like more detail is on the way here, but as far as I can gather, you earn both pool rewards (paid out in the underlying pool asset) and TOKE in exchange for depositing today (points... you also earn some glorious points, or at least, there&#39;s a graphic that says points, don&#39;t points excite you? - note that points here reflect an estimate of the value associated with the points from other protocols&#39; points, not tokemak points, which aren&#39;t a thing).
