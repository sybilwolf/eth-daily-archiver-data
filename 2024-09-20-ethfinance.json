How did you end up getting into crypto and then into EVMavericks?**\n\nMy first exposure to crypto was way back in 2013! I was seeing a lot of hype on Reddit about Dogecoin, and had no idea how to get any. There was a trading subreddit and I swapped some of my World of Warcraft gold for some Dogecoin. Before I knew it I was mining for Dogecoin, and exploring the rest of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nAfter a few years of losing money trading memecoins, Ethereum suddenly rose to the top of the charts on Poloniex, an exchange mostly known for memecoins. I started looking into it and learning more. From there I ended up finding EthTrader, followed by EthFinance, and eventually received an EVMavericks airdrop for my participation in the community.\n\n**Oh, so you go a way back! And it's nice to hear that you are an OG receptor of your EVMaverick. Now looking ahead, what are you most excited about in the crypto space?**\n\nThe thing that excites me most is the Ethereum vision to disrupt and decentralise finance.\n\nMost of the traditional finance industry currently runs on 30+ year old software. None of those old systems really talk to each other, they don't properly integrate with the web, and they are entirely opaque. We just have to \"trust\" that our banks have the money they say they do. Ethereum is an open protocol that can be used by any individual or institution to store, transfer, invest, loan, borrow wealth, and crucially prove ownership.\n\nIt's hard for me to imagine a world where it doesn't become the default protocol for all of finance. It just works better than what's already out there. We have already scaled, and are pretty much ready, all that's lacking is the integrations and UI. Seeing that vision come to life over the years, and imagine what comes next is super exciting to me.\n\n**Great points and I'm excited to see that vision come to life as well! Now let's circle back to EVMavericks, what has been your favorite memory and what excites you going forward?**\n\nI have been amazed with the surprising real life overlap between this community and other areas of my life. Discovering an EVMaverick at the same music festival as me was certainly a highlight! I have my EVM as my Reddit profile image, and I'm always amazed to see it recognised in unusual corners of Reddit.\n\nI'm excited that I'm a part of one of the most strongly Ethereum aligned community there is. While I mostly only lurk these days, I love being able to check in with the community and keep up to date.\n\n**That's quite a surprise indeed! Now when it comes to EVMavericks, as far as I know, you have a pretty bullish outlook and have picked up additional lions, how has your thesis evolved? what do you wanna share with us about your strong conviction?**\n\nIt's pretty much just a leveraged bet on Ethereum. Because my conviction is so strong, I'm also convinced that anybody who was airdropped one of these is going to end up pretty wealthy a few years from now. And I think that being an EVM will be a pretty special part of that journey for them. In future, I can envision demand for joining this community to be high.\n\n**Let's switch gears for a bit, how do you usually spend time outside of crypto? what are your hobbies?**\n\nI'm a huge fan of dance music festivals, and normally try and get to 3 or 4 each year. I like travelling, theme parks, and rollercoasters too! On a regular week I can normally be found in a climbing gym, or watching Football (that's soccer to you burgers)\n\n**Any alpha or advice that you wanna share with us? It can be anything.**\n\nIn this space, you'll find a lot of advice about securing your financial independence, generational wealth, or other lofty goals. But many never get there. Don't forget to cash out the small wins and enhance your life right now, rather than always waiting for the \"next cycle\".\n\n**Lastly, is there anything else you wanna share with us, Sku? The stage is yours!**\n\nI know people are feeling a bit down with the ratio and all that. But we are right about Ethereum, we just need to be patient. Conviction bets work best, don't go chasing the hype.

There are some of them from the previous wave of DeFi (exchanges and trading platforms), so I&#39;m sure there will be plenty more popping up if restaking ends up being anything more than a passing fad.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-20 04:59:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lo1do1a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fl4c68","parent_id":"t1_lo19tj5","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haloooloolo","body":"Remember when everyone shit on Rocket Pool for not immediately jumping at the opportunity to integrate Eigenlayer?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Remember when everyone shit on Rocket Pool for not immediately jumping at the opportunity to integrate Eigenlayer?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-20 05:37:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lo1iyir","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fl4c68","parent_id":"t1_lo1do1a","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Itur_ad_Astra","body":"I'm going to pretend they did that on purpose, and not because RocketPool updates at glacial speeds.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m going to pretend they did that on purpose, and not because RocketPool updates at glacial speeds.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-20 05:41:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lo1jhdt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fl4c68","parent_id":"t1_lo1iyir","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haloooloolo","body":"I mean it was actively in discussion and shot down.
