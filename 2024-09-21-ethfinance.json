I am so grateful to be a part of this wonderful community and the doots won't die until this subreddit dies or I do... (unless Reddit nukes my account or something, but I'm sure I'd find a way around it though). Anyway, through the incredibly kind funding, raising 1.2 ETH from from u/superphiz, u/allinat40, u/haurog, u/alexiskef, u/shiftli, u/KuDeTa, u/Gumpa-Bucky, u/austonst and u/da3vr, I will absolutely be seeing you all in Phuket!\n\nAs a token of my appreciation I will be sending out a POAP soon (please DM me if you donated from a CEX or not your POAP wallet with your preferred wallet). I also have some ideas for a special something to give each of you in person (please let me know if any of you won't be at Hodlercon). Nothing big, but hopefully something meaningful, think of it like a physical POAP. No promises just yet but I've got an idea of something I may be able to do.\n\nI have already checked and I can definitely change my flight for minimal extra cost. I still need to figure out the logistics, ie can I fly out of Phuket to Aus/NZ or do I need to go back to Bangkok but it seems I can change my flight and get credit for another flight for no extra cost! This just leaves any extra cost for getting to Phuket, the Hodlercon ticket, accommodation, food and airport parking for an extra week. All of which I have no reason to believe will go over my newly increased budget.\n\nI also just want to say it was impressive/bold of you all to remember/have faith that tricky.eth was indeed my address. I have rarely mentioned that and it could've gone very wrong if you had the wrong address haha.\n\nFinally, I just want to say that this community never disappoints and all of the work being done around the doots now with the podcast is incredibly motivating for me. I love to see the awesome things coming to fruition out from this community and I hope this is just the beginning.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Oh my god you guys.

Let&#39;s have a closer look at it with an analogy.</p>\n\n<p>You are a future resident of a suburban city of San Francisco called X and want to know how fast you can reach your workplace by car. There are 10 possible connections with roughly the same distance with a speed limit of 80 miles per hour each. From now on there are two different perspectives:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;global&quot;: how many cars/hour are possible between X&#39;s home city and San Francisco?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;individual&quot;: how long does it take until X reaches San Francisco by car?</p>\n\n<p>Even though the &quot;global&quot; perspective is relevant for aspects like congestion the &quot;individual&quot; perspective is relevant, well, for the individual, the &quot;user&quot; of the &quot;network&quot; (streets).</p>\n\n<p>The global reference is based on the sum of all street throughputs while the individual reference is still limited by 80 miles/hour, no matter how many streets there are to connect X&#39;s home with his workplace.</p>\n\n<p>Just like with the 300 TPS. Yes, from a global perspective this is true but an individual, the user, simply doesn&#39;t need to care about this number! The end user just wants to know how much miles/hour (TPS) he can drive on a single street (single L2).</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that all those L2s aren&#39;t even pointing towards the same direction but slightly different ones (fragmentation) so it is even more important to consider L2s on an individual basis instead of a global one.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-21 00:35:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lo6d3re","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1flvgzu","parent_id":"t3_1flvgzu","score":-9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/eth10kIsFUD","body":"The amount of transactions an individual can get on a single L2 is not relevant for this metric. \n\nThe question is (very obviously) how many transactions can settle to Ethereum? **Ethereum is the only road we have**.
