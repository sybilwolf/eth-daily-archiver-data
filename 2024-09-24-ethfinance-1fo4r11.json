The title is a bit clickbaity with 'Is Cosmos Dead? A critical look with Zaki Manian'. But the content is just great. I love listening to non shilly people from other ecosystems and telling the story from their view. They go over the inception of the cosmos ecosystem which is based on sovereign L1 chains connected by IBC (inter-blockchain communication) bridges. This fragmentation was and is an issue for them also from the development point of view, as everyone just works on their own stuff with very little interaction. It sounds like they never had a common ground and as soon as there was a contentious issue people just left and did their own thing on their sovereign L1 (with blackjack and hookers). This fragmentation of people lead to critical vulnerabilities in some protocols like the IBC. \n\nThey shortly go over the Terra Luna collapse, which more or less killed all the TVL in the Cosmos ecosystem and many cosmos users lost a lot of money.\n\nThen, last summer things got interesting again with the modular blockchain thesis, the first restaking protocol starting on Cosmos, yes, they did it first, and the TIA airdrop which made quite a few cosmos stakers very rich. Everyone wanted to build the next TIA L1. As everywhere, the airdrop season got killed by ever increasing airdrop requirements and sybillors.\n\nIf you think this summer the Ethereum vibes have been bad, it sounds like cosmos was hit worse. Most people realised that the intial Cosmos coin called ATOM does not have any value in the cosmos ecosystem and just gets diluted by the miriads of new L1 tokens which connect to the Cosmos universe. But dont give any value back. They also had a 2nd Terra Luna fallout a few months ago which was due to a hack of the Terra blockchain bridge, which lead to a lot of bad press and triggered a lot of PTSD in the cosmos ecosystem again. Yes, I am as surprised as you that the Terra L1 still exists. \n\nThey then go over the general fragmentation of the space and the problem of the validators which now mostly consist of large entities like Exchanges, VCs or weird unknown legal constructs no one really knows who it is. Most community run validators at least on Cosmos have been marginalized by these large entities These large entities do not seem to have any interest in getting things back on track which makes it very difficult to fix some of the issues. As they either do not participate in voting at all (Exchanges) or try to optimize for different outcomes (rest).\n\nHe also makes parallels to problems which could hit the Ethereum space with fragmentation of EF people which now also act as advisors for large well funded projects. This according to him is how the issues of fragmentation of people started in the cosmos ecosystem. They did not really have to find a common ground anymore because people got paid enough in these other projects and just left, made their sovereign chain and continued to do their own stuff without much coordination\n\nNot sure if I agree that Ethereum has this issue at the moment but it is definitely interesting to think about. And it also makes one appreciate the feat the EF managed to achieve by coordinating, but not top down managing Ethereum.\n\nI always hold the cosmos ecosystem in high esteem because I like their vision of sovereignity. There rarely are obnoxious shills and they generally just seem to like building stuff. I just think it is not a very good approach to build something bigger together. With this interview I even have more respect for at least some cosmos builders, but I am also getting validated in my critical outlook on the cosmos ecosystem as a whole.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The newest ZK podcast (#340) with Zaki Manian was amazing to listen to: <a href=\"https://zeroknowledge.fm/340-2/\">https://zeroknowledge.fm/340-2/</a>  </p>\n\n<p>He is a Cosmos dev and worked on the IBC protocol (their bridge) and now works on a few cosmos projects also as an adviser.

I am not yet done, but one thing caught my attention: I think we discussed centralized sequencers here probably years ago and pointed out that these aren't perfect, but that we expect some L2s to have only one sequencer that will do all the work and that there will be some decentralized L2s. My mental model from these discussions was \"there will be a bit of everything\". \n\nMike yesterday basically said that he expects \"all\" (most) L2s to have a decentralized sequencer **and** that it is the best strategy for them, because they won't be more decentralized than L1, inherit all the necessary properties from l1 and shouldn't even try emphasize that dimension. His conclusion is more or less that real-time censorship resistance is cool (which is the result of decentralized sequencing), but it's probably not as important with the possibility of forced inclusion via L1. \n\nIs a decentralized sequencer only important in our bubble? The more I think about, the more I believe it is - and we are a niche, so developing for us and similar users might be good enough for one or two L2s, but that's it.

My understanding is as follows: There is no sequencer involved in this. You publish your transaction on Mainnet and interact with the smart contract of the rollup. If you asked for an exit you have to wait for the challenge period to end and afterwards you can recover your funds. I am not sure how an arbitrary tx will work. I think technically it should be possible without the sequencer being involved. The sequencer just has to also follow the direct interactions with the contract on Mainnet.

Purely from a monetary point of view there is an incentive to keep sequencing your own chain.

The base fees will in my understanding always go to the place the project behind the Rollup wants. In contrast to Ethereum Mainnet this base fee is not burned on the rollup. There is no way a sequencer can steal this base fee. A 3rd party sequencer can only harvest the priority fees. Currently the base fee is pretty much nothing on rollups because they have almost infinite block space. As soon as we hit a ceiling base fee will go up then most of the revenue will stay wherever the projects wants even though they would open up sequencing to 3rd parties. On Ethereum for example about 75%-95% of the fees are base fees and they are all burned. On rollups they would go to wherever coinbase or the Arbitrum DAO wants.\n\nThe second point is the organizational structure. Arbitrum does not control the fee revenue it is the DAO. Sure DAOs can be very disfunctional and captured by large players. But it is different than a publicly shareholder oriented company controlling the flows. I am not sure how it works for OP Mainnet or zksync. Coinbase definitely is a dangerous actor in that regard. But the last 1-2 years have shown that they are also very much aligned.

Permissionless or decentralized sequencing is mostly for censorship resistance. For the safety of your assets exit hatches and publishing data in blobs is pretty much what you need.
