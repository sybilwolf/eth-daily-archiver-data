You can expect the median fee to be around 0.01 USD, this will typically land the average fee a tad higher (0.03-0.05 USD). Why 0.01 USD for the median fee? Because humans are not price sensitive below that point. When fees are much lower than that humans will prefer to pay a premium for convenience. So the typical fee a human is willing to pay will sit around that, and if it sits any lower we will consume extra blobspace to make our life&#39;s easier</p>\n\n<p>128 blobs ~ 20000 tps</p>\n\n<p>0.05 USD per transaction -&gt; 1000 USD per second of L2 revenues</p>\n\n<p>1000 USD per second x 60 x 60 x 24 ~ 90000000 USD per day of L2 revenues</p>\n\n<p>50% value capture of L2 revenues ~ 50000000 USD per day of blob burn</p>\n\n<p>We are issuing around 2600 ETH per day. With the above values, blob fee burn would be giving 20000 USD in value to ETH. As at that price all issuance would be consumed by blob burn. Meaning, at any lower price blob fee burn makes ETH deflationary, and therefore a yield producing asset for holders.</p>\n\n<p>This is how L2s gives value to ETH. Without the ability to sell super-compressed blobspace we would never be able to get to those valuations because the average transaction fee would need to be extremely high! And remember that on top of that you have the premium L1 blockspace that will contribute its own chunk.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-26 10:01:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lp1q28s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fpojgj","parent_id":"t1_lp18qcv","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"Trying to follow your calculation, where did the 128 blobs come from?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Trying to follow your calculation, where did the 128 blobs come from?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-26 11:10:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lp23est","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fpojgj","parent_id":"t1_lp1q28s","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pa7x1","body":"Max value of blobs with PeerDAS based on what I have heard/read.
