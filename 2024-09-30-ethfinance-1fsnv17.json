gang! I come with HUGE news from Rocket Pool Land today.\n\nAs you might know, a few months ago, the Rocket Pool community voted to make the Saturn 1 & 2 updates the official road map of the RP protocol. Sadly, we're still up to 9 months away from Saturn 1. One of the things that Saturn will do is allow direct value capture for the RPL token. However, this value capture is maximized when RP TVL is as high as possible. \n\nFor the last few months, the community has been working on an idea that should massively boost TVL. Today, the RP community is starting to vote on what we're calling \"Saturn 0\". Saturn 0, AKA RPIP-62, is 2 changes that are being voted on. **The first is to allow people to stake with Rocket Pool using only ETH** - no more RPL will be needed! **The second is the removal of the 10% cliff for RPL rewards**. This means that if you're already staking with RP and your RPL is below 10%, you will start getting RPL rewards again. The result of this should be an influx of people who want to stake with ETH only and fewer existing node operators leaving\n\nIf you choose to stake with ETH only, you will get 10% commission from the protocol rETH. The more RPL you stake, the higher your ETH commission - maxing out at 14%. These parameters have been set to facilitate the conversion from Saturn 0 validators to Saturn 1 validators when the time comes. By staking with Rocket Pool after Saturn 0, **you will get 1.3x solo staking rewards**. We're setting the rewards here to have best alignment with Saturn 1. \n\nAlong with Saturn 0, RPIP-63 is also up for vote. This vote is a batched vote for bug fixes introduced in the recent Houston upgrade, and it gives the protocol the ability to change parameters to make RPIP-62 possible. \n\nWhen Saturn 0 is coupled with the upcoming Constellation product from NodeSet and Gravita, the near future is very bright for Rocket Pool. The community and external teams are working on what we think are the best ways to help Rocket Pool grow again. The deposit pool being maxed out should be cleared very quickly. \n\nSo, you might be wondering when all this will happen. Saturn 0 is being voted on starting today, and the vote will last 2 weeks. If the votes pass, **the parameters to enable ETH only validators are targeted to go live on Oct 24th.** For once, the RP community and team are actually moving quickly and making things happen. Constellation should be launching during that same period too. \n\nRocket Pool's revenge arc is starting now, and this is the most excited I have ever been for RP. \n\nA huge huge huge shoutout goes to Haloooloolo for spearheading this whole campaign and working with the community, team, and other projects to explain why this is a vital step for Rocket Pool now.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hello gang!

I feel like I've been able to predict all the major tech trends from the last 25 years, whether it was operating systems, search engines, cloud computing, weed stocks, EVs, crypto, or AI. Right now, for the first time in a long time, I just don't know.\n\nAI, at least at the startup stage, is clearly in a bubble. I strongly believe in the transformative power of AI but it's already had its 10x recently and random VC investments I'm reviewing are raising $100M just for mentioning AI. Do you honestly expect NVDA to do *another* 10x from here? You can buy MSFT and just sit on it or something broad spectrum like VTI and probably make your 8% a year but that's not a play for risk-seeking capital like all these other bets have been. Gold's been having a great run with nation states trying to de-dollarize and basically rotating US bond reserves into precious metal reserves but even if I'm up like 40% there it's just *boring* and I don't see a future in it outside of the current run. Maybe I need to look into emerging markets? Maybe there just is no 1000% tech investment to be found right now and I just need to stay informed, preserve capital, and wait? In the meantime I'm just parked barbell style in liquidity farming and working the fiat mines but it increasingly feels like if I'm not making 10% a year on my whole portfolio I'll be falling behind to inflation let alone able to live off my assets.\n\nI feel like I have enough most people would consider me wealthy but increasingly capital is the only thing that will make money in the world while the supply and demand of human labor will be increasingly out of balance as AI accelerates. Child care costs over $2k a month while the employees watch 8 kids each and make like $10-15/hr. Universities put students hundreds of thousands into student debt yet lecturers are working multiple jobs to get by. The medical industry and end of life care is going to systemically drain all the boomers wealth before it passes down but the caretakers of those facilities are overworked and couldn't afford a room at the facilities they work at. All of our services seem to cost astronomical amounts compared to pre-covid but the people doing the work aren't making that. So who is? Capital.\n\nYou can see what's happening to the 98% of people already left behind. Now add in AI displacing tens of millions of jobs over the next decade. As is the nature of automation, it will replace labor with profits to AI companies but a 10/1 ratio. I once led a team of AI engineers that was automating the jobs of 200 workers at $15 an hour per engineer per year. The software was considered a depreciating asset with a three year shelf life so we were considered to be making $18M in savings per engineer per year. That was 6 years ago; the technology is much more powerful now.\n\nI feel like there's this metaphorical wave I need to catch and I'm just behind the crest of it working hard to get on top of it so I can let the water do the work instead of me padding the whole way. The fear of being left behind keeps me motivated but it's not a happy mindset.
