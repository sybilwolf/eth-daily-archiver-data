Timing games aren't a good thing in general: they're zero-sum for proposers and basically negative-sum when you consider the impact on network health.

But when you accept a bid over mev-boost, *the relay*--with its well-connected clients and prime data center location--will be the one responsible for initial block propagation.\n\nIf you use mev-boost with relay-side timing games, the block may be delayed but you can trust the relay to propagate it fast. If you don't use mev-boost at all, your client will produce a block ASAP but you need to trust your own network to propagate it. The middle ground may be [more interesting](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1841214520896663887): mev-boost with timing games AND a `--min-bid` means you delay block production but may end up responsible for your own block propagation.\n\n*If you're a validator concerned about local propagation after delays*, you could specify `?headerDelay=0` in your Aestus mev-boost entry to disable timing games at the cost of lowering bid value, though if you're doing that, make sure to also *remove* Ultrasound and BloXroute relays from your list, as they also run timing games (BloXroute does allow for timing configuration, but I think you need to pay for their validator gateway service separately). There's no point in making Aestus return a bid early if your mev-boost client is just going to sit there waiting 900 ms for the other relays' responses.\n\n----\n\nI'm always happy to discuss.

I have nothing but the utmost respect for what you have been building in the last 2 years.\n\nA thought I had for a longer time now is the following. How difficult would it be to make an \"Ethereum Network Maxi\" relay as a smaller side relay with all the infrastructure you already have. This relay would only accept bids from builders which have a proven track record of not censoring transactions. Timing games would also be out of the question. The whole focus of this relay would be to be as good of a replacement of locally built blocks but with at least some MEV without some of the downsides. It would be a very opinionated relay. It would never be able to compete with the largest relays regarding rewards and it would only be able to cater to a small part of the Ethereum believers, because obviously you cannot connect to another relay as this would destroy the value proposition this relay would bring. Not sure it could ever get larger than 1% of the network. The interesting part might be that even though the relay would have a small share of the market it would be an exclusive relay. Some validators would only connect to this one and nothing else. If builders would want to catch a bid on a slot proposed from one of validators subscribed to only this relay they would have to make sure to have a non-censoring builder. At the beginning there would be fewer builders on this relay making it even more lucrative for the more sophisticated ones to jump on.

At the moment I connect to aestus, ultrasound relay and agnostic. Looking at the 'censorship.pics' site I will probably soon remove ultrasound relay. Too much censorship for my taste. Not horrible, but not good enough for me. The timing games are a further pain point which push me in the direction of starting to build all my blocks locally.

Objectively, whining about price is miserable behavior seeking the company of others.  But both this behavior and investment related suicides stem from individuals failing to understand their own risk tolerance and/or holding expectations that are misaligned to reality. </p>\n\n<p>And btw, this comes at a time of what appears to be entirely normal levels of volatility.  This isn&#39;t some black swan event.  This a 10% price drop over a week after a 13% price rise over the previous two weeks.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>No one is perfect, but please understand it\u2019s though to feel like you\u2019re doing the right thing 95% of the time and then get hammered on the 5% grey area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you really feel this way having been around for 40x (or more) price increase, then I think that 95% might be a little overstated.   But hey, I really don&#39;t know your situation.  Maybe you the universe has randomly aligned against you.  There are always statistical outliers.  In any case, change starts from within.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-03 12:16:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lq6n0fy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fu8i74","parent_id":"t1_lq65eju","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"I\u2019m not really sure I understand 95% reply\u2026 my point was that I feel like I\u2019m \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d in terms of what I post here.
