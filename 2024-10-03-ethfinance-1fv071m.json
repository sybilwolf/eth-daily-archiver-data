He sees a few places where there will be the most improvements in the next years.\n\n- Wallet tradeoffs and how multisigs, guardians and the combination with zkproofs have or will improve that space. This allows web2 UX with web3 robustness. \n\n- Social media where you actually own the account (warpcast).\n\n- Payment wallets which are getting close to venmo experience.\n\n- Privacy pools were you can proof to not be the bad guy without revealing who you are.

He talked about its possibilities but also spoke frankly about its limitations. Bittensor is one of the few crypto AI projects that actually has AI and is semi-decentralized (e.g. subnets have independent miners being checked by a set of independent validators). I haven't seen its project leader try to oversell the project, and that's something I wish more of the crypto community would try to do.\n\nThis is the opposite of what's been happening on the Fetch.ai and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance side, where it seems to be mostly marketing and shilling without a tangible crypto AI project.\n\n**Revisiting Fetch**\n\nSeveral months ago, I started investigating Fetch.ai and noticed in their documentation that their agents can't actually perform any AI or machine learning. They can link to (i.e. fetch) API request URIs for external AI projects in a similar sense to how ERC-721 NFTs can contain a TokenURI to an in-browser Doom game. (The main difference is that Fetch can also execute API request responses server-side instead of just client-side like with NFTs.) Despite this, every single media article and member of the Fetch community kept talking as if the project could perform AI-related functions.\n\nThis misconception that Fetch could perform AI was probably due to confusion caused by multiple factors including:\n\n1. Fetch's marketing and main website, which constantly refer to AI\n1. The lowercase \"ai\" in the \"Fetch.ai\" name\n1. The name of their agents, which they called \"AI Agents\" despite not implementing AI\n1. The laziness of media writers and investors, who never read or test developer documentation\n\nNo one had ever brought up this issue on the FetchAI_Community sub.\n\nAnyways, fast-forward 3 months. I checked their documentation again this week. At some point they stopped calling their agents \"AI Agents\", and rebranded them as \"Universal Agents\", which is less misleading than before. Though many parts of their main website still have references to \"AI Agents\".\n\nThe other part that I though was misleading about Fetch's marketing is that none of their uAgents are decentralized. They're each all hosted and executed on a **single node** in the same way as in AWS. There are 2 ways to host an agent:\n\n1. Locally on your own server, and only your server can execute the code. If your server is offline, so is the agent.\n2. On their centralized server, the AgentVerse, and they execute the code for you. As far as I could tell from the documentation, the AgentVerse is centrally controlled without a set of validators or any blockchain, just like AWS.\n\nOnly 1 other person on the sub besides me discovered that their premier DeltaV AI chat interface demo didn't work 3 months ago (and still doesn't work today).

Rumors abound TGE is soon. Scroll 1 year anniversary is coming up in mid October. Hints everywhere the eye can see.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of coming to you all with a cheeky smile and an airdrop nudge nudge wink wink, I am here hat in hand, on my knees, humbly begging for scraps of your attention.</p>\n\n<p>Please, kind sir, may you take a look at my dapp?</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a good dapp. I promise. Maybe.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote some about what it actually is here: <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/loiyaa.eth/SSbs_q0TyPyLLXJszUkIUtgP7OzIYQxKMNL30ak43C8\">Blog Link</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://contributors.loiyaa.com/\">Frontend Link</a></p>\n\n<p>In all seriousness, I find it incredible just how far you can get with AI. I didn&#39;t write any code here. All it takes is a bit of persistence. We&#39;re moving fast into a world where everyone can make their own toys exactly to their liking by chatting up a virtual assistant. If you have ideas you want to see happen and time to spend, there&#39;s very little to stop you.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-03 11:07:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lq69vwf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fv071m","parent_id":"t3_1fv071m","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"That is a fun little social experiment you built and the page looks great.
