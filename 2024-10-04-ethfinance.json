But sometimes there is a gem to be found. The recent coindesk article titled \"How North Korea Infiltrated the Crypto Industry\" is one of those: https://www.coi ndesk.com/tech/2024/10/02/how-north-korea-infiltrated-the-crypto-industry/\n\nThe article connects the dots from various independent investigations and famous hacks, adding additional interviews with projects founders to show that there is a large number of crypto projects which had, and some still have, North Korean IT workers on their payroll. They create fake persona fully with github history. To build up such a fake persona is quite a bit of work, which sometimes takes years. Sometimes the workers do their jobs well, other times they are only there for a few months to milk the payroll of the project before being fired for underperfomance. With their insider information and sometimes added malicious code, these workers hack the projects later on. But sometimes the fake persona they built is worth more than what they get from a hack as seen in the MISO hack a few years ago, where the North Korean devs returned the hacked funds. Apparently a person under the same name as the MISO hacker applied for another job in another project shortly after. \n\nIt is unclear if there is a single person behind such a persona or if a single person handles various fake identities. Sometimes these workers change their writing style and forget what was discussed just a few hours earlier, which is a clear indication that there is a whole team of people behind such a persona. It is also expected that some of these fake personas also work at several companies in parallel to maximize the income. This means that probably many fake identities are managed by a larger group of people.\n\nCoindesk states that North Korea earns around 600 million USD from IT workers on payroll in foreign countries. This figure is an estimate by the UN, covering all sectors of IT work not only crypto. Last year it was estimated that North Korea got about 700 million USD from hacking crypto projects, making these numbers pretty comparable. At peak in 2022 it was 1.7 billion through hacking though. Crypto is particularly vulnerable to these kinds of fake employee attacks, as pseudonymity is a virtue in our space, which makes it easier to create a fake persona. But this kind of fake personas applying for IT jobs also occurs in other sectors. The Darknet Diaries podcast from last year covers such a story: https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/133/ This is not an example of North Korean IT workers applying for a job, but rather companies hiring younger inexperienced workers and make them apply to jobs using a stolen identity. This is an indication, that 'normal' businesses are eyeing these opportunities and want to have a part of the cake as well.  \n\nI think overall this investigation shows how widespread this problem is. Aside from hacks it can become an issue for the projects themselves, as they are sending the salaries to sanctioned entities. The FBI is slow, but many projects where contacted by the FBI to provide more information about these unusual payments. No crypto projects have been penalized yet, as they are seen as victims as well, but I personally expect projects to be liable if they do not even do the most basic background checking. Besides the legal liability there is also the moral issue. Reports of working conditions for these North Korean employees do not sound very positive. In essence they are getting exploited. Projects paying someone in such a working condition are keeping this system alive.   \n\nIt was mentioned that improved and more professional background checking are necessary, as the forged documents they provide often look authentic. While it is nearly much impossible to filter out all these applications, raising the barrier can help. An additional deterrent can be to have a 'webcam is on' policy during calls as it makes it harder to hide a switched person that way.

But sometimes there is a gem to be found. The recent coindesk article titled &quot;How North Korea Infiltrated the Crypto Industry&quot; is one of those: <a href=\"https://www.coi\">https://www.coi</a> ndesk.com/tech/2024/10/02/how-north-korea-infiltrated-the-crypto-industry/</p>\n\n<p>The article connects the dots from various independent investigations and famous hacks, adding additional interviews with projects founders to show that there is a large number of crypto projects which had, and some still have, North Korean IT workers on their payroll. They create fake persona fully with github history. To build up such a fake persona is quite a bit of work, which sometimes takes years. Sometimes the workers do their jobs well, other times they are only there for a few months to milk the payroll of the project before being fired for underperfomance. With their insider information and sometimes added malicious code, these workers hack the projects later on. But sometimes the fake persona they built is worth more than what they get from a hack as seen in the MISO hack a few years ago, where the North Korean devs returned the hacked funds. Apparently a person under the same name as the MISO hacker applied for another job in another project shortly after. </p>\n\n<p>It is unclear if there is a single person behind such a persona or if a single person handles various fake identities.

Although, I had a few crypto names in the past, the one that really stuck with me, and the one I use for a few years now, is [whatthefuck.eth](https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2Ff984b34eabc80eb9137227ceb1e604f4.png&w=1200&q=75). Very proud I managed to grab this ENS to be honest. My EVMav is #658 and is currently chilling in my cold wallet along with other cool web3 things.\n\n**When and how did you get into crypto?**\n\nProbably not as early as other EVMavs. I started reading about crypto and getting interested in the tech around the summer of 2017 but I actually made my first purchase around the end of 2017, near the top of that bull cycle. The bear that followed didn't really discourage me at all. I kept investing and got into exploring the ecosystem more and more as time went by. Probably the reason that I got into crypto is similar to others, partly the realization of how disruptive this tech can be (and will be), and also the investing perspective which was always attractive to me.\n\n**How did you get into EVMavericks?**\n\nI followed the usual route through Reddit. First during the r/ethtrader times and then the switch to r/ethfinance. I still remember some of the drama and how the r/ethfinance folks clicked to me as super smart and helpful people that wanted to create a cool internet corner. I got involved in r/ethfinance more and more with posts and replies and eventually got \"airdropped\" my EVMav as a contributor to the subreddit.\n\n**How has your stay been in EVMavericks? Any favorite memories?**\n\nNeedless to say, the EVMavs group has been my internet home since the start of the discord. I get to hang out with people that I enjoy talking to, appreciate their perspectives, and are always willing to help for anything web3. As far as memories go, there's so many good ones to mention. The early degen-chat days where we dealt with lots of NFT mints and alpha. Chad NFTs, anyone? The Layer Zero game which was fun, if it wasn't for Rugsby. The chad-fund efforts which I'd love to revive at some point. The merge Pixel Party where we drew our EVMav logo on the canvas and had so much fun during the voice chat. The colonoscopy day POAPs! And last but not least, shoutout to HashtagFuzzMaster for giving one of his ducklings the name whattheduck. Pretty bad ass duckling! [Here's a picture!](https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F8eb946e0c71d65c40291c017b3131cf7.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\n**Earlier you said this tech can be really disruptive, what excites you the most about the space nowadays? And how do you usually spend your time in crypto?**\n\nI still get amazed by the fact that you can own and have full control, in a verifiable way, of assets or anything that can be tokenized really, and not have to worry about centralized entities. It does come with great responsibility of course. I think blockchain tech can and will disrupt many sectors eventually. One of the concepts and use cases that excites me a lot is the ability to own your digital identity and the development of social layer infrastructure. Definitely excited to see how this all plays out at the end and how it gets adopted. Now, on what I mostly do nowadays, I mostly trade lots of memes and have fun with the whole thing. On one side, I'd like to make profitable trades of course, but it also helps me discover little corners of the internet where people gather under one meme and really have fun with it. The internet and its culture can be a fairly amazing place.\n\n**The internet can be really an amazing place indeed. It sounds like you have been pretty active even during the bear times, what's the motivation behind it or, in other words, what kept you sane during the bear market? And what words of wisdom do you have for folks who experience this as their first bear cycle?**\n\nThat's a good question. I think it is different for each person. For me, what keeps me going is probably curiosity and also the fact that people keep building in this space. There's always something to explore, some new meta to invest in, etc. Hanging out in the EVMavs discord also helped me a lot to find out new things to check out. That's the good thing about this community. It has a bunch of curious and active people in the space, each interested and focused on their own niche. Anything from gamefi, memes, DeFi, etc. It really is a great community with good overall knowledge in the web3 space.\n\n**Let's hear about your IRL for a bit, how do you usually spend time outside of crypto? What are your hobbies?**\n\nI tend to have a busy schedule due to irl work, so not much time left for many other things. Really my major hobby is crypto and investing at this point. But other than that, I enjoy a few other things. Playing pool is a hobby of mine since I was 15 or so. Then my latest thing is taking care of about 60+ plants that my significant other and I have in our house. Lots of work there, but fun activity.\n\n**Any alpha or advice that you can give us? It can be anything.**\n\nI'd say take your time to learn how to evaluate the info you are receiving and also learn how to control and understand your feelings when trading. Whether that's greed, FUD, or FOMO, learn to recognize and act accordingly. That's not really alpha or anything new, but something that I think makes a big difference in crypto investing. I'm still learning myself how to master all that to be honest.\n\n**Lastly, is there anything else you want to share with us, Whatthefuck? The stage is yours!**\n\nNothing crazy. Just to sum it up, stay curious, engage in good communities, learn from others, and have fun along the way.\n\n----\n\n[Subscribe to our paragraph to get these interviews & more sooner](https://paragraph.xyz/@evmavericks)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F3ce3e00547cdc5f4b250ef64b12f2dca.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75\"><strong>Get to know EVMavericks #6</strong></a> - whatthefuck.eth aka EVM 658</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hi, what do you go by and what is your EVMavericks #?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hi, 696!

Lido tries everything to get people on board. If you are on their early adoption whitelist they even allow for a lower bond for the first share, increasing the rewards even further. As far as I see pretty much anyone running a node anywhere is on the list (20k-30k) addresses. They also are present pretty much everywhere to advertise the start of the CSM. As far as I see they limit the shares to 12 for each node operator, which means even under the most optimistic assumptions the amount of ETH the solo node operators will handle will be at most be in the single digit percentage of the whole validators Lido has. It is a good development, but will not change the validator distribution setup within Lido to any meaningful degree.\n\nOn a more personal opinion I try to stay as far away as possible from Lido as they have a massive war chest and a lot of influential people on their pay roll. They can undercut the competition for very long to make sure none other staking solution survives. Their initial plan of cross-subsidicing the CSM with revenue from their more centralized staking business was a pretty direct attack on the current solo staker landscape. Not sure of they changed this though. Their history of gaslighting the solo staker community and claiming them to be 'irrational actors' massively soured my opinion. They way they plan to centralize the Ethereum staking under their umbrella and even calling it decentralized, does not help in making me more sympathetic towards them. In the long run I think they are a massive problem for the Ethereum network and I really hope we can keep them from taking over the staking layer.\n\nThe sad reality is that there is very little decentralized competition. Rocketpool still is the only properly decentralized solution. They are much smaller, they are in the middle of a year long change in how much bond their stakers need. In a few weeks we might see the first rocketpool minipool without the need to stake RPL. They just have the first one running on testnet (as of 3 hours ago). I have great hopes that this will be competitive in the long run, but as always with rocketpool it will take some time. An interesting project is Nodeset which is planned to launch soon will be interesting to watch, it is built atop of rocketpool and adds a very soft kyc layer for node operators. Bonds are lower than with rocketpool and no RPL is needed. Another project called Diva which was all the rage last summer (2023) still does not have a fully functioning prototype. Their testnet stopped accepting new node operators after they found some bugs. We will see what will come out of it in months to come. Puffer might be interesting as well, but to be honest I have no idea about the details.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Financially for node operators it is a great product.

They way they plan to centralize the Ethereum staking under their umbrella and even calling it decentralized, does not help in making me more sympathetic towards them. In the long run I think they are a massive problem for the Ethereum network and I really hope we can keep them from taking over the staking layer.</p>\n\n<p>The sad reality is that there is very little decentralized competition. Rocketpool still is the only properly decentralized solution. They are much smaller, they are in the middle of a year long change in how much bond their stakers need. In a few weeks we might see the first rocketpool minipool without the need to stake RPL. They just have the first one running on testnet (as of 3 hours ago). I have great hopes that this will be competitive in the long run, but as always with rocketpool it will take some time. An interesting project is Nodeset which is planned to launch soon will be interesting to watch, it is built atop of rocketpool and adds a very soft kyc layer for node operators. Bonds are lower than with rocketpool and no RPL is needed. Another project called Diva which was all the rage last summer (2023) still does not have a fully functioning prototype. Their testnet stopped accepting new node operators after they found some bugs. We will see what will come out of it in months to come. Puffer might be interesting as well, but to be honest I have no idea about the details.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-04 02:25:22","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-10-04 05:47:44","id":"lq9wpa6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fvrhxr","parent_id":"t1_lq9td3a","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-04 02:37:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lq9xrvb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fvrhxr","parent_id":"t1_lq9wpa6","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"You are right stakewise is interesting.
