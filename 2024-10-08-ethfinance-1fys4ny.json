What would the effects be?\n\nCurrently, there isn't a single country that does full-reserve banking. It would greatly contract the economy, and most global companies, VC funding, and innovation would move elsewhere where they can get cheaper loans. It's self-sacrificing idea.\n\nHistorically, every country has been on a fractional reserve system since banks and loans existed. Banks can lend out a portion of their customer's deposits to use towards other people's loans. If too many loans defaulted or there were a bank run, the bank would close. Centralized reserves were then invented to handle mass bank runs during times of panic. And overall, strong central banks, when combined with the power to expand money supply, have been extremely successful in preventing mass bank runs. Keep in mind that strong central banks did not exist in the US before the 1940s.\n\nWhile depressions were extremely common and occurred about every 30 years post-feudalism and before central banks could expand money supply, there hasn't been one since central banks gained that power after the 1930s.\n\nThe Silver Standard, Gold Standard, Brent-Wood system, and Fiat systems all used fractional reserve banking. Of those systems, only fiat system could handle nation-wide full reserve banking.

What would the effects be?</p>\n\n<p>Currently, there isn&#39;t a single country that does full-reserve banking. It would greatly contract the economy, and most global companies, VC funding, and innovation would move elsewhere where they can get cheaper loans. It&#39;s self-sacrificing idea.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, every country has been on a fractional reserve system since banks and loans existed. Banks can lend out a portion of their customer&#39;s deposits to use towards other people&#39;s loans. If too many loans defaulted or there were a bank run, the bank would close. Centralized reserves were then invented to handle mass bank runs during times of panic. And overall, strong central banks, when combined with the power to expand money supply, have been extremely successful in preventing mass bank runs. Keep in mind that strong central banks did not exist in the US before the 1940s.</p>\n\n<p>While depressions were extremely common and occurred about every 30 years post-feudalism and before central banks could expand money supply, there hasn&#39;t been one since central banks gained that power after the 1930s.</p>\n\n<p>The Silver Standard, Gold Standard, Brent-Wood system, and Fiat systems all used fractional reserve banking.

Bitcoin devs are mostly volunteers BTW, there are devs that want to make bitcoin an L2 even. Again no one wants to hard fork and accept it, because they are so stubborn about the code never changes mentality. Even when it did in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Finishing Harvard or MIT means jack shit to me. He&#39;s just into bitcoin and is grifting it for his own gains. And he just happens to be a popular icon for many. There are other people in MIT who believe in Ethereum more for example who just are not as popular as him. You should stop basing your ideas around one person.</p>\n\n<p>We are not getting any money into spot or etf because smart money knows you can stake ETH for better yield. LIDO did not become a powerhouse from normal people like us. BTC does not have any of these things. So they have no choice other then spot or etfs.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-08 04:20:37","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-10-08 04:24:21","id":"lqx893i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fys4ny","parent_id":"t1_lqx5iqj","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"It\u2019s not a completely unfair question, since if we flip the script to something like climate change denial or flat earthers it\u2019s the same concept.
