Reputable crypto forums prohibit that for your safety. The blockchain is public unencrypted information. When you post precise positions and trade times you reveal your address to anyone looking. If I know your address I know not only your current net worth but everything you do in the future. You probably aren't intending to forfeit your financial privacy forever; it makes you a target. It enables more credible spear-phishing and tells the attacker whether you have enough funds to be worth their time. Generally speaking, just keep your crypto dealings private or at least relatively anonymous, especially online.\n\nThis is true among friends and family for different reasons. There will come a point in your learning where you discover something exciting in this rabbit hole, the whole thing clicks for you, and you become enthusiastic and want to share this with everyone around you. People around you then think you've joined a cult. It's more than a stereotype; I've seen it many times. Even outside of crypto it's usually recommended to avoid mixing business and pleasure. If someone listens to you and makes money they are rarely going to be grateful to you personally. If they listen and lose money you can easily damage relationships. So don't go shilling your favorite memecoin at your next holiday party with friends and family. As an investment of your energy it just doesn't provide a very good risk adjusted return.\n\nIn general, while I encourage everyone to talk about what blockchains can do and the benefits they bring, don't talk your bags.  It's one thing to have an conversation about money being a social construct or the outrageous quicks of the banking system. It's quite another to go around making grandiose claims you don't have the means to back up in the moment while telling everyone to buy whatever coin/token you're currently obsessed with. Don't be that annoying guy. If you absolutely can't resist or are obligated to answer because someone directly asks you I recommend you approach the topic like [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oz-XUF1EM&ab_channel=Bankless). Your first objective is to dispel misconceptions and ask confounding questions that lead to thought experiments that the person might actually benefit from. [Be Socratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method). In my experience, the moment a listener perceives even an inkling of self-interest in the topic you will just be another scammer to them. Don't talk your bags, your *crypto is private*.\n\n**Real Help Will Be Public**\n\nGiven how overwhelmed you might feel at times when exploring something new it's natural that you want to reach out and ask for help. If you do this in web3 on Discord, Twitter, or Reddit in most places the people who will respond to you, especially in DMs, are scammers. Your transaction failed trying to claim funds on whatever.finance? The scammers just see [this guy](https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Russell?file=Russell1.png). They can just *smell* the fresh blood. It's literally their job hunt people like you. *Legit people never DM you first*. They'd rather answer your question in public so the response is indexed for the next people who search.\n\nIf a DM is necessary they will tell you to DM them. Scammers can easily impersonate legit people on social media. If you're on Discord, they can DM you despite not even being on the server you're asking for help from and therefore they are out of reach of the moderators of that protocol. They can use the same image and public alias as the legit person you are talking to. If you're on Twitter they can use a subtly different name but have the same profile picture and pay $10 to have a blue checkmark next to their name. You'll sometimes get two or three different accounts messaging you telling you similar things to make the answer look more credible. The differences are easy to miss, you are frustrated even before they reach you and are willing to try something new to fix the problem, and they'll be readily available and eager to \"help\" you.\n\nNothing good will come from their help. They'll try to send you to their help server to file a ticket. They'll try to get you to install some custom wallet into your browser. They'll send you to a website that asks for your private key. They'll tell you there's some manual workaround they will do for you if you just send your ERC-20 to their treasury address. These are all obvious red flags but before you even get there the first red flag is you are using DMs at all. Whenever someone reaches out to you first with any type of directions, it's a red flag. *Real help will be public*.\n\n**Be Careful Who You Trust**\n\nLearning in this ecosystem can be frustrating at times. Everywhere you go everyone seems to know more than you about everything from macro economics, to how to read a chart and tell the future, an entire sailors dictionary of jargon from tradfi, to technical specifications of networks that you need a computer science degree to understand. It can all feel frustratingly out of reach but I'll let you in on a secret: most people worth listening to *are capable* of explaining things in simple enough terms that you can understand it. If you are on their platform and they have all the space and time they need to explain something well yet they aren't making the effort to explain it so you can understand it it could be their goal isn't to be understood by you but rather to sound credible and confident so that you buy whatever they are selling. If you stumble into a conversation between two names that have a lot of followers and they are talking way above your head, you are not yet at a place where it's worth reading whatever that is. If you're outmatched to the degree that you aren't prepared to sus out bullshit you shouldn't be considering buying whatever anyone there is selling.\n\nGenerally speaking, your favorite crypto influencer is using you as exit liquidity. If you aren't paying for a product, *you are the product*. If you can't figure out how they are monetizing your attention, you can still be certain they are. They are monetizing your attention in every way they can. They are getting paid for ad space. They are executing trades before you can so you're always buying at a higher price and selling at a lower price than them if you follow their moves. They need engagement numbers to raise more money from VCs and they need to sustain their token price to keep attention on their project. For all of the above, they need to retain your attention and they will use every cognitive bias at their disposal to do so. People often mistake confidence for aptitude. The loudest voices are those with the strongest incentives not those with the truth. But I will tell you this lesson from cycles past: the most boisterous sounding voices in the crowd have a storied history of imploding a year after you'll first discover them. *Be careful who you trust*.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The next section of my <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fjkzpm/daily_general_discussion_september_18_2024/lnt7p9q/\">Rabbit Hole Explorer&#39;s Guide</a> is all about crypto etiquette.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your Crypto is Private</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you go to stock trading forums you&#39;ll frequently find people posting pictures of their brokerage account positions showing they either made or lost incredible amounts of money. Reputable crypto forums prohibit that for your safety. The blockchain is public unencrypted information. When you post precise positions and trade times you reveal your address to anyone looking. If I know your address I know not only your current net worth but everything you do in the future. You probably aren&#39;t intending to forfeit your financial privacy forever; it makes you a target. It enables more credible spear-phishing and tells the attacker whether you have enough funds to be worth their time. Generally speaking, just keep your crypto dealings private or at least relatively anonymous, especially online.</p>\n\n<p>This is true among friends and family for different reasons. There will come a point in your learning where you discover something exciting in this rabbit hole, the whole thing clicks for you, and you become enthusiastic and want to share this with everyone around you. People around you then think you&#39;ve joined a cult. It&#39;s more than a stereotype; I&#39;ve seen it many times. Even outside of crypto it&#39;s usually recommended to avoid mixing business and pleasure. If someone listens to you and makes money they are rarely going to be grateful to you personally. If they listen and lose money you can easily damage relationships. So don&#39;t go shilling your favorite memecoin at your next holiday party with friends and family. As an investment of your energy it just doesn&#39;t provide a very good risk adjusted return.</p>\n\n<p>In general, while I encourage everyone to talk about what blockchains can do and the benefits they bring, don&#39;t talk your bags.  It&#39;s one thing to have an conversation about money being a social construct or the outrageous quicks of the banking system. It&#39;s quite another to go around making grandiose claims you don&#39;t have the means to back up in the moment while telling everyone to buy whatever coin/token you&#39;re currently obsessed with. Don&#39;t be that annoying guy. If you absolutely can&#39;t resist or are obligated to answer because someone directly asks you I recommend you approach the topic like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-oz-XUF1EM&amp;ab_channel=Bankless\">this guy</a>. Your first objective is to dispel misconceptions and ask confounding questions that lead to thought experiments that the person might actually benefit from. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method\">Be Socratic</a>. In my experience, the moment a listener perceives even an inkling of self-interest in the topic you will just be another scammer to them. Don&#39;t talk your bags, your <em>crypto is private</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Real Help Will Be Public</strong></p>\n\n<p>Given how overwhelmed you might feel at times when exploring something new it&#39;s natural that you want to reach out and ask for help. If you do this in web3 on Discord, Twitter, or Reddit in most places the people who will respond to you, especially in DMs, are scammers. Your transaction failed trying to claim funds on whatever.finance? The scammers just see <a href=\"https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Russell?file=Russell1.png\">this guy</a>. They can just <em>smell</em> the fresh blood. It&#39;s literally their job hunt people like you. <em>Legit people never DM you first</em>. They&#39;d rather answer your question in public so the response is indexed for the next people who search.</p>\n\n<p>If a DM is necessary they will tell you to DM them. Scammers can easily impersonate legit people on social media. If you&#39;re on Discord, they can DM you despite not even being on the server you&#39;re asking for help from and therefore they are out of reach of the moderators of that protocol. They can use the same image and public alias as the legit person you are talking to. If you&#39;re on Twitter they can use a subtly different name but have the same profile picture and pay $10 to have a blue checkmark next to their name. You&#39;ll sometimes get two or three different accounts messaging you telling you similar things to make the answer look more credible. The differences are easy to miss, you are frustrated even before they reach you and are willing to try something new to fix the problem, and they&#39;ll be readily available and eager to &quot;help&quot; you.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing good will come from their help. They&#39;ll try to send you to their help server to file a ticket. They&#39;ll try to get you to install some custom wallet into your browser. They&#39;ll send you to a website that asks for your private key. They&#39;ll tell you there&#39;s some manual workaround they will do for you if you just send your ERC-20 to their treasury address. These are all obvious red flags but before you even get there the first red flag is you are using DMs at all. Whenever someone reaches out to you first with any type of directions, it&#39;s a red flag. <em>Real help will be public</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Be Careful Who You Trust</strong></p>\n\n<p>Learning in this ecosystem can be frustrating at times. Everywhere you go everyone seems to know more than you about everything from macro economics, to how to read a chart and tell the future, an entire sailors dictionary of jargon from tradfi, to technical specifications of networks that you need a computer science degree to understand. It can all feel frustratingly out of reach but I&#39;ll let you in on a secret: most people worth listening to <em>are capable</em> of explaining things in simple enough terms that you can understand it. If you are on their platform and they have all the space and time they need to explain something well yet they aren&#39;t making the effort to explain it so you can understand it it could be their goal isn&#39;t to be understood by you but rather to sound credible and confident so that you buy whatever they are selling. If you stumble into a conversation between two names that have a lot of followers and they are talking way above your head, you are not yet at a place where it&#39;s worth reading whatever that is. If you&#39;re outmatched to the degree that you aren&#39;t prepared to sus out bullshit you shouldn&#39;t be considering buying whatever anyone there is selling.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, your favorite crypto influencer is using you as exit liquidity. If you aren&#39;t paying for a product, <em>you are the product</em>. If you can&#39;t figure out how they are monetizing your attention, you can still be certain they are. They are monetizing your attention in every way they can. They are getting paid for ad space. They are executing trades before you can so you&#39;re always buying at a higher price and selling at a lower price than them if you follow their moves. They need engagement numbers to raise more money from VCs and they need to sustain their token price to keep attention on their project. For all of the above, they need to retain your attention and they will use every cognitive bias at their disposal to do so. People often mistake confidence for aptitude. The loudest voices are those with the strongest incentives not those with the truth. But I will tell you this lesson from cycles past: the most boisterous sounding voices in the crowd have a storied history of imploding a year after you&#39;ll first discover them. <em>Be careful who you trust</em>.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-09 15:48:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lr60i0j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fzjust","parent_id":"t3_1fzjust","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"Again for the people in the back...\n\n> Generally speaking, your favorite crypto influencer is using you as exit liquidity","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Again for the people in the back...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Generally speaking, your favorite crypto influencer is using you as exit liquidity</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-09 20:09:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lr74xcx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fzjust","parent_id":"t1_lr60i0j","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Do let me know if there are any other sections on this topic you think I should include.

Market doesn&#39;t care.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, market capitalizations also do not matter. I would bet that the logo of a coin has a bigger effect limiting its price than its marketcap.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Satoshi himself could sign a tweet saying &quot;I&#39;m going to market sell 1 million bitcoin on Binance this Friday&quot; and I would not be surprised to see the price go up.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-09 15:29:52","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-10-09 15:39:59","id":"lr5xi4d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fzjust","parent_id":"t1_lr5r7vg","score":25,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/2peg2city","body":"100!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>100!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-09 21:05:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lr7c7bn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fzjust","parent_id":"t3_1fzjust","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/jaskidd05","body":"That\u2019s what I call a red cucumber\u2026 I guess upriver is Defo cancelled \ud83d\ude22","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That\u2019s what I call a red cucumber\u2026 I guess upriver is Defo cancelled \ud83d\ude22</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-09 13:58:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lr5hf7z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fzjust","parent_id":"t3_1fzjust","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Bruh can we just dump to 1600 and get this over with I\u2019m so fucking sick of -10% every few days with minimal bounces","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Bruh can we just dump to 1600 and get this over with I\u2019m so fucking sick of -10% every few days with minimal bounces</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-09 15:41:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lr5zdq2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fzjust","parent_id":"t3_1fzjust","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-09 10:32:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lr4etx9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1fzjust","parent_id":"t3_1fzjust","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/robmacca","body":"> Uh oh!
