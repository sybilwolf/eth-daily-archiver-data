What I came across, and unfortunately found myself agreeing with, is that l2s likely wont utilise eth blobs to such a degree that they contribute to gas usage / fee burns, at least not over particularly long periods. \n\nMeaning they wont contribute to ETH price appreciation. \n\nInstead they'll use eth blobs for as long as its virtually \"free\" (like right now), but as the blobs get crowded and they need to pass on the costs to their users (meaning: Higher transaction costs on their networks) they'll pivot to altDAs (like eigen) which again brings down the costs to virtually free. \n\nUnder the current set up the only reason why an l2 wouldnt pivot to the cheaper alternative is because of ideology or something equally fuzzy (Base, the l2, has publically commited to continue to use eth blobs but ultimately its run by a company, coinbase. That promise cant be relied on) \n\nFuture in progress scaling projects, like MegaETH (which frankly seems like the only current project that intends and show potential of actually competing with the throughput of Solana, and the like) have already made it clear theyre gonna utilise EigenDA or other altDAs. So the price incentives have already realised to some extent. \n\nWith the above, and the effect it as on price appreciation, I'm finding myself thinking I might be overexposed to ETH/Ethereum (this is the first time I've thought this since I first \"got into it\")\n\nThe only two \"outs\" as I see it and understand it is first off \"based\" rollups. Based rollups differ from optimistics and others in that they fully \"integrate\" with the ethereum l1 blocks, and additionally provide crosschain/layer composibility \"out of the box\". \n\nThe downside of it is that it inherits the costs of the L1, meaning several seconds long and literally *the cost* of transacting. So on the UX and application side based rollups struggle to compete with optimistic rollups and alt L1s like Solana.\n\nThey would still have the upper hand on applications for which security and credible neutrality is essential, but so far there isnt very much of those usecases yet (though the fact that essentially every enterprise/institutional endevour seem to target ethereum its at least growing, take the recent VISA news for instance)\n\nAlso, far as I know, there isnt any based rollups in operation yet. \n\nThe other \"out\" would be for the ethereum L1 to start to target and intend to its own scalability again, which would optimistically mean increased user adoption and therefore value appreciation. \n\nSo on the incentive and \"hard valuation\" side of things, I think on a balance I maybe should consider downsizing my eth portion (and such a timely point for me to do so...), and maybe even start thinking about starting some hedge positions in alt L1s like, primarily Solana, but also Avax, and possibly also OP to maybe catch some of the potential value appreciation of the rollups if, as reasoned above, the value doesnt trickle down to the \"bottom\" ethereum itself. \n\nIf I look beyond stricly incentives and \"hard valuation\" theres obviously price speculation (essentially \"sure ethereum isnt properly structured right now to draw in value, but the devs have succeeded against challenges in the past, I'm willing to financially bet they will succeed again\"), and theres betting that ethereum will get a post-BTC-peak bump like that last two times around. \n\nAnd both of those are well and good, but its not reasons enough for me to feel comfortable holding longterm in something. At best it would be about holding on through this cycle and then re-evaluate things. \n\n(btw the fact that I'm hedging on \"just need to hold out untill the cycle peaks again\" frightens me more than a little. Thats the sort of thing that makes me want to reconsider if I'm too comfortable in my assumptions of the near and medium time frame price action we can expect and if I'm therefore out of my depth)\n\nRegarding Solana. I dont like Solana. At all. I dont think its decentralised enough (or transparent enough, with its dev/marketers missleading use of data and wash trading to pump up transactions and volume) for me to want to ideologically support it and buy into it, and I also think its lack of decentralisation will eventually lead to a very large legal fall out (unless it whimpers away like Cardano first). \n\nBut what is indisputable is that Solana is, right now, outperforming ethereum when it comes to getting more users (meaning: More adoption) and allowing for cheaper and easier transactions. Even including the ethereum l2 ecosystem, if it wasnt for the recent Base performance (and god bless Base, they've excelled) Solana would have done better in these regards than all of the ethereum ecosystem. But even then, the fact remains as above that users and usage provided by l2s (non-based rollups anyway) dont provide value appreciation to ethereum because the l2s dont/wont crowd the blobs enough to driev up gas and ETH demand. \n\nAnd therefore returning to the \"hard valuation\" / incentives point of above, for price appreciation that is what matters, I cant escape the apparent reality that I might do well by flipping over some ETH to Solana, potentially both in the long and short term. \n\nIn a large regard it comes down to, at least to me, how much of price is dictated by \"hard\" data, like to drop over to bitcoin for a second, is its price over time dictated mainly by diminishing supply (because of the halvings) meeting the constant or growing demand, or is it dictated mainly by something more \"ethereal\" like metcalfes law leading to price appreciating not because of token availability but simply by the network being more used and adopted (similar to gold in that regard, funnily enough).\n\nIf you're a \"hard data/valuation/incentives\" kinda person then the fact that l2s dont use blobs enough, and potentially never will, would mean that you're bearish on ETH. The l2s are simply too extractive of users and usage from the ethereum foundation layer while not giving enough back in fees in order for value to appreciate. \n\nIf you're a more \"pure\" metcalfe effect kind of person, then value can still appreciate for ETH simply through the growing use of EVM networks and the \"soft interactivity\" between l2 chains and ethereum, and the fairly lack luster settling of data on the L1 and the inheritance of trust from the L1. \n\nEnterprises and institutions being enterprises and institutions they could throw all of this up in the air, if for instance blackrock announces and actual honest of god stock exchange implemented straight on the ethereum l1 for instance. Simply put because while raw usage and wider adoption is golden, the undeniable massive weight and volume and accumulated value from even a part of the traditional finance system of america settling on ethereum would be incomprehensibly bullish. \n\nSo, the capricious nature of american finance institutions aside, I'm struggling in aligning myself with the metcalfe assumptions. And leaning more to the hard incentives I'm finding it tough to justify my current allignment of anything-but-eth. And I think staying intellectually honest would require me to drop some eth and move to alternatives. \n\nTo be clear here, as a blockchain itself ETH *is better*. Decentralisation and credible neutrality is second to none (other than arguably BTC). But with its current rollup model I dont see how future adoption will drive up price of ETH. \n\nI will like ethereum regardless, but I'm invested because of the financial upside, not because of prestige and I-told-ya-sos in a EVM-centric future world order. \n\nThats my thoughts, apologize if too ranty. Maybe this is just the indication that bottom is in and I've reached peak personal FUD, please feel free talk me down from the ledge if you think you have anything good to counter with. \n\nEdit: I didnt mention that other than finance rails moving to etherum/blockchain my main current bull case for crypto is stablecoin adoption which is growing rapidly, but even then while ethereum currently holds the lion share in value on its chain the vast majority of users and usage can be found on either alternative l1s like Tron, Solana, etc, or on rollups. Even the relatively positive news is that one of the current wunderkinds in the space, Celo, is becoming an ethereum l2, but even then as discussed above the adoption wont provide value appreciation for Ethereum itself.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Alright so having spent the most of today going on a deep ethereum/crypto FUD dive I guess ill share my sentiment a bit in here now. </p>\n\n<p>For transparency I&#39;m allocated roughly 90/10 ETH/BTC (with some of that eth being in LSTs) </p>\n\n<p>Much of this hinges on my understanding of what the blobs do to etherums L1 gas usage.

That promise cant be relied on) </p>\n\n<p>Future in progress scaling projects, like MegaETH (which frankly seems like the only current project that intends and show potential of actually competing with the throughput of Solana, and the like) have already made it clear theyre gonna utilise EigenDA or other altDAs.
