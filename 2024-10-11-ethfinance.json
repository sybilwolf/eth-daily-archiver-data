This isn't actually the lion I minted, which I actually sold within first couple of days of the mint (I thought I could rebuy for cheaper lol). I always had the intention of holding at least one though, so when I saw the price rally, I ended up FOMO'ing into another, which I later sold after acquiring the matrix.\n\n\n**How did you get into EVMavericks?**\n\nI got into EVMavericks because I was an active member of r/ethfinance. I spent a lot of time there between like 2019-2021, and learned a lot from really smart people. I wasn't really into the whole NFT scene at the time, so when Ethraider announced the mint, I was definitely excited to get into it. Fun fact, I was the second ever minter of EVM right after Etheraider minted the very first one.\n\n**When and how did you get into crypto?**\n\nI originally got into crypto in like late 2016 when Eth was really starting to rally. Started off by trading bunch of shitcoins on Bittrex. I was really into Vertcoin at the time, which was supposed to be like Bitcoin but with ASIC resistance which served to decentralize the mining. Then the market crashed, so I lost interest but started buying btc/eth/ltc again in early 2019 when the market still seemed dead, just good ol' buy and hold. I unfortunately missed defi summer though, because I was mainly trading everything on cexes back then.\n\n**Even though you lost interest when the market crashed and the hype was gone, what made you stick around in crypto? And when it comes to EVMs, what made you stay with the community too after flipping attempts?**\n\nIt just felt more exciting than tradfi. I actually bought crypto well before I ever bought any stocks. As for EVMs, my intention was always to stay as I really like the people I had gotten to know within r/ethfinance. And I met even more people within the community, and it quickly became a tightknit group.\n\n**What are some of your most memorable experiences or highlights when it comes to EVMavericks?**\n\nI would probably have to say Goblintown. An EVM member pinged the discord late at night to alert about an interesting NFT mint happening. I managed to mint from 3 wallets, then bought two more for like 1-2e. Then I watched it run to 10e floor, and roundtripped them all as I usually do lol. But because of that ping, so many of us from EVMavs managed to mint them, and we had a cult-like following of the project for a few weeks/months.\n\n**How do you spend most of your time in the crypto space these days, and what keeps you motivated this time to stay engaged, especially during market downturns?**\n\nInitially when I got into crypto, like many others I was drawn by decentralization values and I was also really interested in learning about infrastructures and their underlying tech. Nowadays I'm more app focused, and generally chain agnostic. Over the years I've made great friends in the industry across many DAOs and communities, so I generally share and scan for alpha across these communities, and trade anything from memecoins to defi tokens. But since late 2023, I'd say >50% of my focus has been around Hyperliquid.\n\n**Speaking of alpha, anything that you can share with us? maybe some hyperliquid alpha?**\n\nHaha I mean Hyperliquid points program is done, so I think the best course of action is to just buy points OTC on markets like Bubbly or Hypurr Pump. Many people are expecting season 3 before the TGE, but I strongly believe that TGE will precede any potential future incentives (to be clear, I'm not ruling out future incentives for L1 usage after EVM compatibility is live). Currently you can buy points for like $6-$8, which is somewhere around like 15-20% token distribution for points holders at $2b FDV (or 30-40% at $1b FDV). I think the actual allocation will be much higher at around 50%, and I'm confident that FDV will run hard. Fun fact, during August to September Hyperliquid revenue exceeded that of Solana, and it also has higher YTD revenue than Uniswap. Liquid funds will definitely jump in as well unless the valuation goes crazy from the start. I've just never seen any airdrop with so many sidelined buyers (disclosure: I do have decent chunk of points so my views are likely biased). Anyway sorry, you got me all excited with Hyperliquid question, onto the next topic!\n\n**Now, what about GreenGeorge IRL? what are your hobbies or how do you spend time outside of crypto?**\n\nHmm real life GreenGeorge is a bit boring lol. I work a regular 9-5 job as an engineer. I like to cook as well as trying out new restaurants with my SO. I enjoy taking a walk especially during summer, and started getting back into swimming recently. But I also spend unhealthy amount of time staring at screens (both in and outside of work), which I guess is the lifestyle of a degen.\n\n**Lastly, is there anything else you wanna share with us, GreenGeorge? The stage is yours!**\n\nI don't want to sound overly sentimental, but I am genuinely grateful for the friends I've made in web3 over the past few years. In this mostly pseudonymous space, the reputation and trust you build are what truly matter. I'm fortunate to have surrounded myself with friends I can rely on (you know who you are). For those new to crypto, finding the right group should be a top priority, though it can be challenging. Narratives shift quickly, and it\u2019s hard to keep up on your own. I also find it helpful to bounce ideas around when in doubt.\n\nAnyway thank you for taking the time to conduct this interview. I've really enjoyed following what you're doing with the series, and I believe you're a great example of what makes EVMavericks special!\n\n----\n\n[Subscribe to our paragraph to get these interviews & more sooner](https://paragraph.xyz/@evmavericks)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F05a6ed591c44d8a26546cd35b3fd7e08.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75\"><strong>Get to know EVMavericks #7</strong></a> - GreenGeorge aka EVM 431</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hi, what do you go by and what is your EVMavericks #?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hey so my <a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F0e745d26a575413bb1ce2b3e5b149d8a.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75\">EVMavs is #431, a matrix lion</a>.
