Continuing to put our head in the sand and lose an entire adoption cycle of mindshare, capital and developers to solana because we\u2019re too stuck up, stubborn and entitled to adapt. The vc coins and defi projects that eth maxis have absolutely no problem with promoting or owning literally are worse scams than memecoins for retail. Not a single eth tech alt, L2 gov token, defi coin or restaking ponzi coin from this cycle is above its tge price. Plenty of memecoins are. ETHBTC is 50% off the highs and ethereum mindshare and market share amongst users and developers is in freefall, continuing to plummet with no bottom in sight. The community needs a wake up call and some fucking pragmatism and competent wartime leadership in winning retail and developers back to ethereum.\u00a0</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-12 09:12:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lrl1552","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1g1suyn","parent_id":"t1_lrkytiw","score":0,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SeaMonkey82","body":"> ethereum mindshare and market share amongst users and developers is in freefall, continuing to plummet with no bottom in sight\n\nDo you have some numbers to back up this claim?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>ethereum mindshare and market share amongst users and developers is in freefall, continuing to plummet with no bottom in sight</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Do you have some numbers to back up this claim?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-12 09:42:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lrl6bz5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1g1suyn","parent_id":"t1_lrl1552","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/epineph","body":"It\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019ve been around as long as you say if you think this is what the core community wants.
