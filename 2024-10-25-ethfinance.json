That base fee sets how much a unit of gas costs (for normal transactions, which use blockspace, and disregarding tips) or how much a blob costs. \n\nThere's also a target amount of resource usage: for normal transactions, that's the target gas (15M units of gas), which is half of the max gas per block (30M), and for blobs it's currently 3 blobs (out of a maximum of 6).\n\nEach block, the *actual* resource usage (gas or blobs) ends up being some number 0 <= amount <= max, which will be either greater than, equal to, or less than, the target for that resource. \n\nHere's the important part: if the resource usage is *greater than* the target (e.g. 20M gas used, which is greater than the 15M target, or 5 blobs instead of the target 3), *the next block the basefee/blob fee for that resource will be higher by a certain percentage*. The opposite also applies; if the resource usage is *less than* the target, the basefee/blob fee will decrease by a certain percentage. \n\nIt's actually kind of genius; this means that Ethereum's fees automatically adjust to demand. \n\nIf there's **high demand**, aka more users willing to pay higher gas fees for normal transactions, or more L2s willing to pay higher blob fees for blob-carrying transactions, then you would expect to see usage exceed the targets, and the next block will have higher fees, until the fees become too much and the demand (at that fee level) comes back to the target. \n\nIf there's **low demand**, in theory the opposite occurs: it indicates the resource is currently overpriced relative to supply and demand, and so the next block will have a cheaper basefee/blob fee, hopefully encouraging more usage in order to meet the target. This has worked out well for gas fees, because Ethereum has *plenty* of pent-up demand for transactions that are willing to wait for cheap gas; there's never a lack of transactions ready to be submitted when basefees lower. \n\nHowever, I said \"in theory\" because blob fees are in a different situation currently. The mechanism works the same as with the basefee, but L2s are currently not creating enough demand for blobspace the large majority of the time. This means that even when blobfees are extremely cheap (the minimum it can go to, 1 wei per blob), there's simply not enough blobs being submitted for the average block to meet its blob target (3 blobs), and if you'll recall, this means that the blob fee would continue to go down in the next block, except that it's pinned at the minimum. \n\nSo observe this highly binary situation: either there *is* enough demand for a resource, at all times, that Ethereum can always make sure it's on average meeting its target usage for that resource, or there *is not*. Block gas currently has enough demand; blobs currently do not. And observe what this means for fees: if there *is* enough demand for the resource, the fee will stay floating at some fair market rate, much greater than 0, and Ethereum can collect (and burn) those fees. But if there *is not* enough demand, the fee will bottom out at ~0 and stay there, except during occasional spikes in demand. That's where we're at with blobs right now.\n\nAnd crucially, observe **that this is a switch that can and will flip itself at some point in the future**, when blob demand from L2s and other users increases past a critical threshold, namely 3 blobs per 12 seconds. Once the average demand exceeds that, Ethereum will instantly enter a regime where blob pricing needs to follow market rates, rather than being pinned at 0.\n\nAnd as we all know, L2s are very insensitive to blob pricing. During recent blob fee spikes, we saw certain L2s paying *absurd* prices for their blobs, think multiple Ether for each blob. This is likely due to them not putting appropriate limits/waits in place, but it illustrates the point: L2s, with their high 'compression ratios' of L2 transactions to L1 commit transactions, are able to pay *much* higher fees than ordinary transactions on L1 are. \n\nSo putting it all together: blob fees will be 0, until suddenly they are *very much not 0* when demand for blobs passes a certain threshhold.\n\nAnd L2 growth over the past year has been fairly exponential. We *will* pass that threshold in the near future (potentially delayed somewhat if we raise the blob target in Pectra, albeit.)\n\nAll the handwringing about how Ethereum is not capturing value from its L2s will seem like a very silly concern not too long from now, in other words.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Just a quick recap on how fee markets work in Ethereum (both for blockspace and for blobspace):</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a base fee, which represents the current &quot;state&quot; of the fee market.

On the other hand, if we scale too slowly, demand far exceeds supply, and costs become unaffordable for many, which is also a tough narrative to deal with. We actually went from the latter state to the former nearly instantaneously, with Dencun earlier this year; it's actually somewhat miraculous when you think about it, that the popular fud went from \"no one uses it, it's too expensive\" to \"no one uses it, it's too cheap and hence worthless\" so quickly!\n\nSo what's the right approach? I feel like we're definitely erring in the right direction currently; scaling \"too much\" just means we're subsidizing cheap transactions on L2s, which have in fact been growing incredibly rapidly, both horizontally (more L2s) and vertically (more transactions on each L2) since Dencun. We might want to keep doing that for a while, but the cost that we're seeing there is that it stops Ethereum from getting good value capture, as long as we're doing it.\n\nOn the other hand, if we artificially keep blobspace a little more limited than the network would actually support, by not increasing the blob target even if we could, then we will see that value capture engage, but at the cost of L2s becoming more expensive suddenly, which of course puts an end to the availability of vast quantities of cheap L2 transactions, and the exponential growth those have been enabling. It's a fine line we get to walk; I almost wonder if we'll figure out some programmatic way of doing it, rather than having every single upgrade from here on out feature a controversial decision about how much to increase blobspace.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s an excellent question, and one the community (including core devs) have been struggling with these past months.

We actually went from the latter state to the former nearly instantaneously, with Dencun earlier this year; it&#39;s actually somewhat miraculous when you think about it, that the popular fud went from &quot;no one uses it, it&#39;s too expensive&quot; to &quot;no one uses it, it&#39;s too cheap and hence worthless&quot; so quickly!</p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s the right approach? I feel like we&#39;re definitely erring in the right direction currently; scaling &quot;too much&quot; just means we&#39;re subsidizing cheap transactions on L2s, which have in fact been growing incredibly rapidly, both horizontally (more L2s) and vertically (more transactions on each L2) since Dencun. We might want to keep doing that for a while, but the cost that we&#39;re seeing there is that it stops Ethereum from getting good value capture, as long as we&#39;re doing it.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if we artificially keep blobspace a little more limited than the network would actually support, by not increasing the blob target even if we could, then we will see that value capture engage, but at the cost of L2s becoming more expensive suddenly, which of course puts an end to the availability of vast quantities of cheap L2 transactions, and the exponential growth those have been enabling. It&#39;s a fine line we get to walk; I almost wonder if we&#39;ll figure out some programmatic way of doing it, rather than having every single upgrade from here on out feature a controversial decision about how much to increase blobspace.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-25 09:53:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ltpl65c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gbml3v","parent_id":"t1_ltpi47j","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/aaj094","body":"What determines how often an L2 has to post blobs?

It needs to be secure, so it has limits to how fast it can go. For example, Ethereum has a massive consensus overhead. Actual transactions versus consensus messages is around a factor of 200-300. That is the price for being secure. This overhead will be reduced after the next chain upgrade. Solana has a much lower consensus overhead (x3-10) and is less secure. MegaETH can get rid of this overhead.\n\n2. Single sequencer. No consensus needs to be found between sequencers which slows things down massively. This again is only possible as a rollup/optimium/validium. \n\n3. My 2 year old Intel NUC can validate over 1 Ggas/s using Nethermind. Sure it is not exactly the same as what the MegaETH sequencer will have to do. But, they will have a much more powerful server.

Currently they plan to use optimistic fraud proofs, which makes it necessary to run provers to make sure the sequencer does not include invalid transactions. As long as at least one of these provers is honest your funds are safe.  They plan to use zk proofs later on which then means you can get rid of the provers. The chain is then secured by cryptography and not by 1 of n trust assumptions.\n\n6. They can make it much more secure by using escape hatches and forced transaction inclusion through Ethereum mainnet. This would prevent you getting stuck because the sequencer goes down, you can also not be censored.

As long as at least one of these provers is honest your funds are safe.  They plan to use zk proofs later on which then means you can get rid of the provers. The chain is then secured by cryptography and not by 1 of n trust assumptions.</p></li>\n<li><p>They can make it much more secure by using escape hatches and forced transaction inclusion through Ethereum mainnet. This would prevent you getting stuck because the sequencer goes down, you can also not be censored. I guess this will not be their main goal at the beginning though. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All in all I do not think MegaETHs claims are too outlandish. They are optimistic for sure.
