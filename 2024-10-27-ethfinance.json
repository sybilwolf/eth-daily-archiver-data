To conclude let's focus on what should you do to get started? What's in your metaphorical backpack so you can be prepared like a good little boy scout? Where should you go exploring first?\n\n**Curate Your Feed**\n\nGenerally speaking my feed consists of three things:\n\n1) Project introductions. This is mostly YouTube for me. My list changes over time but has included Bankless, Bell Curve, and some much smaller accounts like Jordan McKinney. This type of content is often very biased so don't expect too much from it besides background context on the project, what they are doing and how it's novel, and the bull case. They usually aren't going to compare themselves to their peers here or tell you how the project might fail. This will give you a list of things to research more deeply.\n\n2) Official announcements. I check my Discord/Telegram announcement feed every morning, build up a list of tabs, and clear it by the end of the day. Sometimes I'll hear about new projects from partnership announcements.\n\n3) Discussion. This is where people get into the most trouble. Don't let a social media tech giant direct your learning. Price of a project being shilled (especially on short horizons) is a terrible metric for the quality of a source. You might think to follow technology leaders but without enough background you're as likely to start following Charles Hoskinson or Richard Heart as Vitalik Buterin. They all sound convincing to the uninitiated. What I recommend is rather than look for technical or wealthy people to instead look for project experts other than the team members that post about an application or ecosystem you already understand. You need to be able make sense of what is being said and make an informed decision about whether they are saying it in an intellectually honest way. Personally, I'll also actively talk with community managers and members of projects but I'm looking for much deeper information or collaboration opportunities. You're never going to find a Microsoft dev to ask question to but you very well might find and ask questions directly to a project founder in web3.\n\nThe more you fill your feed with people who are only interested in price the less happy you'll be. The more impatient you are to get rich quick, the more money will slip through your fingers and the more you're going to be spending on therapy and blood pressure meds. Instead fill your feed with information worth knowing and spreading.\n\n**Hands On Learning**\n\nUndoubtedly the best way to explore the Rabbit Hole is to go there yourself. As I hopefully gotten across by now, focus on survival. Learn with small amounts to limit the liability of beginners mistakes. Start with stablecoins where you can to avoid price volatility risks. Start with older projects and projects with higher TVL because they tend to be safer. Start with simpler applications. In an attempt to be helpful getting you started here is a bunch of things to search out yourself sorted into categories by relevance to you and then roughly by approachability and importance. There's a lot of editorial discretion here and you can be sure this is incomplete and will be out of date.\n\n*Defi*\n\n1) Money markets such as Aave and Compound\n\n2) Dexs such as Uniswap and Curve\n\n3) Liquidity incentives/farming such as bribes, bonds, marketing, points\n\n4) Leverage such as Gearbox, Defisaver, or GMX\n\n5) Options such as Lyra, Hegic\n\n6) Real world asset protocols such as Centrifuge and Maker\n\n7) Regen finance such as Gitcoin Grants, Greenpill, and Klima\n\n*Digital Identity*\n\n1) Ethereum Name Service (ENS), basically a human readable address\n\n2) Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS).

You should bookmark these when you find them and swing by every once in awhile as you level up until one day it clicks. Occasionally you'll even find useful summaries like [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1eer8s9/daily_general_discussion_july_29_2024/lfigqox/) that infodump many of these in one place. Eventually you'll know what jargon like reentrancy guards are. You learn a lot about how things work by how things break.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOver time if you follow the advice here you'll know more than 99% of Crypto Twitter on a good variety of topics, you'll be able to take measured and deliberate risks, and you'll fall into communities that share your values. You'll probably meet some of these people in person at conferences. You may end up getting a job here. You may end up not needing a job at all. You'll definitely find sources of joy and points of light in an otherwise dark world. Whatever happens, you will be changed in ways you aren't expecting.
