This started when I first attended ETHDenver, and I generally just attended talks all day every day, took notes, and summarized my favorites. Now that I'm [more involved](https://aestus.live) on a day-to-day basis, my conference activities have become a bit more varied and I find that if you're already in the loop, conference talks tend to just repeat info that's available in more detail elsewhere.\n\nBut I still like to report on the talks that I find interesting, and can always find topics I'm less familiar with if I just step away from the MEV talks for a minute. Regardless of technical content, I also like to convey a little bit of what these events feel like to attend, for anyone who may be interested in the future. And finally, I hope to encourage ethfinanciers to be the change they want to see in the sub: the sorts of summaries I write are the sort of content I also enjoy consuming here, and I'd always like to see more of it.\n\nSo today I thought I'd hit on the broader Ethereum event structure. You see, I just arrived in Thailand and will be here for *nearly a month* doing Ethereum stuff. If you really want to you can structure your whole life around bouncing from tangentially-Ethereum-related event to tangentially-Ethereum-related event. Some people do just that, and would be better qualified to explain that lifestyle, but I think I'm getting a taste of it here. So I'll give a bit of an overview of what I'm looking at in Thailand.\n\n-------\n\nTo start off, I am in Chiang Mai for the last two weeks of [Edge City](https://www.edgecity.live/about) [Lanna](https://www.edgecity.live/lanna). There are a lot of different potential lenses through which to look at Edge City, but in general it is a month-long *popup village* where attendees all live in the same neighborhood in Chiang Mai, with a number of buildings rented out to serve as communal coworking, dining, social, wellness, and learning spaces. It creates a bit of a university campus feeling. There's lots of room for flexibly structuring your day with some combination of your own work and shared workshops/classes, with infrastructure in place to help you eat well, socialize, and keep your body and mind healthy. That description leaves a lot in the air for what people actually *do* there, but it's generally web3/Ethereum (+longevity/AI/network-state/health/etc) focused: we have tracks on stablecoins and governance this week, and next week I'll be diving into Sequencing Week to focus on based sequencing and preconfirmations.\n\nThen I fly down to Bangkok. Shortly before Devcon I am attending the [Staking Summit](https://lu.ma/stakingsummit24). I went to their event last year in Istanbul and thought it was interesting enough to attend again. The core audience is really institutional staking-as-a-service providers, and a lot of people there see staking as just like a financial product that gives yield, and don't really care about the underlying protocols. But they offered a steep discount to home stakers so I expect to see some friendly faces there, and I can always chat with validators about their thoughts on timing games, MEV, commitments/preconfs, and so on. If it turns out to be boring, well, I could probably use a few days off.\n\nThen comes [Devcon](https://devcon.org/en/) proper. I guess there's still no concrete schedule, but there are four main days on the calendar. A number of side events too, which for the most part come in the days before Devcon or in the evenings after Devcon days. I'm signed up for far too many sequencing events and expect to be thoroughly bored of the subject by the end. For Devcon I intend to be in full conference mode, attending talks and writing up my usual summaries.\n\nFinally comes Hodlercon in Phuket. This is the one place on the internet where Hodlercon needs no particular explanation. I expect to treat Hodlercon kind of like Edge City, aiming for a mix of learning, socializing, and leading for a healthy lifestyle. But of course it's going to be more personal, even less structured, and more vacation-y. The planner that the team has been working with has... not been particularly impressive so far. But as long as we get our hotel rooms confirmed and we can all make it to Phuket together, we can always work out the rest.\n\n-------\n\nThat's a lot of time in Thailand! And plenty to do. I think I'm going to be very glad to get back to a cool climate after a long, tropical month.\n\nSo I'll give my thoughts on Edge City once it's done, and will report on Staking Summit if it's interesting enough to warrant the posts. Devcon gets daily updates for sure, Hodlercon maybe gets one summary at the end. In the meantime, Edge City provides plenty of opportunity for focused work time, and I think it may be time to write up a primer on based sequencing and preconfs intended for the solo+home staker audience. I think there are even writing clinics here where I can get some feedback first. Anyone else visiting can feel free to reach out whenever!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Devcon &amp; Friends Intro and Plans</strong></p>\n\n<p>Something I like to do when the time arises is to report on Ethereum conference happenings, e.g. <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1e0gtdv/daily_general_discussion_july_11_2024/lcqtfu9/\">my EthCC summaries</a>.
