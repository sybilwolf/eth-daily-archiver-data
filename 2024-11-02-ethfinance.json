Time flies. I thought this would be a good opportunity to provide an update given that there's a very clear dividing line in my schedule: I had lots of flexibility to do various Edge City things this last week, but next week will be much more structured and technical. So it's a good time to summarize the experience so far. Whopper of a post today.\n\nFirst, the *broad strokes*.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Edge City is a popup village, a descendant of sorts from Zuzalu, where a bunch of people have come to live and work in a small neighborhood in Chiang Mai for up to a month. The central themes, as listed on their website, are human organization, AI, real-world crypto, health/longevity, and hard tech. It's easy to paint over it with broad strokes to say \"it's kind of Ethereum-adjacent tech and culture stuff\", but I have been quite impressed with the extent to which it is really interdisciplinary.\n\nProbably half of the people I've met have their focus outside of blockchain/web3 (often they're exploring if we can provide tools to help with their own endeavors), and it's really cool to have gathered all these different people in one place. Meeting new people and hearing the breadth of their backgrounds has been one of my favorite parts of my time here. I have also seen a number of familiar faces (some from here as well--hi!), and expect more to make it for the last week before Devcon.\n\n[Cursive](https://www.cursive.team/) put together NFC wristbands for everyone to make it easy to share contact info, build a connection graph, and use ZK proofs to find common interests and discussion topics without just revealing each person's whole list to each other. RadicalxChange has a local currency, [Edges](https://lannaedges.radicalxchange.org/), intended to be used to pay for personal services or perishable goods specifically within Edge City. These get... a little use. Telegram, the Thai Baht, and good old fashioned \"what do you do?\" still remain the ultimate coordination tools.\n\n------\n\n*Programming*\n\nThere are only a few events that are truly Edge City first-party official. Daily communal breakfasts and lunches, big Sunday dinners, weekly project demo days, and a few others. Each week there are a number of major featured events and a few central multi-day tracks, organized somewhat independently but with a degree of Edge City sponsorship/promotion.\n\nThis last week we had talks and workshops on stablecoins and governance games. There's an ongoing multi-day \"existential hope worldbuilding\" series, and today there's a full-day AI x Neuro event. But generally anyone has the freedom to schedule an event, book a room in one of the shared buildings, and be just as \"official\" as anyone else.\n\nAs such there is a *lot* of flexibility in how you structure your day. I like to sign up for anything that sounds interesting, which means I spend most of each day in The-A-Ter, our lecture hall of sorts, and otherwise bouncing around to wherever fun and weird stuff is going on. Other people have made heavy use of the coworking space to get some building done. Others can dive into the wellness angle and focus on taking care of themselves for a while, or use Edge City as a home base to explore Chiang Mai and find others to get out with.\n\n--------\n\n*My Experience*\n\nI started off with what I thought was a pretty balanced schedule. I'd eat breakfast at the hotel, do a bit of yoga or something, spend an hour or two in the coworking space, then attend talks and workshops most of the rest of the day with a communal lunch break at some point. Maybe a cold plunge and sauna in the late afternoon, followed by dinner and a quiet evening back at the hotel. There is a whole world of more lively evening events (raves out in the woods?) that I tend to skip--not really my thing.\n\nI caught a fairly minor cold that messed with my morning routine for a few days (sleeping in more, skipping the workout), but feeling better now and need to re-establish some structure there. Currently recovering from an ankle injury that I should avoid putting high impact on, so without my go-to sport of running I have to be a little more creative, but there are plenty of options here.\n\nHere's a sampler of the sort of events I've been going to:\n\n* Weekly community demo days intended to showcase work that's being done here now. Mostly your usual suite of Ethereumy projects, with perhaps a focus on Edge City themes. [ZK Email](https://prove.email/) had some neat updates since I'd last checked in, one example being a side-event at Devcon that you can only get into if you provide a zk proof that you received a rejection email for a Devcon speaker application.\n* Did a few days of yoga, never even tried it before. I still don't necessarily get the full picture, but it seems like a good combination of strength and flexibility exercises, with an element of just aiming for loosening up and feeling good. Less regimented than my usual workouts but I guess that's the point.\n* Someone was working on a video game, wanted playtesters, and cared enough to create a scheduled time to try it out. So sure, why not.\n* Attended an evening talk on consciousness and the speaker's idea of [vasocomputation](https://opentheory.net/2023/07/principles-of-vasocomputation-a-unification-of-buddhist-phenomenology-active-inference-and-physical-reflex-part-i/).

Time flies. I thought this would be a good opportunity to provide an update given that there&#39;s a very clear dividing line in my schedule: I had lots of flexibility to do various Edge City things this last week, but next week will be much more structured and technical. So it&#39;s a good time to summarize the experience so far. Whopper of a post today.</p>\n\n<p>First, the <em>broad strokes</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned before, Edge City is a popup village, a descendant of sorts from Zuzalu, where a bunch of people have come to live and work in a small neighborhood in Chiang Mai for up to a month. The central themes, as listed on their website, are human organization, AI, real-world crypto, health/longevity, and hard tech. It&#39;s easy to paint over it with broad strokes to say &quot;it&#39;s kind of Ethereum-adjacent tech and culture stuff&quot;, but I have been quite impressed with the extent to which it is really interdisciplinary.</p>\n\n<p>Probably half of the people I&#39;ve met have their focus outside of blockchain/web3 (often they&#39;re exploring if we can provide tools to help with their own endeavors), and it&#39;s really cool to have gathered all these different people in one place. Meeting new people and hearing the breadth of their backgrounds has been one of my favorite parts of my time here. I have also seen a number of familiar faces (some from here as well--hi!), and expect more to make it for the last week before Devcon.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cursive.team/\">Cursive</a> put together NFC wristbands for everyone to make it easy to share contact info, build a connection graph, and use ZK proofs to find common interests and discussion topics without just revealing each person&#39;s whole list to each other. RadicalxChange has a local currency, <a href=\"https://lannaedges.radicalxchange.org/\">Edges</a>, intended to be used to pay for personal services or perishable goods specifically within Edge City. These get... a little use. Telegram, the Thai Baht, and good old fashioned &quot;what do you do?&quot; still remain the ultimate coordination tools.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><em>Programming</em></p>\n\n<p>There are only a few events that are truly Edge City first-party official. Daily communal breakfasts and lunches, big Sunday dinners, weekly project demo days, and a few others. Each week there are a number of major featured events and a few central multi-day tracks, organized somewhat independently but with a degree of Edge City sponsorship/promotion.</p>\n\n<p>This last week we had talks and workshops on stablecoins and governance games. There&#39;s an ongoing multi-day &quot;existential hope worldbuilding&quot; series, and today there&#39;s a full-day AI x Neuro event. But generally anyone has the freedom to schedule an event, book a room in one of the shared buildings, and be just as &quot;official&quot; as anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>As such there is a <em>lot</em> of flexibility in how you structure your day. I like to sign up for anything that sounds interesting, which means I spend most of each day in The-A-Ter, our lecture hall of sorts, and otherwise bouncing around to wherever fun and weird stuff is going on. Other people have made heavy use of the coworking space to get some building done. Others can dive into the wellness angle and focus on taking care of themselves for a while, or use Edge City as a home base to explore Chiang Mai and find others to get out with.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><em>My Experience</em></p>\n\n<p>I started off with what I thought was a pretty balanced schedule. I&#39;d eat breakfast at the hotel, do a bit of yoga or something, spend an hour or two in the coworking space, then attend talks and workshops most of the rest of the day with a communal lunch break at some point. Maybe a cold plunge and sauna in the late afternoon, followed by dinner and a quiet evening back at the hotel. There is a whole world of more lively evening events (raves out in the woods?) that I tend to skip--not really my thing.</p>\n\n<p>I caught a fairly minor cold that messed with my morning routine for a few days (sleeping in more, skipping the workout), but feeling better now and need to re-establish some structure there. Currently recovering from an ankle injury that I should avoid putting high impact on, so without my go-to sport of running I have to be a little more creative, but there are plenty of options here.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a sampler of the sort of events I&#39;ve been going to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weekly community demo days intended to showcase work that&#39;s being done here now. Mostly your usual suite of Ethereumy projects, with perhaps a focus on Edge City themes. <a href=\"https://prove.email/\">ZK Email</a> had some neat updates since I&#39;d last checked in, one example being a side-event at Devcon that you can only get into if you provide a zk proof that you received a rejection email for a Devcon speaker application.</li>\n<li>Did a few days of yoga, never even tried it before. I still don&#39;t necessarily get the full picture, but it seems like a good combination of strength and flexibility exercises, with an element of just aiming for loosening up and feeling good. Less regimented than my usual workouts but I guess that&#39;s the point.</li>\n<li>Someone was working on a video game, wanted playtesters, and cared enough to create a scheduled time to try it out. So sure, why not.</li>\n<li>Attended an evening talk on consciousness and the speaker&#39;s idea of <a href=\"https://opentheory.net/2023/07/principles-of-vasocomputation-a-unification-of-buddhist-phenomenology-active-inference-and-physical-reflex-part-i/\">vasocomputation</a>. I&#39;m skeptical, but fun to get a little out there occasionally.</li>\n<li>Stablecoin track: Discussions around recoverability (would you opt-in to a system where a trusted admin could revert a transfer?), yield-bearing stables, vitalik advocating for decentralized stablecoins, a confidential ERC-20 standard, temporary approvals, etc. Breakout sessions after each day to discuss topics in groups of ~5.</li>\n<li>Learned about a method for collective evaluation of contributions to a community via pairwise comparisons. Potentially applicable to allocation of value to public goods.</li>\n<li>A short session where someone just wanted to talk with like-minded people about packing light for the digital nomad life. I got to show off my ~30L pack setup that holds everything I need for this month.</li>\n<li>An informal session to chat about different views on longevity research, trying to bridge the gap a little between the longevity focused people who think &quot;death-ists&quot; are ignorant, and the folks from outside the space who think the longevity people are out of touch.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s probably fair to ask if Edge City is worth the costs.
