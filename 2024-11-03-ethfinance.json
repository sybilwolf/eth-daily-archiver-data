I made it in a way that anyone can initiate this transaction and then let a keeper network (~~PowerAgent~~ PowerPool) claim it for me. Every Monday morning my debit card gets a refill. The mind blowing part about this was that I never had to make an account at any exchange, sign up to any services which would custody my funds or anything like that.

They were doxed, we were not, so they created a multisig with enough devcon team members in it so we could not screw them over. All of this was done within a few hours.
