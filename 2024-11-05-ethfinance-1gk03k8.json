Stuff like the  blackrock fund  BUIDL on ethereum creates almost no fees, but is still obvious valuable for a chain. So it&#39;s just another metric in a sea of metrics. It&#39;s very easy to calculate and is likely overemphasized because metrics like adoption and decentralization are very hard to measure. Yet another reason, IMO, to not focus too much on the burn/ultrasound money, it just place us in awkward spots like these with bad narratives.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-05 09:26:59","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-11-05 13:02:26","id":"lvjy251","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gk03k8","parent_id":"t1_lvjr8dd","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/aaqy","body":"Solana deactivated the 50% burn long ago and validators receive 100% of the fees.
