The hyperbole was obviously too far away from the reality of what is happening in the deposit pool and minipool creators.\n\nI agree that the discount on rETH is not something that should be celebrated. Currently it is 0.25% below peg not a lot, but still too much in my opinion. It corresponds to about 1-2 months of rETH rewards. It is now at a similar discount to what other LSTs have. Except stETH which is closer to intrinsic value. As we have seen the rocketpool deposit pool is not very good in balancing out supply and demand of node operators and rETH and it only starts to balance out once it is either full or empty and rETH has a premium or discount. I am honestly not sure if one can currently design a deposit pool which manages to balance things out without artificially adding a premium or a discount at either end of the pool fullness. \n\nYour example with rETH being burned sounds to me like that is the balancing process in the works. I was honestly rather afraid that minipools will just sit on their staked ETH and not close down as they are making profits anyway. This would be even more harmful as all the rETH holders would be royally fleeced with a heavy discount. I think it is great that finally all the drag on the rETH APY is gone deposit pool is empty and the ETH in the rETH contract is also redeemed. This made the rETH APY jump from around 2.5% (before saturn 0) to 3.16% averaged over the last week. This is amazing and it makes rETH competitive again. It now is pretty close to the APY stETH and swETH delivers whereas it was at or even below the levels that cbETH brings and that was abysmal. People might want to deposit more if they see these APY numbers again, but it will be a slow process. \n\nI generally view it as follows, the rules changed and the protocol will find a new balance point from which it can hopefully grow. We will see if the initial plan to grow TVL will work out in the coming months. What we know for sure it did not work out in the RPL mandatory regime as it hit a ceiling a long time ago.\n\n~~How the TVL develops is interesting, the few charts I have seen (defillama rocketpool TVL in ETH terms) have it jumped by a few percent over the last week. So, despite all the burning there is an overall growth. I am not sure however how they get to this number. From what I have looked at they do not include RPL, but still the absolute value of the TVL is a bit suspicious. Overall the little blip in TVL increase is not something I would personally use to bet all my wealth on, but at least it is increasing.~~ See comment below how this TVL number is absolutely wrong.\n\nThe next point you mention in another post about Saturn 1 and 2 going even more extreme in this direction and making the problem worse. Yes, agree there is something that needs to be done to improve the balancing. Not sure if protocol forced exit are something that is discussed as I am not that deep into the rocketpool development. But they could help in repegging discounts faster. It feels like the days of rocketpool being gnode operator limited are finally over and that is a good thing overall.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>And I paraphrased your hyperbole statement to make a point how it was received for me. The hyperbole was obviously too far away from the reality of what is happening in the deposit pool and minipool creators.</p>\n\n<p>I agree that the discount on rETH is not something that should be celebrated. Currently it is 0.25% below peg not a lot, but still too much in my opinion. It corresponds to about 1-2 months of rETH rewards. It is now at a similar discount to what other LSTs have. Except stETH which is closer to intrinsic value. As we have seen the rocketpool deposit pool is not very good in balancing out supply and demand of node operators and rETH and it only starts to balance out once it is either full or empty and rETH has a premium or discount. I am honestly not sure if one can currently design a deposit pool which manages to balance things out without artificially adding a premium or a discount at either end of the pool fullness. </p>\n\n<p>Your example with rETH being burned sounds to me like that is the balancing process in the works. I was honestly rather afraid that minipools will just sit on their staked ETH and not close down as they are making profits anyway. This would be even more harmful as all the rETH holders would be royally fleeced with a heavy discount. I think it is great that finally all the drag on the rETH APY is gone deposit pool is empty and the ETH in the rETH contract is also redeemed. This made the rETH APY jump from around 2.5% (before saturn 0) to 3.16% averaged over the last week. This is amazing and it makes rETH competitive again. It now is pretty close to the APY stETH and swETH delivers whereas it was at or even below the levels that cbETH brings and that was abysmal. People might want to deposit more if they see these APY numbers again, but it will be a slow process. </p>\n\n<p>I generally view it as follows, the rules changed and the protocol will find a new balance point from which it can hopefully grow. We will see if the initial plan to grow TVL will work out in the coming months. What we know for sure it did not work out in the RPL mandatory regime as it hit a ceiling a long time ago.</p>\n\n<p><del>How the TVL develops is interesting, the few charts I have seen (defillama rocketpool TVL in ETH terms) have it jumped by a few percent over the last week. So, despite all the burning there is an overall growth. I am not sure however how they get to this number. From what I have looked at they do not include RPL, but still the absolute value of the TVL is a bit suspicious. Overall the little blip in TVL increase is not something I would personally use to bet all my wealth on, but at least it is increasing.</del> See comment below how this TVL number is absolutely wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The next point you mention in another post about Saturn 1 and 2 going even more extreme in this direction and making the problem worse. Yes, agree there is something that needs to be done to improve the balancing. Not sure if protocol forced exit are something that is discussed as I am not that deep into the rocketpool development. But they could help in repegging discounts faster. It feels like the days of rocketpool being gnode operator limited are finally over and that is a good thing overall.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-07 01:37:01","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-11-07 02:20:26","id":"lvveahe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gkrnmn","parent_id":"t1_lvv9152","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haloooloolo","body":"Pretty easy explanation for DefiLlama: it\u2019s just wrong.

We were in contact before to discuss this proposal. I think we agree on most points. He was far more active in the forum than I was and I only read it once it went to the vote.\n\nIn short, I plan to vote yes as the TPP-1 is I think good for the zksync protocol to grow and attract new users. As always if someone has strong opinions in the other direction, I am open to hear them.\n\nThe following points are things I liked and disliked about this TPP:\n\nCons:\n\n- The overhead is rather large. eg for openblocks: Paying people 430k$ (current zk price) for what they estimate around 18 months of full tine work for a single person. That is pretty steep. Another 110k$ for using their analytics platform.  Similar steep costs for the other project running company. Talented people cost money, but I still think this is on the higher end of the salary range pretty much anywhere. \n\n- Same old approach, attracting liquidity farmers, many of whom will leave after the program. Does not fit the goal of the TPPs perfectly. \n\n- Defi Steering committee (DSC) has about 1.3 million $ for discretionary use during the program. That is a massive amount to reserve for marketing, audit and unforeseen costs.\n\n-  DSC has members which are not that well known and have not been delegates until after they were included. \n\n- Basics have been set and are non negotiable: 2 companies and DSC members.\n\n- They missed to answer some of the questions. One can interpret quite a bit into this.\n\nPro\n\n- zksync TVL and usage dropped substantially in the last months and if a bull market manifests in the next year or so, zksync needs to be ready.\n\n- Defi Steering Committee (DSC) compensation sounds reasonable.\n\n- A Matter labs representative is in the DSC which gives it more credibility\n\n- Program can be cancelled after every season by the DSC.\n\n- Quite a bit of honest interaction by the proposers which makes it sound they have the right mindset.\n\nTo me it does not sound like the perfect proposal. A lot of smaller questions have been unanswered. Only being able to wave it through without being able to change anything substantial leaves a bad aftertaste. Nevertheless, I think overall this is an important program and zksync definitely needs more liquidity and usage. I am not happy with the intransparent setup of this TTIP (companies and DSC pre-selected) and the argument for being time constrained does not make too much sense as another month or 2 of delay would not be a big deal. But to it does not look like it is an obvious 'grab the treasury and run' type proposal, but it can very well be a 'lets inflate our costs' so we can get some juicy salaries while delivering this.\n\nSo, all in all it does not sound like a clear cut good or bad proposal but somewhere in between. I will vote yes, as it looks like to me the positive points outweigh the negative ones.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for Benido for initiating this discussion. We were in contact before to discuss this proposal. I think we agree on most points. He was far more active in the forum than I was and I only read it once it went to the vote.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I plan to vote yes as the TPP-1 is I think good for the zksync protocol to grow and attract new users. As always if someone has strong opinions in the other direction, I am open to hear them.</p>\n\n<p>The following points are things I liked and disliked about this TPP:</p>\n\n<p>Cons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The overhead is rather large. eg for openblocks: Paying people 430k$ (current zk price) for what they estimate around 18 months of full tine work for a single person. That is pretty steep. Another 110k$ for using their analytics platform.  Similar steep costs for the other project running company. Talented people cost money, but I still think this is on the higher end of the salary range pretty much anywhere. </p></li>\n<li><p>Same old approach, attracting liquidity farmers, many of whom will leave after the program. Does not fit the goal of the TPPs perfectly. </p></li>\n<li><p>Defi Steering committee (DSC) has about 1.3 million $ for discretionary use during the program. That is a massive amount to reserve for marketing, audit and unforeseen costs.</p></li>\n<li><p>DSC has members which are not that well known and have not been delegates until after they were included. </p></li>\n<li><p>Basics have been set and are non negotiable: 2 companies and DSC members.</p></li>\n<li><p>They missed to answer some of the questions. One can interpret quite a bit into this.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Pro</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>zksync TVL and usage dropped substantially in the last months and if a bull market manifests in the next year or so, zksync needs to be ready.</p></li>\n<li><p>Defi Steering Committee (DSC) compensation sounds reasonable.</p></li>\n<li><p>A Matter labs representative is in the DSC which gives it more credibility</p></li>\n<li><p>Program can be cancelled after every season by the DSC.</p></li>\n<li><p>Quite a bit of honest interaction by the proposers which makes it sound they have the right mindset.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To me it does not sound like the perfect proposal.
