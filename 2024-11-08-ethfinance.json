My co-worker was tweeting about it and right away I knew it was something special. My wife's family is from overseas and I understood the challenges they had both transferring money internationally and securing their assets during times of conflict.  I was buying Bitcoin through Coinbase and Circle for the next few years before learning about Ethereum.  The ability to use applications on top of the blockchain and the promise of proof of stake caused me begin investing in 2016.\n\n**How did you get into EVMavericks?**\n\nI am the proud recipient of my EVM from the raffle that happened during the launch.  I was a heavy lurker of r/ethfinance.  I do not post regularly (or at all) but love to read and learn from others.  I was not apart of an NFT community yet so I was really happy to be welcomed into the EVMavericks.\n\n**How has your stay been in crypto and EVMavericks? any fond memories that you wanna share?**\n\nI feel at home within the Ethereum community as it aligns most with my values and what I want the world to be in the future.  Through EVMavericks, I have found a place where I can be more comfortable posting my questions and thoughts and it has led to more meaningful interactions than what I could get on other platforms.  My fondest memory was being invited to stay at the RocketPool community house for ETHDenver and going skiing afterwards with @The-A-word and @austonst. I have received a ton of help from members with my validator and it makes me feel good to be able to support creator's within the community like @heeey, @TheBenMeadows, @NaeNaeBaby_ETH, @doomfuzz_eth, and others.\n\n**What content do you usually like to read and learn about? Any favorite topics or anything goes?**\n\nMy passion lies in data engineering and analytics.  I spend a lot of time on @Dune just looking through dashboards and studying others query structures and methods for calculating metrics (boring right?).  I listen to The Daily Gwei and Bankless on a daily basis to keep up with what is new in the space.  Outside of crypto, I read a lot about fantasy football and sports betting.  I am the reigning champion of the EVMavericks fantasy football league and looking to repeat.\n\n**Not boring at all! can you tell us more about dashboards and dune? What catches your interest? \nMaybe some tips for people who are curious about that too and looking get into studying the same structures, where would they start? Or anything else that you feel like sharing from that!**\n\nMy day job is data analytics so it is my way of contributing to the community.  I love the availability of blockchain data and how it can be used to verify truth from fiction.  Dune makes is so easy to get started. You can easily view others queries and they have a lot of AI tools to help you find relevant data.  SQL is such an easy programming language to learn even if you do not know any other programming.\n\n**How does it feel to be the reigning champion and how did it feel to win? was the competition tough or were you ahead of all by a long mile?**\n\nI feel like 80% of fantasy football is luck so really I just got lucky.  It takes a lot of work navigating injuries, studying matchups, and knowing which players to drop or add to your team as the season progresses.  I was leading the majority of the season, but I had a pretty bad week in the championship and was just lucky enough that my opponent had worse.\n\n**Let's switch gears, how do you usually spend time outside of crypto? what are your hobbies?**\n\nI have a ton of hobbies outside of crypto.  Most recently I have been learning to golf (the hardest sport I've ever played).  I have always loved watching sports, football and basketball.  I like to attend rock concerts, most recently Cage the Elephant and Slipknot. I also have developed an obsession for jigsaw puzzles.  Mostly, I enjoy anything that keeps my mind busy or is outside in the fresh air.\n\n**Any alpha or advice that you can give us? It can be anything.**\n\nMy best advice to people is to get out there and actually try the things you are hearing about.  Experience is the best way to learn and the only way you can have a valid opinion.  I have not been successful with everything I've done in crypto, but each thing has been a learning experience that puts me one step ahead of someone who has just heard about it.\n\n**Lastly, is there anything else you wanna share with us, titey? The stage is yours!**\n\nJust want to say that the people I've interacted with in crypto have been some of the smartest, most friendly and interesting people I have ever interacted with.  I know WAGMI and from the bottom of my heart think together we will make the world a better place.  Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit more about me.\n\n----\n\n[Subscribe to our paragraph to get these interviews & more sooner](https://paragraph.xyz/@evmavericks)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gb5F80TbwAEaIcl?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\"><strong>Get to know EVMavericks #10</strong></a> - titey aka EVM 1043</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hi, what do you go by and what is your EVMavericks #?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gb5F_9JaAAA3f5M?format=png&amp;name=large\">Yo, I am EVM #1043 and I go by titey or titus.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>When and how did you get into crypto?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I got into crypto when Bitcoin originally spiked to $1K following a US congressional hearing in November 2013.

SQL is such an easy programming language to learn even if you do not know any other programming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does it feel to be the reigning champion and how did it feel to win? was the competition tough or were you ahead of all by a long mile?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I feel like 80% of fantasy football is luck so really I just got lucky.  It takes a lot of work navigating injuries, studying matchups, and knowing which players to drop or add to your team as the season progresses.  I was leading the majority of the season, but I had a pretty bad week in the championship and was just lucky enough that my opponent had worse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let&#39;s switch gears, how do you usually spend time outside of crypto? what are your hobbies?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a ton of hobbies outside of crypto.  Most recently I have been learning to golf (the hardest sport I&#39;ve ever played).  I have always loved watching sports, football and basketball.  I like to attend rock concerts, most recently Cage the Elephant and Slipknot. I also have developed an obsession for jigsaw puzzles.  Mostly, I enjoy anything that keeps my mind busy or is outside in the fresh air.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any alpha or advice that you can give us? It can be anything.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My best advice to people is to get out there and actually try the things you are hearing about.  Experience is the best way to learn and the only way you can have a valid opinion.  I have not been successful with everything I&#39;ve done in crypto, but each thing has been a learning experience that puts me one step ahead of someone who has just heard about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lastly, is there anything else you wanna share with us, titey? The stage is yours!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just want to say that the people I&#39;ve interacted with in crypto have been some of the smartest, most friendly and interesting people I have ever interacted with.  I know WAGMI and from the bottom of my heart think together we will make the world a better place.  Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit more about me.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/@evmavericks\">Subscribe to our paragraph to get these interviews &amp; more sooner</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-08 13:21:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lw5b3li","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gmbv28","parent_id":"t3_1gmbv28","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Jey_s_TeArS","body":">**Know where you belong,** \n\n>**Bangkok transit from Hong-Kong,** \n\n>**You're getting along.** \n\n\n~Daily haiku until we\u2019re at least at 0.178 on the ETH/BTC ratio or highest market cap","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Know where you belong,</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Bangkok transit from Hong-Kong,</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>You&#39;re getting along.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>~Daily haiku until we\u2019re at least at 0.178 on the ETH/BTC ratio or highest market cap</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-08 13:25:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lw5bv5v","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gmbv28","parent_id":"t3_1gmbv28","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-08 17:57:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lw6nt8s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gmbv28","parent_id":"t3_1gmbv28","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/elixir_knight","body":"French regulators would disagree","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>French regulators would disagree</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-08 18:15:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lw6qqsq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gmbv28","parent_id":"t1_lw6nt8s","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/vlatkovr","body":"That makes it amazing.

I'll keep it crypto-focused, but if it's still too political, mods please delete.\n\nI like number-go-up as much as the rest of you, but I am convinced the election results are *not* going to be favorable for the cypherpunk ideals that this space, and especially Ethereum, is founded on. Ethereum exists to be a decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant, credibly neutral global settlement layer. I fear that all of those goals will face significant headwinds in the coming years. Let me give a few examples.\n\n**The FCC will be kneecapped.** We all remember Ajit Pai and the death of net neutrality. That era will come roaring back. ISPs will be free once again to throttle data rates based on the contents of that data, and will be free to impose data caps in all states, even ones that currently do not permit them (any challenges will rise to the supreme court and be thrown out). This will have serious implications for solo stakers trying to stake from home; we need terabytes of data monthly to operate and that will become much more expensive or outright impossible. Decentralization of the network will suffer as a result, to say nothing of our general free use of the internet.\n\n**We can no longer expect constructive regulations.** This has a lot of you cheering but it's incredibly bearish IMO. Ethereum and most blockchains are designed to be permissionless, which means that anyone can use them for any purpose. This is a critically important feature to have at a protocol level, but as we have seen, has also led to the incredible flourishing of bad actors in the space; crypto's reputation as being the home of scams is well-deserved. If we want this to ever change, we need good regulations that crack down on the bad actors, without harming that core permissionlessness. \"Anyone can use this tech, but if you use it to do XYZ bad things you will get in trouble.\" But **the president-elect is one of the bad actors we've been trying to get rid of.** He doesn't like crypto for its libertarian properties; he likes it because it's a great place to run the kinds of cons and grifts that form an objectively large part of his business tactics. He has already personally dipped his toe into this a few times, and has made millions off it. He will have zero or negative interest in aiding in the creation of commonsense anti-scam/market manipulation/pump-and-dump regulations. If it happens (e.g. because actually talented and thoughtful people like Hester Pierce happen to be given power) it will be in spite of the administration, not because of it. The space is probably not going to get the regulatory tools to do the cleaning-up it has so badly needed to become truly mainstream.\n\n**Censorship resistance is a threat to authoritarians.** We're all pro-free-speech here, and one of Ethereum's major goals is to enforce that ideal by preventing censorship of transactions (aka speech) at a protocol level. The incoming administration seems to have cultivated an air of being pro-free-speech, and I desperately hope that that goes more than surface deep, but I'm nearly certain it does not. As we see with people like Musk, who vehemently profess to be pro-free-speech, but once in a position of power immediately start censoring anything that is personally unfavorable to them, freedom of speech does not seem to apply as soon as it involves criticism of that authority. For Ethereum, which will be host to the funds and speech of many anti-administration actors in the coming years, that will likely make it a target of the administration. Of course the network itself cannot be wholly shut down, but individual node operators and stakers (such as myself), as well as institutional operators, in the US, can be trivially targeted by an administration with the power to get IP address information from ISPs and to send armed men to your door. This is a scenario I very much hope does not come to pass, but the annals of even recent history are not encouraging. \n\n**Isolationism does not play well with a global settlement layer.** Closing borders and initiating trade wars has formed a core part of the incoming administration's platform. Creating as much friction as possible where people, goods, or money flow across the US border will likely be official policy going forwards. Contrast this with the goal of crypto at large, to create a frictionless means of transferring funds worldwide. Ethereum wants to go a step beyond, by becoming a global settlement layer where not just funds but all types of state can be consistently created and modified from anywhere in the world, in a credibly neutral manner, because the network is hosted by operators worldwide. I foresee significant tensions here. We've seen what the *current* administration has been willing to do, with its OFAC lists of undesirable onchain entities trying to freeze out Russia or privacy tools; we might be about to find out what happens if that expands to include the entire rest of the world. What does enforcing tariffs look like onchain? We might be going there.\n\nWe're all cheering because a \"pro crypto\" administration has been elected, and of course there are clearly some positive aspects - if the SEC stops harassing honest crypto entities like Coinbase or Uniswap that will be *great* - but as a cypherpunk and decentralization maxi I strongly suspect that excitement will prove to have been naive in hindsight. I would *love* to be wrong.\n\nI'm sure you guys will have things to say about this post, and please do; I'll read everything but don't plan to respond. I'm not posting to get into any debates, just to share how one of your fellow Ethfinanciers is feeling the past few days.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have to get this off my chest.
