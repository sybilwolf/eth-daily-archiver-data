Puffer finance has a very special system to attract validators for their LST. As far as I understand, they use validator tickets, which are ERC20 tokens. Each one gives the buyer the right to run a validator for 24 hours. As a node operator you stake them and can then run a node. As a node operator you have to stake at least 28 VTs and 1 ETH worth of pufETH to run a node. The APR of pufETH is directly connected to the sale of these VTs. \n\nSomehow puffer finance started exiting the validator of node operators even though they had enough VT staked and all the right to continue staking. The stakers are stuck with the VT as they cannot go live with it and no new buyers are coming in due to the pufETH depeg. This means everyone is kinda screwed. No new money buying VTs means no money flowing into pufETH, which means 0 APR this most probably will lead to selling off of pufETH. Node operators cannot access their capital as it is stuck in the staking contract until new nodes can be spun up. \n\nThe mechanism sounds very complex and kinda death spirally.

Puffer finance has a very special system to attract validators for their LST. As far as I understand, they use validator tickets, which are ERC20 tokens. Each one gives the buyer the right to run a validator for 24 hours. As a node operator you stake them and can then run a node. As a node operator you have to stake at least 28 VTs and 1 ETH worth of pufETH to run a node. The APR of pufETH is directly connected to the sale of these VTs. </p>\n\n<p>Somehow puffer finance started exiting the validator of node operators even though they had enough VT staked and all the right to continue staking. The stakers are stuck with the VT as they cannot go live with it and no new buyers are coming in due to the pufETH depeg. This means everyone is kinda screwed. No new money buying VTs means no money flowing into pufETH, which means 0 APR this most probably will lead to selling off of pufETH. Node operators cannot access their capital as it is stuck in the staking contract until new nodes can be spun up. </p>\n\n<p>The mechanism sounds very complex and kinda death spirally. We will see how this develops in the coming days and weeks.</p>\n\n<p>jasper on twitter made a long post explaining it and suggestion some remedies:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/drjasper_eth/status/1855104927145632069\">https://x.com/drjasper_eth/status/1855104927145632069</a></p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/drjasper_eth/status/1855104927145632069\">https://xcancel.com/drjasper_eth/status/1855104927145632069</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-09 04:14:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lw8l406","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gn3k7p","parent_id":"t3_1gn3k7p","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timwithnotoolbelt","body":"Remember they had the most joker of a dapp in the beginning.

So for instance you've seen an angry pepe, sad pepe, crazy pepe etc... This is super important with memes.\n\nJoeCoin is a representation of the Emotiguy, the yellow guy with the glasses that you've probably seen at some point. It's a 3D model that can represent any human emotion.\n\nHere's the catch, Pepe is worth 4.5bn and Joe is worth 65M. So I see a huge value disparity and believe Joe can reach 1-2bn easily in the next year. So I just buy and hold with conviction, because I believe in the product and the brand.\n\nBoth coins have a fixed supply and all coins are in circulation, as 99% of the memes.\n\nIn terms of devs, Pepe does have a bit of a shady past but in theory, the shady devs cashed out a long long time ago. With Joe I have personally talked to the dev and he's a nice and trustworthy guy, it's a very small curltish community and everyone follows each other.\n\nPepe: https://etherscan.io/token/0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933\n\nJoe: https://etherscan.io/token/0x76e222b07c53d28b89b0bac18602810fc22b49a8\n\nSo to answer your question, I hold both of these because:\n\n1. They are both viral memes\n1. I genuinely like them and use those memes eveyday\n1. I feel part of a community\n1. They both have survived crashes (-80%) multiple times\n1. They are both are ERC20 tokens\n1. They are both leveraged versions of ETH\n\nIf ETH goes up 10%, Pepe goes up 25%. The charts don't lie.\n\nHope I answered your questions. I have done a lot of homework and literally prefer to hold Pepe vs. a VC coin like Arbitrum. I am an ETH maxi, my biggest holdings are of Ethereum memecoins.\n\nA believe Pepe will reach a marketcap of 80-100bn somewhere in 2025. Because it came out recently (2023), it's the first frog memecoin in a world of dogs, and because even your grandma know who Pepe the frog is.\n\nOther memes I think are good holds:\n\nDogecoin\nMOG (ETH)\nGigachad (Solana)\nLock in (Solana)\nDolan Duck (Solana)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sure no problem.</p>\n\n<p>My highest conviction holds are Pepe and JoeCoin.</p>\n\n<p>Both are similar memes because the character can replicate any human emotion. So for instance you&#39;ve seen an angry pepe, sad pepe, crazy pepe etc... This is super important with memes.</p>\n\n<p>JoeCoin is a representation of the Emotiguy, the yellow guy with the glasses that you&#39;ve probably seen at some point. It&#39;s a 3D model that can represent any human emotion.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the catch, Pepe is worth 4.5bn and Joe is worth 65M. So I see a huge value disparity and believe Joe can reach 1-2bn easily in the next year. So I just buy and hold with conviction, because I believe in the product and the brand.</p>\n\n<p>Both coins have a fixed supply and all coins are in circulation, as 99% of the memes.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of devs, Pepe does have a bit of a shady past but in theory, the shady devs cashed out a long long time ago. With Joe I have personally talked to the dev and he&#39;s a nice and trustworthy guy, it&#39;s a very small curltish community and everyone follows each other.</p>\n\n<p>Pepe: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933\">https://etherscan.io/token/0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933</a></p>\n\n<p>Joe: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0x76e222b07c53d28b89b0bac18602810fc22b49a8\">https://etherscan.io/token/0x76e222b07c53d28b89b0bac18602810fc22b49a8</a></p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question, I hold both of these because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They are both viral memes</li>\n<li>I genuinely like them and use those memes eveyday</li>\n<li>I feel part of a community</li>\n<li>They both have survived crashes (-80%) multiple times</li>\n<li>They are both are ERC20 tokens</li>\n<li>They are both leveraged versions of ETH</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If ETH goes up 10%, Pepe goes up 25%. The charts don&#39;t lie.</p>\n\n<p>Hope I answered your questions. I have done a lot of homework and literally prefer to hold Pepe vs. a VC coin like Arbitrum.
