And hotels too, now that I've moved from Chiang Mai to Bangkok. This schedule is keeping me on my toes. I'll be putting links in a child comment to help debug Reddit issues.\n\nMy second week at Edge City was dominated by *Sequencing Week*. Sequencing Week wasn't a public conference like what I usually report on--it was more of an Aestus responsibility. But at a high level, Sequencing Week got all the teams working on based sequencing and preconfirmations together in one space to share ideas and do some collaborative work on standardization. So like actual work. But to the extent that the deliverables built there are released publicly, I'll try to pass them on. One of the smaller projects there put together a quick L2 Tech Tree which you can scroll around. The Surge rollup was announced partway through the week, which was relevant but wasn't actively worked on there. The rest is still being finalized.\n\nThat kept me pretty busy, and I had no time for the Edge City fun stuff I had done the previous week. Don't think I ever made it back to the coworking space, and no more cold plunge and sauna. So I'm glad I got that first week there to get the real popup village experience.\n\n----\n\nNext was the *Staking Summit* in Bangkok. It was a fairly easy flight from Chiang Mai, aside from a 1-hour delay, and then a smooth ride on public transit to get out to the venue. Staking Summit was my first proper conference of the trip, and this was my second time at their events; [the first](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/17so8sk/daily_general_discussion_november_11_2023/k8tu747/) was at Devconnect in Istanbul last year. The conference is really all about staking, and I mean it. There's plenty of Ethereum PoS representation, including Lido, SSV, Rocket Pool, Symbiotic, various node operators, etc. But any other Ethereum topic is out of scope (e.g. no DeFi), while the staking components of any other chain (including Bitcoin) are *in* scope. For many people here, APY is the number one priority, and blockchains are simply a means to enable it. There was one stage with a steady lineup of talks, and a room with a decent amount of booth space.\n\nI feel like I spent most of my time teaching people about based sequencing and preconfirmations. Probably went through the same explanation 10 times a day. Everyone has heard of those topics but I guess detailed information hasn't been widely propagated. And having come freshly from Sequencing Week, it was all fresh in my mind so everyone was curious. I ran into a number of friends and folks I met at last year's event. Didn't spend as much time in talks as I originally scheduled, but here's an overview:\n\n* Darren Langley, General Manager at Rocket Pool, talked about the Saturn series of protocol upgrades. These have been discussed in some depth on ethfinance, so I don't feel a need to explain everything. But the message of course is scaling scaling scaling. ETH-only minipools are live now as part of Saturn 0. Saturn 1 and 2 in 2025 will bring 4 ETH bonds, megapools, and general reworks to how much of which value flows to which participants.\n* Will Shannon, Head of Strategic Initiatives at Lido, gave a general overview and update on Lido's decentralization efforts. I don't think much has changed since I last saw him talk at EthCC. But current situation is that their Simple DVT module is at 4% of total Lido stake allocation (representing over 1% of total ETH stake), and the Community Staking Module (CSM) is live with 1.5 ETH bonds but whitelisted to solo staker lists. CSM aiming to be permissionless in Q1.\n* Amir Forouzani, Co-Founder of Puffer Finance, shared his vision for based appchains being as ubiquitous as smart contracts. As based rollups, these appchains would get the usual scalability benefits, while getting easy access to interoperability with other based rollups and L1. Preconfirmations provide good UX, and their liquid restaking platform helps them get the validator adoption needed to make preconfs work.\n* Lili Feryerabend of Staking Rewards hosted a panel with the founders of MANTRA, Penumbra Labs, and SSV Labs, in which they discussed token issuance. I don't know what their particular qualifications were on the topic, and they didn't cover any particularly novel ground. But in general they seemed to support the idea that issuance is important to incentivize an ecosystem's development, and that while token holders may get diluted, the value that the healthy ecosystem brings to their tokens is well worth the cost.\n* Thunj Chatramonklasri, Expert Fellow at the Center for Cryptoeconomics, presented his research on how stakers have historically reacted to changes in ETH issuance and staking rewards. It felt like a very quick overview of a much more in-depth paper, so I missed a lot of details. But he generally used EIPS to look for historical instances where supply and demand curves were affected, and saw how staking behavior changed before and after them. When looking at dollar reward rate, he found that solo stakers are *less* sensitive than the average to small decreases in dollar rewards. But for big and sudden movements in ETH price, solo stakers are *more* sensitive than the overall population. It will be worthwhile to read the paper once it's out, to better understand the specifics.\n* Vitamelange Butterfly, some guy at the EF, gave his grand vision for Ethereum staking. Honestly, I didn't really find anything new, but it was a nice overview. He focused on staking decentralization to support the L1 as the \"anchor\" of the world computer. Hoping to improve accessibility through reducing the stake requirement and reducing node operator costs via statelessness and SNARKs. It's also possible to reduce the responsibilities of stakers to increase accessibility, but that's a cost to protocol decentralization that must be properly balanced. He noted that out-of-protocol improvements such as squad staking, hardware \"dual-uses\", and app-layer MEV minimization can help improve staking as well.\n* Sunny Aggarwal, Co-Founder of Osmosis, speculated on the possibility of transitioning Bitcoin to proof of stake consensus. Most of the talk covered Bitcoin's security budget problems, which most on ethfinance are knowledgeable about. His solution is to start introducing staking to the BTC ecosystem. Starting with something like Babylon for bitcoin staking to get everyone used to the concept. Then transitioning to a \"soft fork marketplace\", where users would pay mining pools to follow additional rules like issuing preconfirmations, using staking mechanisms to hold them economically accountable. Then finally, that mechanism could be used to transition Bitcoin consensus itself to PoS.\n\nYesterday was supposed to be my one free day, but I ended up attending some Ethereum R&D workshops. Not going to get into the details, but a few workshops I attended covered CL client bandwidth, FOCIL, and ePBS. All very active areas of research! Let's see, I guess I missed DevConflict, which would have been fun, but can't do everything. And today, I had signed up for a few preconf events but just had a meeting and did some relay work instead :).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Devcon &amp; Friends Update 2</strong> (<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1ghq1qr/daily_general_discussion_november_2_2024/luzucs3/\">Previous</a>)</p>\n\n<p><em>Edge City Lanna Week 2 &amp; Staking Summit</em></p>\n\n<p>This last week in Thailand, I&#39;ve been jumping around between a few different events.
