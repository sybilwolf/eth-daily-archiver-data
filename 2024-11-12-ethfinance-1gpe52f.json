I stopped by the venue yesterday to pick up my wristband, which was peaceful and truly the calm before the storm. There are something like 12,000 people with Devcon tickets, so now that everyone has arrived, it's a massive event. It's big and there's a lot going on, so it's possible to spend the better part of a day just wandering around. Today I did have some other responsibilities but spent most of the day at the venue. Made it to some talks, but in the end not too many.\n\nTalks all have a QR code displayed on the side of the screen which you can scan to get access to a Q&A page to submit questions for after the talk, or upvote other people's questions you like. There's also some way to mint a \"card\" NFT thing associated with each talk, but you have to scan this QR code that only appears in person, not on the stream. I didn't manage to get the card minting working on my phone, but the Q&A tech worked well. I was very surprised to see that the conference provided plenty of snacks, beverages, and even a full lunch, and somehow *they didn't run out*. With 12k hungry attendees? Well done organizers.\n\n-------\n\nOh, and the frogs. People love the frogs. This is a Devcon + Zupass initiative to demonstrate use cases of programmable cryptography (in short, prog crypto, hence the name of the project: frogcrypto). In short, on your Devcon ticket there is a link to the frogcrypto page where you can tap a button every 15 minutes to catch a digital frog. The frogs are cryptographic data structures that can be ZK verified in various ways, and last year were a basis for people to implement various demos of progcrypto technology. If you show this frog to the frogcrypto people at the booth, they'll give you a frog plushie on a necklace, with a unique QR code that you can scan to set it up. Then, anyone else can scan your QR code to each get a copy of each other's frogs. The big goal is to catch as many frogs as you can, each one contributing to your score, which you can turn in for prizes. There's the classic frog bucket hat from last year's Devconnect, little frog trinkets of sorts, and among the higher-tier rewards: a programmable cryptography textbook for 300 frogs.\n\nOf course, the QR code is just a URL like any other, so you can always just scan your code, post it to Telegram, and have everyone else click it without having to actually interact in person. I even found a website created just today that lets anyone add their frog URL to a database where everyone can see the full list. So if you can sustain a pace of 4 frogs / minute, that's just 75 minutes of mindless tapping to earn enough to get that textbook. I'm sure by morning people will have written scripts to automatically scrape frogs from the website and automatically connect with them all. Not sure how long the merch will last or if it's worth the effort to collect.\n\n------\n\nA handful of talks today. The Devcon schedule is fantastic for providing info about each talk and speaker, and *actually contains an embedded YouTube video of each talk today*. Amazing. Here:\n\n* Josef Je, Co-founder of PWN DAO & Bordel hackerspace, argued that crypto isn't some fantasy land disconnected from the \"real world\", it *is* the real world. You can compare onchain revenue like priority fees to other industies' revenues, or compare onchain market capitalization with those of other industries. By those metrics, crypto--purely based on on-chain metrics--is a similar scale as the gaming and entertainment industries. One difference is that the number of people directly working in crypto itself is much lower than those other industries. Josef pointed out to the attendees in the room, \"You are the cryptonative economy!\"\n* Diego Kingston, Co-founder and head of research at Aligned, delivered a lightning talk (only 7 minutes!) on hash-based proof systems. I could only take notes so fast, so here are the bits and pieces. Hash based proof systems work over smaller fields, do not require trusted setups, and make minimal security assumptions. It is easier than most proving systems to generate recursive proofs, but you need linear error-correcting codes like Reed-Solomon and a collision-resistant hash function. See: FRI, circle starks. Compile to a set of polynomial equations and use a merkle tree to commit and blah blah blah this should have been like 30 minutes not 7.\n* Leo Lara, Team Lead at the EF/PSE, gave a lightning talk on modern ZKP compilers. In short, it sounds like compilers are getting better at including useful abstractions to make developer experience better. But he suggested that zkVMs are probably the future and that most people who want to make use of ZKPs will not write circuits, but instead just write code that compiles down to the VM language (e.g. RISC-V) and prove it with a zkVM.\n* Phil Daian of Flashbots laid out his priorities and roadmap for Ethereum's future. He highlighted his biggest concerns by referencing a paper affiliated with the NY Fed that looked at how to ensure \"regulatory cooperation\" of blockchains, noting MEV-Boost relays as places to apply pressure. Also referenced AWS datacenters and how concentrated they are in the US and Europe.

I stopped by the venue yesterday to pick up my wristband, which was peaceful and truly the calm before the storm. There are something like 12,000 people with Devcon tickets, so now that everyone has arrived, it&#39;s a massive event. It&#39;s big and there&#39;s a lot going on, so it&#39;s possible to spend the better part of a day just wandering around. Today I did have some other responsibilities but spent most of the day at the venue. Made it to some talks, but in the end not too many.</p>\n\n<p>Talks all have a QR code displayed on the side of the screen which you can scan to get access to a Q&amp;A page to submit questions for after the talk, or upvote other people&#39;s questions you like. There&#39;s also some way to mint a &quot;card&quot; NFT thing associated with each talk, but you have to scan this QR code that only appears in person, not on the stream. I didn&#39;t manage to get the card minting working on my phone, but the Q&amp;A tech worked well. I was very surprised to see that the conference provided plenty of snacks, beverages, and even a full lunch, and somehow <em>they didn&#39;t run out</em>. With 12k hungry attendees? Well done organizers.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Oh, and the frogs. People love the frogs. This is a Devcon + Zupass initiative to demonstrate use cases of programmable cryptography (in short, prog crypto, hence the name of the project: frogcrypto). In short, on your Devcon ticket there is a link to the frogcrypto page where you can tap a button every 15 minutes to catch a digital frog. The frogs are cryptographic data structures that can be ZK verified in various ways, and last year were a basis for people to implement various demos of progcrypto technology. If you show this frog to the frogcrypto people at the booth, they&#39;ll give you a frog plushie on a necklace, with a unique QR code that you can scan to set it up. Then, anyone else can scan your QR code to each get a copy of each other&#39;s frogs. The big goal is to catch as many frogs as you can, each one contributing to your score, which you can turn in for prizes. There&#39;s the classic frog bucket hat from last year&#39;s Devconnect, little frog trinkets of sorts, and among the higher-tier rewards: a programmable cryptography textbook for 300 frogs.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the QR code is just a URL like any other, so you can always just scan your code, post it to Telegram, and have everyone else click it without having to actually interact in person. I even found a website created just today that lets anyone add their frog URL to a database where everyone can see the full list. So if you can sustain a pace of 4 frogs / minute, that&#39;s just 75 minutes of mindless tapping to earn enough to get that textbook. I&#39;m sure by morning people will have written scripts to automatically scrape frogs from the website and automatically connect with them all. Not sure how long the merch will last or if it&#39;s worth the effort to collect.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>A handful of talks today. The Devcon schedule is fantastic for providing info about each talk and speaker, and <em>actually contains an embedded YouTube video of each talk today</em>. Amazing. Here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Josef Je, Co-founder of PWN DAO &amp; Bordel hackerspace, argued that crypto isn&#39;t some fantasy land disconnected from the &quot;real world&quot;, it <em>is</em> the real world. You can compare onchain revenue like priority fees to other industies&#39; revenues, or compare onchain market capitalization with those of other industries. By those metrics, crypto--purely based on on-chain metrics--is a similar scale as the gaming and entertainment industries. One difference is that the number of people directly working in crypto itself is much lower than those other industries. Josef pointed out to the attendees in the room, &quot;You are the cryptonative economy!&quot;</li>\n<li>Diego Kingston, Co-founder and head of research at Aligned, delivered a lightning talk (only 7 minutes!) on hash-based proof systems. I could only take notes so fast, so here are the bits and pieces. Hash based proof systems work over smaller fields, do not require trusted setups, and make minimal security assumptions. It is easier than most proving systems to generate recursive proofs, but you need linear error-correcting codes like Reed-Solomon and a collision-resistant hash function. See: FRI, circle starks. Compile to a set of polynomial equations and use a merkle tree to commit and blah blah blah this should have been like 30 minutes not 7.</li>\n<li>Leo Lara, Team Lead at the EF/PSE, gave a lightning talk on modern ZKP compilers. In short, it sounds like compilers are getting better at including useful abstractions to make developer experience better. But he suggested that zkVMs are probably the future and that most people who want to make use of ZKPs will not write circuits, but instead just write code that compiles down to the VM language (e.g. RISC-V) and prove it with a zkVM.</li>\n<li>Phil Daian of Flashbots laid out his priorities and roadmap for Ethereum&#39;s future. He highlighted his biggest concerns by referencing a paper affiliated with the NY Fed that looked at how to ensure &quot;regulatory cooperation&quot; of blockchains, noting MEV-Boost relays as places to apply pressure. Also referenced AWS datacenters and how concentrated they are in the US and Europe. So with that his focus is on decentralization of geo-economic distribution of power, which he things should be a first-class goal of Ethereum, much moreso than any performance metrics. He wants to push back against &quot;UX fentanyl&quot; (the addictive need to make end-user UX perfect even at the expense of other core values) and &quot;napkin research&quot; (basically out-of-touch researchers). Rejecting much of the Ethereum roadmap and current research directions, he instead wants to &quot;TEEify&quot; everything in pursuit of this goal of &quot;pushing power to the edges&quot;.</li>\n<li>Justin Drake, researcher at the EF, presented his vision for Ethereum&#39;s next era of consensus via the beam chain.
