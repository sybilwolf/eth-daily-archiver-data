I actually didn't get a chance to stop by the main venue at all today. And that's fine, I've accepted the tradeoffs, it's just *really cool* to spend time at the main Devcon venue. I made it to Lidoconnect for most of the day, then went to an evening session on preconfirmations. I think everyone is getting a little worn out, myself included, but I'm hanging in there and still trying to pack new knowledge (and a lot of people's faces and names) into my poor brain.\n\nLidoconnect was a fairly long trip from my hotel. Fortunately it was just a single train line the whole way out there, and it meant getting out a little further into the suburbs, so kind of fun just to see how Bangkok changes as you travel over a larger distance. But still... did they really need to take a whole Devcon day *and* put the venue so far away?\n\nLidoconnect itself was nice. They had something like 3 parallel stages for talks and panels, some scattered workshop and meeting room space, plenty of snacks, catered lunch, and solid attendance. I met some cool people while just hanging out in the common areas, and, as usual, talked about based sequencing and preconfirmations. I found some time for a handful of talks too:\n\n* Dmitry Gusakov of Lido talked about the community staking module's (CSM) mainnet debut. Not much is new, but there was some general celebration of how far it's come. My one note was that there is a set of changes targeted for deployment in summer 2025, which include even lower bond requirements, higher reward efficiency, additional support for onboarding solo stakers, EIP-7002 support, and an improved performance oracle.\n* Christine Kim hosted a panel with Jon Charbonneau, Konstantin Lomashuk, and (surprise guest!) Justin Drake talking about liquid staking's next chapter. On the topic of issuance changes, Jon suggested that there should be a high bar for making changes and that the existing policy is good enough that it's not worth it. Justin explained the risks of the high-issuance all-eth-is-staked endgame, from government taxes on issuance being a drain on the whole validator set, to unit of account being captured by a LST. Konstantin seemed to dislike the concept of minimum viable issuance but IMHO, spoke mostly gibberish; I was listening closely and trying *so hard* to understand him and take notes, and it just did not come through as coherent to me, sorry \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af. On ETH vs LSTs, Jon would prefer a hypothetical world where 100% of ETH is staked through Lido, but only where he could trust Lido governance were perfect. That would be much better than having like 40% of ETH staked but most of it controlled by BlackRock. Jon is also not sure an issuance change will meaningfully change the equilibrium of state composition. Justin thinks a stake cap should be no more than 50% so that even in a worst case scenario, there is still more raw ETH than LSTs. Jon thinks solo staker count is going to decline as inefficiencies are reduced, and that maybe eventually we will need to *explicitly* identify and reward small operators. Justin pitched his fish+zen+feather staking vision for the beam chain, instead arguing that we will soon be entering the golden age of solo staking.\n* Alon Muroch of SSV Network gave a quick pitch for a new Lido module: SSVLM. Lido already has a SimpleDVT module with 57k ETH and ~200 operators, using both SSV and Obol clusters, but scale and coordination create a glass ceiling. The SSVLM they're proposing would have permissionless operators (unlike SimpleDVT) and a dedicated allocation amount, bringing 1-5k new operators (similar to CSM's levels of onboarding). He showed a (apparently fully functional) website mockup for how it would work. And it wasn't said explicitly, but I think it was implied: Obol isn't invited?\n* Eugene Pshenichny, Contributor to Lido, and Max Resnick of Consensys SMG, held a fireside chat about preconfirmations. Eugene generally took an optimistic outlook, citing the usual benefits like faster confirmation UX without needing a centralized sequencer, synchronous composability between based L2s, and something we can build out-of-protocol now without waiting for Ethereum protocol development. Max was more cautious, especially around execution preconfs. He wondered how proposers can do proper pricing, and noted that similar systems on Solana devolve into spam and actually lead to a *worse* UX. He thinks we need more improvements to Ethereum L1 before based rollups can be successful, and that other shared sequencing tools can fill the gap for now. It's very hard to predict how the economics will play out, and it takes time, e.g. MEV-Boost started with a decent set of builders but now it's collapsed to basically just two. Max mentioned that user research at Consensys found when people send transactions they tend to just sit there and anxiously watch the submission window until a confirmation comes through, so expects that there will be significant demand for inclusion preconfs.\n\nThat was all for Lidoconnect for me. I didn't want to stay there all day. In the evening I attended an event called \"Preconfirm the Next Gen Ethereum UX\", organized by imToken, Luban, and Taiko. There were a few short talks, followed by a few panels each focusing on a different set of actors (wallets, based sequencing protocols, and builders). I'm actually not going to go into details on those talks and panels. Honestly I've just been working heavily on these topics, and explaining them in detail, nonstop for like a month, and I'm not learning anything new from these talks. What I *do* plan to do is write up a full 1-3 post explainer of my take on based sequencing and preconfirmations. Probably at some point during Hodlercon. So if you're curious I will provide all the details, I just don't feel the need to provide a summary of *someone else's* explanations.\n\nAs I was writing this, Justin Drake published a [Twitter post](https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1857083454011101600) celebrating the **first based preconfirmations on mainnet**! This was one of the projects initiated during sequencing week, and while there were a few shortcuts in getting these mainnet preconfs, there weren't a ton. It was an execution of the actual flow of data between the proposer, routers, gateway, relays, and builders and it's somewhat miraculous that it went as smoothly as it did. There will probably be more complete summaries later. And notably, Aestus deployed one of the two preconf-aware relays that helped get this block built properly \ud83d\ude0e.\n\n-------\n\nTomorrow, I need to stop by the main venue to pick up my pajama pants, since they've been out of my size and have been waiting on a delivery of more. But most of the day is at *Sequencing Day*, one last event to talk about based sequencing and preconfs yet again one more time. There will probably be some good presentations about where all the various Sequencing Week initiatives ended up. Then on Saturday I'm off to Phuket. So I guess we're in the final stages of this trip!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Devcon &amp; Friends Update 5</strong> (<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1gq6ahm/daily_general_discussion_november_13_2024/lwyo2s0/\">Previous</a>)</p>\n\n<p><em>Devcon Day 3</em></p>\n\n<p>Today was heavy on side events for me.

What I <em>do</em> plan to do is write up a full 1-3 post explainer of my take on based sequencing and preconfirmations. Probably at some point during Hodlercon. So if you&#39;re curious I will provide all the details, I just don&#39;t feel the need to provide a summary of <em>someone else&#39;s</em> explanations.</p>\n\n<p>As I was writing this, Justin Drake published a <a href=\"https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1857083454011101600\">Twitter post</a> celebrating the <strong>first based preconfirmations on mainnet</strong>! This was one of the projects initiated during sequencing week, and while there were a few shortcuts in getting these mainnet preconfs, there weren&#39;t a ton. It was an execution of the actual flow of data between the proposer, routers, gateway, relays, and builders and it&#39;s somewhat miraculous that it went as smoothly as it did. There will probably be more complete summaries later. And notably, Aestus deployed one of the two preconf-aware relays that helped get this block built properly \ud83d\ude0e.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Tomorrow, I need to stop by the main venue to pick up my pajama pants, since they&#39;ve been out of my size and have been waiting on a delivery of more. But most of the day is at <em>Sequencing Day</em>, one last event to talk about based sequencing and preconfs yet again one more time. There will probably be some good presentations about where all the various Sequencing Week initiatives ended up. Then on Saturday I&#39;m off to Phuket. So I guess we&#39;re in the final stages of this trip!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-14 08:06:16","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-11-14 08:47:22","id":"lx3rvks","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gqybdj","parent_id":"t3_1gqybdj","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/austonst","body":"Relevant Links\n\n* [Devcon 2024](https://devcon.org/en/)\n* [Devcon Schedule](https://app.devcon.org/schedule)\n* [Lidoconnect](https://lidoconnect.lido.fi/)\n* [Preconfirm the Next Gen Ethereum UX](https://lu.ma/p1v3zyp7)\n* [Preconfs on Mainnet](https://x.com/drakefjustin/status/1857083454011101600)\n\nI guess not much today.
