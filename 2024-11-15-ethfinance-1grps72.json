That went by fast. Today I did get to visit the main venue first thing in the morning, but only briefly. I had a ticket to pick up some Ethereum pajama pants at the swag desk. They had been out of my size both previous times I checked, but suggested that Friday morning they should have enough in stock, and sure enough, they did! Got my pants. I also made one final stop at the frogcrypto booth, where I was able to show my total sum of ~200 collected frogs to pick up some goodies. They were out of bucket hats (got a voucher for next time!), but I did get the one thing I really wanted: a short 100 page textbook on programmable cryptography put together by 0xPARC. It's a cool souvenir and good quick reference. There's some alternative timeline where I didn't start the relay, got bored, and decided to pledge myself to the moon math. But in this life I can tell you all about kubernetes and MEV instead.\n\nI spent all my time at Sequencing Day. I was a little skeptical heading over there at first, because there have been a lot of sequencing talks and events all with the same crowd and same content as I've been immersed in the last few weeks. But this one was actually good! It had always been billed as the premier, more official sequencing event, in part due to some Justin Drake coordination. So the talks were generally solid and it was in some ways the last hurrah after a few weeks of effort.\n\nGetting into it. I don't think these summaries will be particularly friendly to those without a somewhat solid understanding already, sorry. But here we go:\n\n* Justin Drake celebrated how the based sequencing efforts have reached escape velocity. He reviewed the history of based rollup and preconfirmation research, from the early posts on ethresear.ch in May and November of 2023, through the regular sequencing & preconfs calls, and up through the recent demonstration of preconfirmations on mainnet. He listed out the other deliverables worked on during Sequencing Week, not many of which are really ready to fully publish but most of which have at least reached a good draft state. In total: gateway API standards ERC, universal registration contract, based sequencing .org educational website, L2beat-style classification for preconf protocols, shared blobs and compression, (re)staking partnerships, the mainnet proof of concept, the tech tree, and interop standards. Justin has found that while many people start out skeptical of based sequencing, over time most become \"based-pilled\". His hope is that now the ecosystem has reached \"escape velocity\", in the sense that he can shift his focus to the beam chain and the teams that have been set in motion can finish the rest.\n* Shea Ketsdever of Flashbots argued that the best path forward for block building is with decentralized builders. She criticizes centralized sequencers, as one should, but also thinks that based sequencing kind of reintroduces centralization just because the sophistication required to compete on multi-chain MEV is so high that it becomes centralizing. Preconfirmations have the risk of exacerbating exclusive order flow, accelerating L1 centralization. On the other hand, she argued that decentralized block building, via a network of TEEs, is the way forward. This network would be highly available and provide censorship resistance and verifiable ordering rules. These could power what she called \"built rollups\". The message was that in working on interoperability solutions, make sure not to lose decentralization.\n* Max Resnick of Consensys gave an update on the BRAID multiple concurrent proposer (MCP) system. Most of it was a repeat of what he's covered before, with one new section. He sees MEV not as a problem of ordering but of censorship. BRAID addresses this by having multiple parallel chains, each with a copy of Ethereum's consensus model, all using the same validator set. Each subchain is voted on separately, and once consensus on each is reached for a slot, the actual Ethereum block is created with a *union* of the transactions in each subchain. Thus, if someone wants to censor your transaction, they would have to coerce all of the proposers: any one of them could include you. The new stuff is about how to ensure that all the subchains release their subblocks at the same time. Four options, in increasing technical difficulty: commit-reveal, commit-reveal w/ force open, threshold encryption, and delay encryption. He thinks the most realistic today is commit-reveal with force open, but details are TBD.\n* Cecilia Zhang of Taiko explained the details of how Gwyneth works. This is a protocol for *synchronous composability* between *based L2s*. More commonly, *asynchronous* composability protocols use message passing to communicate between L2s, but in a based world we can do better. Gwyneth rollups introduce a new opcode which allows for *context switching*, which allows you to write solidity code that executes on multiple L2s, switching between them as needed to execute logic. The sequencer needs to be sophisticated enough to handle all this, but it's doable. Gwyneth will support message passing as needed when leaving the based world, but that's not as fun. To get synchronous composability with L1, we'll need real-time proving so that proofs of state changes can be passed around between the various chains. For now, TEEs can work well enough to generate what they're calling \"Glue Proofs\"--ZKPs would be better but they're not fast enough yet.\n* Rohan Shrothrium of Kuru presented some mathematical modeling of MEV in order to determine if it's worth it for proposers to accept preconfirmation requests, or if it's more profitable to wait until the end of a slot and just run PBS as we see it today. He laid out a model, moving probably a little too quickly though it because I missed some variable definitions and could not keep up with note taking. Notably, he assumes MEV opportunities follow a Poisson distribution, the value of issuing a preconf for a MEV opportunity decays over time, and proposer behavior can be modeled with some parameter for how long they wait, and some parameter for their minimum preconf fee. With the model written out, when preconf fees are 0, there's obviously no incentive to provide frequent preconfs (I guess this is more of a sanity check for the model). But then as long as there is some sufficient threshold of demand for preconfs, then there is an incentive to provide them quickly and not wait. Probably an obvious answer, but I would guess we just didn't get into the details enough to see the nuance.\n* Sam Battenally of Rise talked about the value of open based sequencing. To him, the real benefits of based sequencing are synchronous composability and credible neutrality. An *open* based ecosystem would ideally be permissionless, have synchronous composability across the whole range of rollups, have cost mostly comparable to centralized sequencers, be DA agnostic, and have minimal bootstrapping cost. To achieve this, option 1: gateways are sequencers for rollups--this becomes a bottleneck and needs permissioned training wheels. Option 2: rollups become their own gateways--this requires massive validator adoption. Option 3: gateways further delegate responsibility to third-party sequencers--this separates out the two roles and is his preferred solution. He wants to see based rollups work together on proof aggregation and cross-domain synchronous composability.\n\nSplit due to character limit.

There's always one or two days at each conference where I go over the 10k character limit. I had been hitting ~7k consistently, so I was wondering if this was going to be the trip that broke that trend but I guess not.\n\n* Yaoqi Jia of AltLayer compared based rollups to their alternative: restaked rollups. These construct a validator set from operators using restaked ETH through e.g. EigenLayer for economic security. They use a separate AVS, the MACH Network, for fast finality. There were also mentions of a ZK fraud proof system to replace the usual bisection protocols, and some mention of TEE provers. u/KuDeTa wants me to also note that AltLayer AVSs are very strictly whitelisted (generally only open to the biggest operators by total stake), a concerning trend in the AVS space as it creates centralizing pressure on the operator set, but that's a topic for another day.\n* Matthew Edelen of Spire covered Ethereum's strong network effects. Defining network effects as \"anything that makes a certain network more valuable than another, that are correlated with the size of the network\". His list for Ethereum is: stablecoin adoption, TVL, developers (including onboarding of new devs), contract innovation (71% of all contract code is first deployed on Ethereum), the research and dev community, native ETH asset strength, and global reach. Having lots of people working on new things at the same time, or *parallel innovation* is fast and good, but it fragments these network effects. He wants to see innovations building on top of *shared* network effects, extending the strong L1 network effects to L2s innovating in parallel. And so some good things are: coordinated and shared/based sequencing, synchronous composability, and real-time proving as an enabling tech.\n* Kubi & Lorenzo of Gattaca (known for the Titan builder and relay) tried to ease some centralization concerns. They argued that while MEV-Boost democratized access to MEV yield, it does not have sufficient oversight and proposers had to sacrifice control. Preconfs, via proposer commitment modules, have more accountability through constraint verification and slashing for safety faults. L1 block production with preconfs, they claim, is decentralized, especially if the proposer runs an inclusion list module and delegates preconf routes to multiple gateways. The final block is built by the collaborative work of all these entities; the builder just puts all the results together. They explained how their gateway software is architectured, and showed a live demo of their (proprietary) simulator. The numbers they listed were 13 gigagas/s on a consumer grade PC, < 1 us per tx, and 2 ms block sealing time.\n\nI've said this before, but I wish I got a little more time at Devcon itself. My impression is that everything was really well organized, and it actually makes a big difference on the overall experience to have the little issues mostly smoothed out. Always good vibes, interesting people, and talks with some depth to them. But today, looking back on the combination of Edge City, Sequencing Week, and a preconf-focused Devcon, it reminds me of summer camps growing up. Those were always great: more chill than school and with fun activities and playing with new friends for a week or two. Preconf summer camp wasn't an average Devcon attendance experience, but it was still pretty cool.\n\nI leave for Phuket tomorrow--it's Hodlercon time! I am very ready to spend a week doing a whole lot of nothing. There will be time for plenty of hanging out and fun events too, but I am in need of some days with very little to do. Looking forward to it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Picking up where I left off. There&#39;s always one or two days at each conference where I go over the 10k character limit.

There were also mentions of a ZK fraud proof system to replace the usual bisection protocols, and some mention of TEE provers. <a href=\"/u/KuDeTa\">u/KuDeTa</a> wants me to also note that AltLayer AVSs are very strictly whitelisted (generally only open to the biggest operators by total stake), a concerning trend in the AVS space as it creates centralizing pressure on the operator set, but that&#39;s a topic for another day.</li>\n<li>Matthew Edelen of Spire covered Ethereum&#39;s strong network effects. Defining network effects as &quot;anything that makes a certain network more valuable than another, that are correlated with the size of the network&quot;. His list for Ethereum is: stablecoin adoption, TVL, developers (including onboarding of new devs), contract innovation (71% of all contract code is first deployed on Ethereum), the research and dev community, native ETH asset strength, and global reach. Having lots of people working on new things at the same time, or <em>parallel innovation</em> is fast and good, but it fragments these network effects. He wants to see innovations building on top of <em>shared</em> network effects, extending the strong L1 network effects to L2s innovating in parallel. And so some good things are: coordinated and shared/based sequencing, synchronous composability, and real-time proving as an enabling tech.</li>\n<li>Kubi &amp; Lorenzo of Gattaca (known for the Titan builder and relay) tried to ease some centralization concerns. They argued that while MEV-Boost democratized access to MEV yield, it does not have sufficient oversight and proposers had to sacrifice control. Preconfs, via proposer commitment modules, have more accountability through constraint verification and slashing for safety faults. L1 block production with preconfs, they claim, is decentralized, especially if the proposer runs an inclusion list module and delegates preconf routes to multiple gateways. The final block is built by the collaborative work of all these entities; the builder just puts all the results together. They explained how their gateway software is architectured, and showed a live demo of their (proprietary) simulator. The numbers they listed were 13 gigagas/s on a consumer grade PC, &lt; 1 us per tx, and 2 ms block sealing time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve said this before, but I wish I got a little more time at Devcon itself. My impression is that everything was really well organized, and it actually makes a big difference on the overall experience to have the little issues mostly smoothed out. Always good vibes, interesting people, and talks with some depth to them. But today, looking back on the combination of Edge City, Sequencing Week, and a preconf-focused Devcon, it reminds me of summer camps growing up. Those were always great: more chill than school and with fun activities and playing with new friends for a week or two. Preconf summer camp wasn&#39;t an average Devcon attendance experience, but it was still pretty cool.</p>\n\n<p>I leave for Phuket tomorrow--it&#39;s Hodlercon time! I am very ready to spend a week doing a whole lot of nothing. There will be time for plenty of hanging out and fun events too, but I am in need of some days with very little to do. Looking forward to it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-15 09:22:02","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-11-15
