Some security caveats to consider though that I go over in my comment 2 years ago during the ledger debacle:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13ivi8v/comment/jkgbqne/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button%C2%A0\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13ivi8v/comment/jkgbqne/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\u00a0</a></p>\n\n<p>Basically Trezors can only generate 12 word seed phrases (unless you do advanced CLI stuff), but you can restore 24 word phrases. So if you buy a Trezor and want a 24 word seed phrase then it\u2019s best you use some old wiped Ledger plugged into the wall (so it never connects to laptop/internet) to generate a new 24 word phrase, then restore it on your new Trezor. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As for which Trezor model to buy there are caveats too which my comment goes over.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: If you just use standard 12/24 word wallets then you can get the newest Trezor 3 (has secure element so can\u2019t be physically exploited like older models). If you use 24 words + 25th word pass phrase I\u2019d get the Trezor Model T (cause it allows you to input the 25th word on the touchscreen, all other models require you to type the 25th word on your laptop).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-16 05:26:56","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-11-16 05:31:54","id":"lxfgc7l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gsgu9w","parent_id":"t1_lxfccm1","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CaptainLoud","body":"I appreciate the details!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I appreciate the details!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-16 05:39:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lxfi5rc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gsgu9w","parent_id":"t1_lxfgc7l","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/UgotTrisomy21","body":"FYI looks like this summer they updated to a new 20 word recovery phrase for their latest models when generating a new wallet (so the default is no longer 12 words via bip39, but you can still restore 12/24 word phrases)\n\nhttps://blog.trezor.io/20-word-wallet-backup-your-questions-answered-bff078922644","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>FYI looks like this summer they updated to a new 20 word recovery phrase for their latest models when generating a new wallet (so the default is no longer 12 words via bip39, but you can still restore 12/24 word phrases)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.trezor.io/20-word-wallet-backup-your-questions-answered-bff078922644\">https://blog.trezor.io/20-word-wallet-backup-your-questions-answered-bff078922644</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-18 06:26:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lxrcsnc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gsgu9w","parent_id":"t1_lxfi5rc","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CaptainLoud","body":"Ok excellent, this is what i was hoping for - thank you!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ok excellent, this is what i was hoping for - thank you!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-18 07:48:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lxrr98s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gsgu9w","parent_id":"t1_lxrcsnc","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/epic_trader","body":"I was unable to update my ledger nano s past some point and the only way I was able to withdraw the funds was connecting via myetherwallet and changing the derivation path.
