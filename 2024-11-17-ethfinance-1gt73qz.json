Transactions simply failing because the network can&#39;t handle them. It&#39;s like a thousand people wanting to send letters and the post office saying &quot;nah we&#39;re at capacity, we&#39;ll throw half the letters in the shredder, try to write a new letter tomorrow&quot;. Absolute garbage design.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>why do you think companies do stock splits?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Companies do stock splits because you can&#39;t own partial stocks. That&#39;s not unit bias, it&#39;s the fact that only full units actually <strong>count</strong> with stocks.</p>\n\n<p>That is not to say that unit bias doesn&#39;t exist, it sure does, because humans are fucking stupid. I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s not a legit or sustainable reason for something to be of higher value than something else. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>yes, so I was correct? More volume on the one centralized chain where it can be. How is this an argument against usability?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Correct on what? You were giving reasons for &quot;why Solana keeps going up&quot; (the original question). </p>\n\n<p>I cannot make a statement about whether it&#39;s &quot;correct&quot; or not that Solana keeps going up because &quot;no L2 fragmentation&quot;. And I didn&#39;t make any argument here about &quot;usability&quot;. My point was that &quot;no L2 fragmentation&quot; is only a thing on Solana because it&#39;s too immature to even begin dealing with this problem. But it will have to if it keeps growing. And then this alleged benefit is moot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It means always acting like you are the correct one, talking down to others, calling everything scam and shitcoins and think like &quot;eventually we will be right, that will show them!&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That sounds more like Bitcoiners, not generally Ethereum people. Might just be my experience though.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-18 09:26:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lxsa5pg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gt73qz","parent_id":"t1_lxqe3i0","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Order_Book_Facts","body":"I agree with you, the self-righteousness of the ETH community is off putting.
