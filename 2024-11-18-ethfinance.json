Well, it does seem very likely, and I agree that this *probably* will happen.\n\nBut the reality is that we see alts pumping before a significant move from ETH, and we just have to accept that this bull run might just skip it. I mean, SOL is already 25x from its bear market low, how high can the market really go?\n\nI've wondered publicly here many times if I was wrong on my thesis. And after every analysis, my verdict was that I was not.\n\nWell, I can now pretty confidently say that I was *very* wrong, but there's a catch.\n\nI was wrong on my thesis of what drives a coin to appreciate in value, but *not* wrong on which coin has the best fundamentals. It is now abundantly clear that Crypto is still a place governed by hopes, dreams and memes, and not much else, as is evident by the total lack of appreciation for the only coin that did everything \"right\". From the scaling roadmap that it delivered on, to going completely carbon-free, to the focus on decentralization, to the adoption by several companies. None of that matters.\n\nBTC Maxis like to say that Bitcoin is King, but in reality, Marketing and number go up is King. And even though the public image of Ethereum is now atrocious and getting worse each day, it might be *too* decentralized to effectively organize some kind of marketing.\n\nSo, my \"DYOR\" was correct, but I was still retarded for not seeing this market for what it is and thinking that it had matured.\n\nAt this point, even if ETH pumps 10x, it will still be a fact that people that held through countless risky, potentially blockchain-breaking upgrades were just not rewarded for that risk. EIP-1559, the Merge, Shanghai, all were very tricky to pull off. And apparently, instead of taking that risk, the correct move was to throw a dart at the the charts and go all in at the first coin it landed.\n\nWell, I'm not going to do that. If I want a Casino, I'd rather go to Vegas rather than buy PNUT and PEPE and hope the scammers owning half the supply are kind enough to pump them for me. At least at a real Casino there are free drinks and I can get shitfaced while losing money. And I'm sure as hell not going to pump Toly's bags at $250 a pop.

Well, it does seem very likely, and I agree that this <em>probably</em> will happen.</p>\n\n<p>But the reality is that we see alts pumping before a significant move from ETH, and we just have to accept that this bull run might just skip it. I mean, SOL is already 25x from its bear market low, how high can the market really go?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve wondered publicly here many times if I was wrong on my thesis. And after every analysis, my verdict was that I was not.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I can now pretty confidently say that I was <em>very</em> wrong, but there&#39;s a catch.</p>\n\n<p>I was wrong on my thesis of what drives a coin to appreciate in value, but <em>not</em> wrong on which coin has the best fundamentals. It is now abundantly clear that Crypto is still a place governed by hopes, dreams and memes, and not much else, as is evident by the total lack of appreciation for the only coin that did everything &quot;right&quot;. From the scaling roadmap that it delivered on, to going completely carbon-free, to the focus on decentralization, to the adoption by several companies. None of that matters.</p>\n\n<p>BTC Maxis like to say that Bitcoin is King, but in reality, Marketing and number go up is King. And even though the public image of Ethereum is now atrocious and getting worse each day, it might be <em>too</em> decentralized to effectively organize some kind of marketing.</p>\n\n<p>So, my &quot;DYOR&quot; was correct, but I was still retarded for not seeing this market for what it is and thinking that it had matured.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, even if ETH pumps 10x, it will still be a fact that people that held through countless risky, potentially blockchain-breaking upgrades were just not rewarded for that risk. EIP-1559, the Merge, Shanghai, all were very tricky to pull off. And apparently, instead of taking that risk, the correct move was to throw a dart at the the charts and go all in at the first coin it landed.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I&#39;m not going to do that.
