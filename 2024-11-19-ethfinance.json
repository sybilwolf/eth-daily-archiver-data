Not overall, I don&#39;t have a bone in my body that says if blockchains succeed I&#39;m wrong about eth, eth will be the clear winner, I&#39;m sure of it.  But what if I&#39;m wrong about this cycle.  Can I wait another 4 years?  Assuming with this administration cycles are still even a thing?</p>\n\n<p>I do think the pessimism needs to stop, the whining needs to stop (myself included) but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just bad traders who are feeling this.  I mentioned earlier this was meant to be my last cycle before retirement and I&#39;m stuck with the fear of...what if we drastically underperform?  As I said, I think given the market it&#39;s a normal human response...but one that should probably be kept in check until there&#39;s a legit reason to fear the boat isn&#39;t going to sail this cycle.  We&#39;ve been here before and it worked out.  I was frustrated then too before being elated. </p>\n\n<p>Edit; I guess I say all this to say, in this situation, I think fear is normal, frustration is normal...but I agree we should probably tone it down.  It&#39;s out of hand and I&#39;m just as guilty.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-19 12:51:17","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-11-19 13:02:57","id":"lxzm9jl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1guqj19","parent_id":"t1_lxzjpn7","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hedgemagus","body":"both of you are right.

I bought a modest amount of SOL, much earlier this year, and was roundly mocked here; I used most of that SOL to buy my first house.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the cycle is playing out perfectly, compared to previous cycles, including the deluge of FUD and despondancy about ETH. There were SOLs in previous cycles that withered and died. I do not believe SOL will wither and die, but I also believe ETH will have its moment in the sun.</p>\n\n<p>To those in the number go up crowd that say, re: ratio(s), well, you might as well buy BTC or SOL then instead of ETH, this cycle will prove them correct. Next cycle, who knows. The hope is that tech will produce something that will appease number go up crowd.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll see.</p>\n\n<p>My sell point for ETH remains 7.5k USD, mostly because that&#39;s the number where significant life plans can be put in motion, not because I don&#39;t think it can&#39;t go higher. Everyone has their number.</p>\n\n<p>From there, I&#39;ll hold until the next bear and see where ETH, SOL, and BTC are and invest accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Not financial advice, and I have very little interest in &#39;the tech,&#39; so if that&#39;s your jam, cool by me. But I&#39;m purely number go up.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-19 04:16:47","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-11-19 04:23:04","id":"lxwyuaj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1guqj19","parent_id":"t3_1guqj19","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/HauntedJockStrap88","body":"I can\u2019t desk shit until 15K so I reject your narrative","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I can\u2019t desk shit until 15K so I reject your narrative</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-19 05:21:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lxx7ruv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1guqj19","parent_id":"t1_lxwyuaj","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I'm rooting for you, if not that desk :O","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m rooting for you, if not that desk :O</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-19 05:26:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lxx8ja7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1guqj19","parent_id":"t1_lxx7ruv","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/earthquakequestion","body":"I would hate for that to be true, but it does seem like eth missed a rotational period that did seem to flow into sol.

Clap along. &quot;We hold these truths...&quot; To what? Where&#39;s the meat? We can&#39;t see it! The poor people have to extrapolate the utility for themselves. Oh, the literate elites can see the promise, but to no avail. It could have been so great, but no good will come of this. Unflippable.</p>\n\n<p>Bit-Coin, now there&#39;s a trochee; boom, snappy, job done. Strong forward momentum in a word. And so easy to remember; &quot;One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish&quot;. Plus it means something - &quot;coin&quot;, lovely word, gets the point across, this is MONEY, people! &quot;Bit&quot; - that&#39;s computers and tech and the future. </p>\n\n<p>Ethereum, doesn&#39;t even sound solid, not a real thing. A theory, an e-theory, not a real dependable object like a coin. Even those who connect with the concept of the aether, know it&#39;s a wisp, smoke in a bottle. And for the death-knell, after the e-theory comes the hesitation, the pause, the feeling of a lack of confidence, the &#39;um...&#39;. How could anyone be compelled to be sure about this stuff? </p>\n\n<p>And what of the myriad pretenders to the pretender. Trochees, dactyls and anapests, the fuckin&#39; lot of &#39;em. Sol-an-a. Sunny, happy, maybe a bit fruity - full of promise. Car-da-no: Going places at a great speed, maybe a poor finish -and we can see that reflected in the price action. These are not winners, but they are hopeful, comforting sounds. The world is full of dreamers, these coins will grift along nicely.</p>\n\n<p>But at the end of the day, people go with what they like the most. Dogs and money. The slam-dunk trochee (we all know the one) will never be flipped by the poor Iambic dimetered Shiba Inu, its fate sylabically sealed since inception.</p>\n\n<p>IMX, TIA, OP, see &#39;em all huddled together in mid marketcaps - pack up now boys, it&#39;s already over. O-ver.</p>\n\n<p>Q.E.D. third place for ETH.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s just a theory. An e-theory. Um....</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-19 12:35:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lxzj0li","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1guqj19","parent_id":"t3_1guqj19","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Dreth","body":"saw water chase amusing air continue long compare include exultant\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>saw water chase amusing air continue long compare include exultant</p>\n\n<p><em>This post was mass deleted and anonymized with <a href=\"https://redact.dev/home\">Redact</a></em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-19 12:52:33","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-05-05 08:53:30","id":"lxzmimg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1guqj19","parent_id":"t1_lxzj0li","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/clark_now","body":"Poe(t)'s Law","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Poe(t)&#39;s Law</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-19 14:32:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ly065kv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1guqj19","parent_id":"t1_lxzmimg","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Belligerent_Chocobo","body":"Is this JBM's new account or something? \ud83d\ude01","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is this JBM&#39;s new account or something? \ud83d\ude01</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-19 17:39:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ly12yk2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1guqj19","parent_id":"t1_lxzj0li","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/lizard-overlord","body":"Sir.
