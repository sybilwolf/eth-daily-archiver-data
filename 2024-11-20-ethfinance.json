I was buying as many $700 BTC as my wife would let me. Then Gox started having major issues and the price was in freefall. I held on, but at some point it started looking like Gox was pretty much insolvent. I sold to wait it out because this was obviously going to be bad for the price for a while.</p>\n\n<p>Then a guy named Charlie Shrem, who was big in the BTC world at the time, tweeted that he could confirm that Gox was fine and not insolvent. The price skyrocketed back. I begrudgingly bought back in at a major loss... then Gox closed down and I was left holding the bag.</p>\n\n<p>I will never forgive Charlie Shrem tweeting that fake ass news tweet. His lie lost me a lot of BTC that I would have had, and by extension a lot of ETH that I would have bought later.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-20 22:18:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ly7oyt7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gviwdw","parent_id":"t1_ly7m45n","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProfStrangelove","body":"That sucks :(  \nDidn't Shrem go to prison though later on?
