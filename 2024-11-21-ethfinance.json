Memecoin casino?\n\nCardano has given the world: Charles Hoskinson podcasts? Vague hype tweets? Vague Influencer Marketing?\n\nCome to Jesus moment for Alt L1's\n\nI am not saying its a bad idea to hold SOL or ADA or that you cant make gains with those coins or others because you DEFINITELY can, as markets are irrational, hype driven/fomo driven, narrative driven, and narratives are relatively easy to shape/create when the vast majority of the users/capital don't keep up with or understand whats going on \"under the hood\" for these chains.\n\nI am saying that the MAJORITY of the valuation of these chains are based on this obscure very techonological metric sometimes called: \"fluff\"\n\nDont believe me?\n\nSolana: When was the last time you did anything on Solana besides trade memecoins? The memecoin casino has the illusion of being \"great\" but it turns out over 98% users in it lose money, 1.9% are breakeven, and .1% are in the green : https://x.com/ethereumintern_/status/1858370172072996889 https://x.com/chainyoda/status/1858319590444704226\n\nFor pete's sake, people on solana call someone who pushes a \"mint\" button to launch a memecoin on pump.fun a \"dev\". A \"developer\".....for pushing a button..... - moment of silence for this one-\n\nDont get me wrong, nothing wrong with consensual gambling, but if all the hype around Solana is that you can \"get rich\" with memecoins when in reality your odds are LITERALLY worse than Vegas, dont you think maybe youre getting just a littttle psyoped? https://x.com/chainyoda/status/1858319590444704226 Especially when the vast majority of the memes that pump are controlled/influenced by the same people that are pushing the narratives on twitter? Food for thought.\n\nMy best analogy for Solana is like if you went to a musical chains tournament, where people hop from one musical chairs game to the next, to the next, to the next, hoping to compound their gains. (except sometimes people pay the DJ and know when the music is gonna stop :P)\n\nThere's also the small matter of Solana seeing one of its largest token unlocks in HISTORY in Q1 of next year, flooding the ecosystem with fresh SOL supply, but we can just ignore that too: https://x.com/DU09BTC/status/1831208124365287642\n\nOh, and you cant build a decentralized financial system on a Vegas foundation.\n\nCardano:\n\nWhere to start, where to start...\n\nWell how about this? Can you name one app on Cardano that you have used? Most people cant, because noone ACTUALLY uses the Cardano chain, not trying to be mean. This is just literally true.\n\nEven their biggest launch some years back, \"Sundaeswap\" that was supposed to rival \"Uniswap\" was a royal failure, with transactions constantly failing and the chain ridiculously congested: https://x.com/cobie/status/1484289864900173825\n\nBut lets give them the benefit of the doubt on that, lets look at other metrics that are important like stablecoins:\n\nTheir native algorithmic stablecoin they created is called \"Djed\", how's that doing?\n\nWell its marketcap rank is 2,275 and its total marketcap is $3.9 million: https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins\n\nFor context Tether USD is $129 billion, so a mere 33,076x bigger than DJED.\n\nSo its safe to say noone uses that either.\n\nAnd then there's the \"questionable\" marketing from the Cardano ecosystem, always \"promising\" these \"obscure/nebulous\" things to get people hyped:\n\nCharles Hoskinson saying \u201cRogan after Goguen\u201d back in 2021, Goguen was their update set to launch in Q2 2021 but \"Rogan\" never happened: https://x.com/equalscash/status/1771275113029120192\n\nCharles now \"insinuating\" he's going to work with the Trump admin next year: https://x.com/AltcoinGordon/status/1855492949863207193\n\nCharles saying he signed an NDA with Spacex: https://x.com/CARDAN0ADA/status/1857474096805638483\n\nHe then clarifies in another video and says he hopes to reveal details in 4-8 weeks but \"we'll see\": https://x.com/angrycryptoshow/status/1858970634258124923\n\nMeanwhile Elon has repeatedly confirmed he will not endorse any specific projects, although he is \"supportive\" of crypto as a whole: https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1787354882791399512 https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1848100967272665154\n\nCharles has also said that he believes bitcoin is \"like a religion, not a real ecosystem\", that \"we dont really need it\", and that he sees Cardano surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum in the future.\n\nAll of these things can appear as just innocent fluff or hype individually, but as a whole paint a much more concerning picture of the sort of \"marketing\" in the Cardano ecosystem, even from the top.\n\nAnd the culmination of all of this ultimately is the \"PSYOP\":\n\nThat while Ethereum has near all time high activity, tvl, inflows, marketshare, devs, dapps, stablecoins, it is pronounced by the popular narrative as \"dead\"\n\nWhile other chains who have foundations built on \"memecoin casino mirages\" and \"fleeting promises\" are propped up by the narrative as \"the future\"\n\nHere's my TL:DR that essentially says as much:\n\nhttps://x.com/etheraider/status/1859089080815849954\n\nAnd to further clarify a \"Psyop\" doesnt have to be some grand conspiracy, there just have to be enough incentives in place and the wheels turn themselves.\n\nI started this post with a point about Bitcoin, and so I'll end it that way.\n\nHistocally in the stock market almost all stocks that hit $90 will hit $100. In the same vein, as soon as Bitcoin hit $90k the market psychologically built in the expectation that it would hit $100k. $100k is the largest historical and psychological barrier we will have seen to date with BTC, so until that moment arrives all eyes are on $BTC.\n\nHowever once BTC hits 100k, the risk reward perception completely changes, the adjusted risk/reward for Bitcoin to 2x to 200k vs drop 50% to 50k becomes much more \"even\" and the exuberance for bitcoin has a very good chance of \"tapering off\"\n\nAnd everytime bitcoin has tapered off in a bull, guess what happens? Eth skyrockets. But don't take my word for it, go check the charts going back multiple cycles.\n\nIts always darkest before the dawn, the facemelting is only facemelting because it rips up suddenly when people least expect it, AKA when the FUD is at its peak.\n\nDo with this what you will, believe it or not, makes no difference to me, but just know the narrative is slowly changing.\n\nSlowly, then all at once: https://x.com/LayahHeilpern/status/1858587934943048172","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"/u/etheraider\">/u/etheraider</a> I have your post still opened from cc.

This is just literally true.</p>\n\n<p>Even their biggest launch some years back, &quot;Sundaeswap&quot; that was supposed to rival &quot;Uniswap&quot; was a royal failure, with transactions constantly failing and the chain ridiculously congested: <a href=\"https://x.com/cobie/status/1484289864900173825\">https://x.com/cobie/status/1484289864900173825</a></p>\n\n<p>But lets give them the benefit of the doubt on that, lets look at other metrics that are important like stablecoins:</p>\n\n<p>Their native algorithmic stablecoin they created is called &quot;Djed&quot;, how&#39;s that doing?</p>\n\n<p>Well its marketcap rank is 2,275 and its total marketcap is $3.9 million: <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins\">https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins</a></p>\n\n<p>For context Tether USD is $129 billion, so a mere 33,076x bigger than DJED.</p>\n\n<p>So its safe to say noone uses that either.</p>\n\n<p>And then there&#39;s the &quot;questionable&quot; marketing from the Cardano ecosystem, always &quot;promising&quot; these &quot;obscure/nebulous&quot; things to get people hyped:</p>\n\n<p>Charles Hoskinson saying \u201cRogan after Goguen\u201d back in 2021, Goguen was their update set to launch in Q2 2021 but &quot;Rogan&quot; never happened: <a href=\"https://x.com/equalscash/status/1771275113029120192\">https://x.com/equalscash/status/1771275113029120192</a></p>\n\n<p>Charles now &quot;insinuating&quot; he&#39;s going to work with the Trump admin next year: <a href=\"https://x.com/AltcoinGordon/status/1855492949863207193\">https://x.com/AltcoinGordon/status/1855492949863207193</a></p>\n\n<p>Charles saying he signed an NDA with Spacex: <a href=\"https://x.com/CARDAN0ADA/status/1857474096805638483\">https://x.com/CARDAN0ADA/status/1857474096805638483</a></p>\n\n<p>He then clarifies in another video and says he hopes to reveal details in 4-8 weeks but &quot;we&#39;ll see&quot;: <a href=\"https://x.com/angrycryptoshow/status/1858970634258124923\">https://x.com/angrycryptoshow/status/1858970634258124923</a></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile Elon has repeatedly confirmed he will not endorse any specific projects, although he is &quot;supportive&quot; of crypto as a whole: <a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1787354882791399512\">https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1787354882791399512</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1848100967272665154\">https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1848100967272665154</a></p>\n\n<p>Charles has also said that he believes bitcoin is &quot;like a religion, not a real ecosystem&quot;, that &quot;we dont really need it&quot;, and that he sees Cardano surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum in the future.</p>\n\n<p>All of these things can appear as just innocent fluff or hype individually, but as a whole paint a much more concerning picture of the sort of &quot;marketing&quot; in the Cardano ecosystem, even from the top.</p>\n\n<p>And the culmination of all of this ultimately is the &quot;PSYOP&quot;:</p>\n\n<p>That while Ethereum has near all time high activity, tvl, inflows, marketshare, devs, dapps, stablecoins, it is pronounced by the popular narrative as &quot;dead&quot;</p>\n\n<p>While other chains who have foundations built on &quot;memecoin casino mirages&quot; and &quot;fleeting promises&quot; are propped up by the narrative as &quot;the future&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s my TL:DR that essentially says as much:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/etheraider/status/1859089080815849954\">https://x.com/etheraider/status/1859089080815849954</a></p>\n\n<p>And to further clarify a &quot;Psyop&quot; doesnt have to be some grand conspiracy, there just have to be enough incentives in place and the wheels turn themselves.</p>\n\n<p>I started this post with a point about Bitcoin, and so I&#39;ll end it that way.</p>\n\n<p>Histocally in the stock market almost all stocks that hit $90 will hit $100. In the same vein, as soon as Bitcoin hit $90k the market psychologically built in the expectation that it would hit $100k. $100k is the largest historical and psychological barrier we will have seen to date with BTC, so until that moment arrives all eyes are on $BTC.</p>\n\n<p>However once BTC hits 100k, the risk reward perception completely changes, the adjusted risk/reward for Bitcoin to 2x to 200k vs drop 50% to 50k becomes much more &quot;even&quot; and the exuberance for bitcoin has a very good chance of &quot;tapering off&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And everytime bitcoin has tapered off in a bull, guess what happens? Eth skyrockets. But don&#39;t take my word for it, go check the charts going back multiple cycles.</p>\n\n<p>Its always darkest before the dawn, the facemelting is only facemelting because it rips up suddenly when people least expect it, AKA when the FUD is at its peak.</p>\n\n<p>Do with this what you will, believe it or not, makes no difference to me, but just know the narrative is slowly changing.</p>\n\n<p>Slowly, then all at once: <a

This is how they get unsuspecting people for a few extra hundred $ in fees.\n\nCoinbase Example: As a long time hodler you have zero 30 day trading volume, and ETH finally pumps so you have a limit order of 10 ETH set at 10K, so $100,000 worth of volume. **Many people incorrectly assume that the fee charged will automatically scale with the size of their order.** So they think that when their 100K limit order executes, they will pay 0.60% on the first 1K, 0.35% on the next 9K, then 0.25% on the next 40K etc... (kinda like how US federal taxes are calculated progressively as you go up the income bracket)\n\n**THAT IS WRONG.** If you have 0 30-day trading volume, and you execute a 100K order in one go, **you will be charged the 0.6% ON THE ENTIRE 100K ORDER. So you end up paying $600 in fees for your limit sell order of 10 ETH at 10K.**\n\nKraken Example: Same situation as above. Zero 30 day trailing volume... sell 10 ETH at 10K in a limit order, you will pay 0.25% on the entire 100K, so you pay $250 in fees.\n\nResult = You save $350 just by selling on Kraken instead of Coinbase.\n\nNow if you actually want to take advantage of the lower trading fees shown in the tables above, you have to split your order into several smaller orders. Now here's the kicker for those that would actually go out of their way to do that. **Coinbase says it takes up to an hour for the fee tier to update after each trade you make**. **Earlier this year I made several trades and can confirm it took them about 30 minutes to update my fee tier after each trade.**\n\nSo take the previous example of our limit order of 10 ETH at 10K on Coinbase, if we wanted to split our order up to minimize the amount of fees paid, this is what we'd have to do.\n\n1. Sell 0.1 ETH at $10,000 ($1,000 volume) so that takes up the \"0.60%\" fee. We pay $6 here.\n2. WAIT ANOTHER 30-60 MINUTES to update to the second tier.\n3. Sell 1 ETH at $10,000 (10K volume), and that takes up the \"0.35%\" fee. You pay $35 here.\n4. WAIT ANOTHER 30-60 MINUTES to update to the third tier.\n5. Sell 4 ETH at $10,000 (40K volume, but cumulative at $51,010 volume now), so that takes up the \"0.25%\" fee. We pay $100 here.\n6. Wait more...\n7. Sell remaining 4.9 ETH at $10,000 (49K volume). Since we are now over 50K but under 500K volume that gets charged 0.15%. Which is $73.15.\n\nAdd that up you get = 6+35+100+73.15 = $214.15 in fees for selling 10 ETH at $10,000 over a span of 3-4 hours (maybe price wildly fluctuates over that time) waiting for CB to update your fee tier. Or if you didn't want to split your order up and wait hours, then you do it all in a single order and pay $600...\n\nNow if you're willing to use Kraken, the good news is that they update the fee tiers almost instantaneously after each trade (since Kraken can do update instantly there's no reason CB can't, I believe they're just greedy and set the delay intentionally). So you can split your 10 ETH order up into several smaller orders and execute them all within the span of a few minutes and get the lowest fee tier. If you're too lazy to do that, then at least doing it in one order will only cost you $250 on Kraken vs $600 on Coinbase.\n\nDO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PLAN AHEAD SO YOU DON'T THROW HUNDREDS (MAYBE THOUSANDS FOR THE WHALES HERE) OF $$$ INTO THE TRASH FOR NO REASON.
