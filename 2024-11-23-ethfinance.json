Everyone online was buzzing about some 10-year-old kid making a fortune, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if there was something I was missing. So, fueled by curiosity and a touch of liquid courage, I downloaded the Phantom wallet app.\n\nAs soon as I opened the App Store, I realized just how big this hype was. Phantom was the most downloaded utility app in the US and ranked third in Switzerland. It wasn\u2019t just hype. It was everywhere. Determined to do my research, I hopped onto YouTube and stumbled upon some wannabe trader sitting in a futuristic chair, a big mic in front of him and a meme coin chart behind him.\n\nThe guy was hyped, to say the least. He was live-streaming not just on YouTube, where about 200 people were watching, but also on TikTok, where he claimed more than 2000 people were tuned in. It seemed like a spectacle. I wasn\u2019t sure if this guy or one of his buddies had created the coin he was hyping, but I started by just observing.\n\nAs I watched, the market cap of this meme coin skyrocketed - from $100k to $1M, then $2M, $3M, and all the way to $5M. He swore he was holding until it hit $10M. And then, just like that, it crashed, plummeting back to its starting point. I managed to get in and out just in time. My two-beer logic had served me well. This was gambling money, after all, and I knew what I was getting into. But wow, what a  ride.\n\nNow, about the Phantom wallet. At first, the UX seemed pretty smooth, but things started to fall apart when I tried swapping my coins. Transactions kept failing, likely also due to my slippage settings. I had to manually increase the slippage to make swaps work, which eventually helped, but even then, many of my transactions failed. Not the smooth experience you\u2019d hope for, especially when dealing with fast-moving coins in a hype-filled market. Failed transactions, though, seem to be a feature of Solana. If you read \u201cSolana\u201d backward, it tells you everything. \n\nThe real kicker? There\u2019s no option to place limit orders directly in the app. Apparently, you can do this by opening the Jupiter app inside the Phantom browser, connecting your wallet, and setting a limit there. But let\u2019s be real - most retail users probably don\u2019t know about this and end up losing even more money.\n\nThe sad truth is that scammers like this TikTok trader aren\u2019t helping the crypto industry at all. Their pump-and-dump schemes feed on greed and ignorance, damaging trust in the space as a whole. Platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok should take responsibility and block these people. They\u2019re not traders, they\u2019re hustlers.\n\nIn previous market cycles, I had hoped that the bear markets would wash out these toxic projects and the grifters behind them. But greed seems to be a constant in human nature, and here they are again. That said, I remain hopeful that eventually, these schemes and the people running them will vanish. Who knows, maybe this time will be different\u2026\n\nAfter converting my meme coins back into ETH, I deleted the Phantom app. The experience was chaotic but enlightening. If anything, it solidified my belief that Ethereum is the future, not these pump-and-dump shitcoin factories masquerading as alternative blockchains.\n\nAt least now I know firsthand what the hype is all about and I\u2019m happy to leave it behind.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Last night after two beers, I decided it was time to see what all the fuss was about with these Solana meme coins.

I hodled through the DAO hack despair and traded my fair share of shitcoins on this exciting new decentralized platform called Etherdelta. We have come a long way since then with a lot of ups and downs along the way. A couple things that may be helpful for some this cycle:\n\n\\- Always zoom out. The more we obsess about price, the more misaligned our timeline becomes. The market is doing what it has done every single eth cycle to date but yet sentiment has been very pessimistic. \n\n\\- Keep it simple. Price obsession causes creates a disconnect between timelines and leads to chronic overthinking. The best trades/investments are usually the simplest. IE the dislocation you have seen with ETH's price and your thesis = buying opportunity, not complaining opportunity. Keep your strategies simple. Less is usually more. Trading/investing is very counterintuitive to most other things in life. We are trained to work the hardest/longest hours to reap the ultimate prize in most endeavors.

Develop a sound execution plan with 100% certainty that your human brain will somewhat cave to the widespread euphoria & despair moments in the market cycles. With this knowledge and acceptance of your psychological limitations, you will execute your plan developed in times of ration. After despair and euphoria cycles resolve, as they always do, both your pnl and your wellbeing will be grateful you acted according to plan and with ration. Now everyone's plan is different. Just make sure it lines up with your actual thesis/process. For some, that may be to simply hodl forever. For others, that may be a swing trade to a cycle high. And so on. There is no one size fits all. That leads me to my next reminder.\n\n\\- Don't compare yourself to others. There will always be someone better off and always be a better performing asset.
