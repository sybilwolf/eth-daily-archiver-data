As far as I see the AgentChud tried to start a discussion in the cowswap discord, but as soon as he was challenged by some of the mods to bring more evidence for his claims, he said he will involve Zach (ZachXBT?) and shortly after left the discussion. Does not seem to me that he has solid evidence about the scope and size of the pseudo sandwiching. This does not mean it is not happening, it just means that it most probably is much more difficult to prove and estimate if it is a problem for most users or just for a certain subset of users.</p>\n\n<p>According to cowswap, they found some places where information could be leaked, but according to them it is not the place which was suggested by the OG tweet thread.  I hope there will be some analysis in the coming weeks/months about this as it definitely is an interesting topic.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-26 01:19:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lz1tbwi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gzc4yp","parent_id":"t1_lyzkfvh","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"I'm happy to stay on rollups with super low slippage.

But perhaps a token that aggregates data from L1 and L2\u2014rollups, validiums, or anything that brings economic value to Ethereum\u2014using real-time data from oracles could effectively represent the entire Ethereum ecosystem&#39;s economic activity in a single token. I guess this would be an index token pegged to the combined L1 and L2 economic activity, which can provide a more accurate comparison against monolithic blockchains to address the fragmentation FUD. The downside would be if such a token were successful, it might reduce capital flowing directly into individual projects within the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-25 15:16:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lyzjh5b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gzc4yp","parent_id":"t3_1gzc4yp","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/ETHdude8686","body":"Someone really not want ETH to go up","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Someone really not want ETH to go up</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-25 11:22:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lyyavt3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gzc4yp","parent_id":"t3_1gzc4yp","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Sparta89","body":"Many big players are still accumulating ETH","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Many big players are still accumulating ETH</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-25 11:50:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lyyge9e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gzc4yp","parent_id":"t1_lyyavt3","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/forbothofus","body":"They love to sell it!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>They love to sell it!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-25 11:53:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lyygxfj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gzc4yp","parent_id":"t1_lyyavt3","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[(0.034719) $3,425.47 - \ud83d\udcaa RatioGang \ud83d\udcc8 - The ETH / BTC Ratio Tracker](https://ratiogang.com/)\n\n  \nit's a long road to the eth rally.
