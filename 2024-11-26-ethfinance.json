The first was the split from ethtrader, and the second was the launch of the EVMavericks. \n\nWhether good or bad, both of these have resulted in fractures that we may not  have fully healed from. The split from ethrader got us away from instant-gratification payments, and the emergence of EVMavericks created a sub-community within our ranks that has effectively been banned from being discussed here. \n\nI see the long term impact of the emergence and separation of EVMavericks as a detriment to our community (even though it's a net positive to Ethereum), but I also see why it happened. The NFT launch was fun, but it also came with a LOT of bitterness and hard feelings that probably still haven't been resolved. But the outflow is that the EVMavericks operate on discord in quiet parallel to the daily conversations here. In many ways, I really feel like that's okay.\n\nThe real consequence is that our \"doers\" are now \"doing\" on a tangential platform. That can be okay, as long as we recognize it, I think the work of the EVMavericks is great, and I sincerely hope they continue pushing in every direction.\n\nBUT, and here's the big one - it has left ethfinance without a call to action. Our action is happening elsewhere. This may explain much of the activity drain here: We've lost a call to action.

Do it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I want to become aware of a thing and observe it with you.</p>\n\n<p>There have been about two earthquake-level events in this community. The first was the split from ethtrader, and the second was the launch of the EVMavericks. </p>\n\n<p>Whether good or bad, both of these have resulted in fractures that we may not  have fully healed from. The split from ethrader got us away from instant-gratification payments, and the emergence of EVMavericks created a sub-community within our ranks that has effectively been banned from being discussed here. </p>\n\n<p>I see the long term impact of the emergence and separation of EVMavericks as a detriment to our community (even though it&#39;s a net positive to Ethereum), but I also see why it happened. The NFT launch was fun, but it also came with a LOT of bitterness and hard feelings that probably still haven&#39;t been resolved. But the outflow is that the EVMavericks operate on discord in quiet parallel to the daily conversations here. In many ways, I really feel like that&#39;s okay.</p>\n\n<p>The real consequence is that our &quot;doers&quot; are now &quot;doing&quot; on a tangential platform. That can be okay, as long as we recognize it, I think the work of the EVMavericks is great, and I sincerely hope they continue pushing in every direction.</p>\n\n<p>BUT, and here&#39;s the big one - it has left ethfinance without a call to action. Our action is happening elsewhere. This may explain much of the activity drain here: We&#39;ve lost a call to action. We NEED a shared goal to work toward, to build our community and give meaning to our toil. </p>\n\n<p>So here&#39;s your challenge: Generate that shared work here. Think about it. Share it. Start it.
