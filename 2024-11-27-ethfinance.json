This is only something which will happen if the community thinks it&#39;s in their best interest. Any binding poll will likely need a supermajority. a 55/45 split for example in favour of migrating would likely see us staying here. Again, this is also assuming we can make a deal with the <a href=\"/r/Ethereum\">r/Ethereum</a> mods that works for us which is yet to be seen.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-27 17:12:43","distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"id":"lzc4now","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1h0xkvx","parent_id":"t1_lzc40nf","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/mild-blue-yonder","body":"I actually think if you\u2019re gonna do it, announce and do it like the ethtrader/ethfinance split.
