The people from the tax office I had on the phone were surprisingly knowledgeable about crypto stuff. Obviously not like many of us here, but still they knew the basics. And this year I had some questions how to exactly declare a CDP, they more or less told me the easier for both of us the better as long as total wealth is calculated properly. I also do not need to declare every trade I do. They are only interested about end of year net holdings. I guess if things do not add up they would get supsicious. \n\nThe federal tax administration even has a short working paper they update every few years which clarifies most cases on how to handle various crypto holdings/incomes (in german): https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/de/home/direkte-bundessteuer/fachinformationen-dbst/kryptowaehrungen.html\n\nAbout the specific points in the link linked in another post here:\n\nYes staking income is part of your normal income and needs to be taxed accordingly. If you use things like rETH or other non rebasing LSTs in my current understanding they do not fall under income taxes.\n\nAirdrops are part of your income. I declared some of the weirdest airdrops and they just nodded. \n\nThere is a wealth tax in Switzerland, not only for crypto, but for all your possessions. The rate depends on the region/village you live in. I was surprised to hear that wealth taxes are not something every country has. Wealth tax depends on your absolute wealth the more you have, the more you pay. Below a certain limit it is 0%. If you have 1 million CHF in wealth, you pay somewhere between 0.1% and 0.4% in wealth tax (CHF 1000 - 4000). This is in the range what  an ETF costs annually (TER, total expense ratio). There are also regions where it is lower. If you have 10 million the wealth tax is in the range of 0.2%-0.6%. Not a strong increase in that wealth range. Interestingly, wealth tax only exists on the village/regional level the federal level (country) does not tax your wealth.\n\nTrading gains are not taxed, but it could be that if you trade a lot they look at this being your job and then gains are taxed as income. The rules there are a bit murky, but I have never heard of anyone falling in this category by just normal degening. As far as I understand you have to tick quite a few boxes such that this applies to you. If you are a heavy options trader, your ~~gains are regularly~~ trading volume is more than 5 times what wealth you had at the beginning of the year and trading is your main income you might fall under this, but as said I never heard of this happening to anyone. My impression is currently that the various tax offices in Switzerland are rather reasonable about this.\n\nOverall I think Switzerland is a pretty good place tax wise. No reason for me to leave here because of that. In the last few months I rather think about ways to legally pay more taxes, because I have the feeling I pay too little for what I get back in general quality of life here. Maybe I will have to contact a tax accountant in the coming years to ask about legal ways to pay more taxes. Not sure if a normal tax accountant knows about legal ways to pay more... But it also has to be clear that cost of living is rather high here. If you move here for tax reasons only you might save a lot on the tax side, but you easily spend the saved money on rent and general expenses.\n\nEDIT: I read a bit about wealth tax around the world. Really seems like Switzerland is one of the few countries which has that. I am honestly a bit surprised about this as this does not fit with the general image of it being a tax haven. Sure, foreign nationals parking their money in Switzerland do not have to pay that and the wealth tax for residents is on the lower side compared to the few other countries which have one, but still it is not 0%.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have no idea how Switzerland really compares with other countries tax wise. In my experience they are quite easy going with crypto and taxes. I get a letter from my tax office every year to clarify some things. I then call them and we can clear things up quite easily and I normally have to write them the additional info by email. I do all my taxes myself and does not take more than a few hours to do. The most time is spent on adding up all the different positions, LPs, CDPs over all my accounts on various rollups.
