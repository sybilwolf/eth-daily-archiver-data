It sounds pretty similar to what GnosisVPN, developed by HOPR, is set out to do.\n\nOverall what I take home from this is that a normal VPN is not a very good tool to actually hide your tracks (Not really surprising) and that we may have to use decentralized VPNs which actually deliver on that promise. Not sure if I would trust NymVPN to hide my plans for overthrowing a government after this presentation, but it is definitely a tool I will look at.

BTC and ETH pumped hard, then sold off as people moved profits down to SOL. That moving money kicks off the &quot;hot ball of money&quot; that brought retail in, growing in the pump.fun meme coins until it hits mainstream spillover. This week is clearly unsustainable, not based on reality, and will come crashing back to earth. </p>\n\n<p>But the macro fundamentals are still intact for BTC and ETH to go on their 4 year cycle run, in fact they&#39;re looking better than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>Will the mini ETF pump cycle ruin the 4 year cycle?
