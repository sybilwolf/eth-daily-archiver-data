Onchain ETH can be very valuable, so it only makes sense to buy the eth etf if you&#39;re an etf native</p>\n\n<p>2) we&#39;re not coming out of a ZIRP era in the face of exploding inflation. that migth come, but interest rates are already very high, so we likely don&#39;t have that pain to go through. </p>\n\n<p>3) we wont have ftx to market dump eth to prop up their vaporware. btc still has a gigantic MSTR overhang with a possible cascade (MSTR has to sell btc to pay debt, which lowers the value of its remaiing btc, so it has to sell more, etc), but eth doesnt have that risk. the risk there is just that people will sell eth because of its beta. eth tails are much less scary</p>\n\n<p>on the upside?</p>\n\n<p>ETH is currently fudded to hell by VCs running the sol/btc barbell, which explicitly includes shorting ETH by some, notably salami.
