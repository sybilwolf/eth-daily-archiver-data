This would make sure we wouldn't have any further dependency on Infura and other centralizing forces.\n\n> 2 - Enshrine the snarkification of ethereum within itself.\n\nWTF is that?\n\nThere will be a zk EVM pre-compile, where if you want to launch a zkrollup, you'll only need a single line of code, and you won't need to worry about bugs, nor \ngovernance to enact changes whenever the EVM changes (it'd be reflected immediately on the pre-compile after any changes to the EVM).\n\nPreviously, we had execution sharding which would be limited to 64(or up to 1024?) shards, and each shard would have its own state and grow independently, asynchronously.\n\nNow there will be **synchronous programmable execution sharding**. These programs can deploy as many EVMs as they want, which would further increase the horizontal scaling of L1. These shards can also increase gas limit arbitrarily high, bc validators that verify state transition functions within the EVM only need to verify the snark proofs. \n \nSynchronous programmable execution sharding allows Ethereum to be maximally simple and provide building blocks that people can build around however they like, commoditizing VM, which allows L2s to have custom sequencers, gov and fee tokens, and any other infrastructure that they might want to experiment with. \n\n\nNow is the part I didn't really fully grasp, Justin mentions we can go even further:\nWe can boost programmability by not enshrining EVM itself, but enshrine a zkEVM underneath it. Instead of a zkEVM pre-compile, we have zk Risk-V pre-compile. The EVM would be a Risk-V program/bytecode, which is interpreted in real time by the native VM of the Risk-V.\n\nHe also expands on the other items that will be treated under the Beam Chain, but which might be well known to ethfinance already:\n\n**Preconfirmations**\n\n>Can be proportionally as low as ping times, would lead to better UX and become better than sqlana's, while keeping decentralization on Ethereum, and can be divided into:\n\n>>1. execution preconfirmations: you know how your tx will execute: eg. you'd know exact uniswap trade price and fees you'll pay\n>>2. inclusion preconfirmations: you only know it'll be included, but you don't know how\n\n>On L1, the best we can do is the weaker type **b**, but we expect most users to move to L2 so they'll enjoy the type **a** instead.\n\n\nRegarding **slot times**:\n\n>12s slot times was picked as a conservative measure as a trade-off to keep the values of Ethereum, which aims to be extremely secure, credibly neutral and robust. After further optimization, we can comfortably reduce slot times to 4s, which is good enough from a UX perspective while safely maintaining the process for a round of attestations (where a subset of validators make signatures, gossip and aggregate it to be included in the chain). \n\n>>Which trade-off? \n\n>>1. Have solo stakers with high latency home internet connections worldwide\n>>2. Have as many validators and economic security as possible per slot(see attestations \nfor them all)\n\n\nWith **attester proposer separation**, we can:\n \n>1. remove timing games as a concern to validators, \n>2. remove MEV spikes due to volatility, \n>3. remove worries about sophistication by [having to deposit collateral with preconfirmations](https://ethresear.ch/t/credibly-neutral-preconfirmation-collateral-the-preconfirmation-registry/19634)\n\n> All of these combined can make validators unsophisticated, which would allow the end game of being able to validate from a smartwatch  \n\n\nConcerns were raised regarding **block building centralization** (could newly announced buildernet be part of the solution(?))\n\n>However, validators are still responsible for the most critical part of block building: which is to include tx on the chain and be censorship resistance, which would be solved with **FOCIL**, where every single slot you have 16 validators that  builds tx they've seen, these lists are aggregated into a masterlist, and that is the starting \npoint for builders to build the block. Builders can adjust the list in 2 ways: \n>>1. reorder transactions\n>>2. insert transaction here and there to front run and back run\n\n>FOCIL still leads to a healthy and decentralized block building from an inclusion standpoint, and only the final piece by builders would be centralized.\n\nBonus is that **DA has network effects** instead of becoming commoditized:\n>1. shared security: undeniably secure money legos that others want to compose with leads to ethereum DA.\n>2. syncronous composability: shares sequencer, if you use altDA, another sequencer will play key role to produce and settle those tx, breaking syncronous composability.\n>3. to make use of the enshrined zk EVM pre compile, data needs to be available and published on Ethereum blobs.

Yes that is very much possible that the beam chain can do that. I looked at it from a pure technical point of view and I am definitely blind on my social layer eye. Maybe it makes sense to create a separate package to generate hype around it instead of incremental improvements. On the other hand, bringing smaller validators, faster slot times, snarkification will be exciting improvements in themself which each will improve how we interact with the chain and therefore they themselves can generate enough hype for the social layer to rally behind. Bringing them in one big package later on might dilute the buzz they each can generate.\n\nAbout the drawbacks of the beam chain. I do not think there are fundamental drawbacks which are a dealbreaker. One can package up these items and give the wrapped package a new name. No problem in that. I look at it from the other side: Does the Beam chain package have fundamental advantages? I do not see any. Sure, marketing hype could be good, sure new teams could start developing clients, but hey these teams could also start with a new client now, see for example what Grandine does. Some smaller drawbacks of the beam chain approach I see are that the beam chain development will add another development and improvements channel along the already existing ones (ACDE, ACDC, Implementers calls and more). This creates additional overhead. One of the advantages Justins mentions is said to be that they can develop faster if they do the beam chain in parallel. But to be honest, Ethereum development has become very parallelized in the last few years with separating execution and consensus and the more recent item focussed calls, like for the verkle tree implementation, easily allow for parallel development in the current framework. No reason to add an additional decision channel.\n\nAnd just to be clear this is just my opinion as a partially informed outsider. Justin Drake is an amazing researcher and a delight to listen to.
