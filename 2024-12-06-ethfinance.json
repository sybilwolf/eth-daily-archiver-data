Seen that SNARK proofs are smaller in size, this could lead to further gains in scalability by being able to more cheaply post data to L1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Overall, as you mentioned, this is a great talk for anyone just starting to explore Ethereum more deeply and who might be eager to understand the jargon that fills the ecosystem.. Honestly, it&#39;s the perfect gateway to dive headfirst into the endless possibilities and uncover the deeper layers of this exciting world which is Ethereum.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-12-06

This will only get easier as its security budget falls.\n\n####**How to 51% attack Bitcoin with low risk and still make a good profit**\n\nAttackers can make lots of profit during a 51% attack on PoW while still producing perfectly-valid blocks that follow Bitcoin protocol. Many in the Bitcoin community would begrudgingly accept the attacker's blocks, especially if the attacks follow protocol and only cause limited damage for end users.\n\n(Many of these ideas were mentioned by [Justin Drake in the \"Optimizing a 51% Attack\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h063gx/bitcoin_seriously_attacked_within_next_34_years/lz1nexb/) talk on YouTube. A great video to watch.)\n\n**List of profitable attack strategies**\n\n* **Produce empty blocks**: A decade ago, empty block were fairly common just because it was faster to produce them than waiting for a full block. An attacker could produce empty blocks. This would slow down throughput, cause chaos, and cause transaction prices to rise considerably. The Bitcoin community has always allowed empty or partially-filled blocks.\n* **Only allow high-fee transactions**: Censorship attacks like this lead to a transaction supply-squeeze, and desperate users like exchanges will be forced to submit extremely-high priority fees. Block producers have done this in the past, but never as a prolonged full-scale attack. The Bitcoin community has always allowed miners to selectively pick transactions from the mempool.\n* **Cornering the market**: An attacker can keep out other miners. They can reorg the network whenever another miner gets a block in. Eventually, honest miners will give up because they can't mine profitably against a 51%-attacker, and the attacker will have cornered the entire block-production market.\n* **Spawn-camping**: After cornering the market, the 51% attacker can reduce its hash rate, lowering its own costs, and make even more profit. Whenever an honest miner rejoins, the attacker can power up its mining rigs again and reorg the network, forcing the honest miner to give up again.\n* **Short Bitcoin and cause chaos**: Miners don't need to hold BTC. It's not Proof of Stake. They can short Bitcoin or Bitcoin mining company stocks. They can cause chaos with reorgs, making a huge amount of profit. (Among all the attacks listed here, this is probably the only one that's illegal in some countries due to manipulating the stock market.)\n* **Selfish mining (e.g. withholding attack)**: An attacker can withhold broadcasting their attack until they have secretly produced many blocks. This makes it impossible to detect a reorg until after it happens. This also improves the efficiently of mining attacks by 10-20% so that an attacker can execute short 51% attacks with only 30% of the total hash.\n* **Double-spend on wrapped Bitcoin contracts**: Most Bitcoin nodes will not allow double-spends because they will choose to stop following Bitcoin protocol when anomalies are detected. However, wrapped Bitcoin contracts are usually programmatic and follow Bitcoin protocols. Many will allow for double-spends and can be targeted by 51% attackers.\n* **Create Fear**: The attacker doesn't even have to do anything bad. Simply by proving that they have over 51% of the mining hash rate is enough to make everyone abandon Bitcoin out of fear that the attacker could double-spend at any time and crash the market.\n* **Opportunistic attacks**: Unlike honest miners, attackers can join and leave opportunistically. They don't need to constantly mine to keep the network safe. They can attack, cause chaos, and leave for weeks. And then they can re-attack again at any time. This instability causes chaos for the market and for honest miners.\n* **Timing attacks**: Time the attack when hash rate is lower, like during a bear market or when energy prices are high. This reduces the cost of attack.\n\n**After-effects of an attack**\n\nAs honest miners give up and sell their mining rigs, the cost of attacking the PoW blockchain will continue to decrease. Crypto doesn't have anti-trust regulations, so there's no regulator that can prevent a miner from cornering the block production market. Bitcoin nodes could try to hard-fork the network, but the attackers will just switch to the fork and continue attacking.\n\nA large portion of Bitcoin investors will likely drop Bitcoin and switch to more secure blockchains that are much more resistant to 51% attacks.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Bitcoin&#39;s currently valued at $2T, but it still only costs 0.5-1% of the mcap ($10B-15B) in mining capex to 51% attack it.

(Among all the attacks listed here, this is probably the only one that&#39;s illegal in some countries due to manipulating the stock market.)</li>\n<li><strong>Selfish mining (e.g. withholding attack)</strong>: An attacker can withhold broadcasting their attack until they have secretly produced many blocks. This makes it impossible to detect a reorg until after it happens. This also improves the efficiently of mining attacks by 10-20% so that an attacker can execute short 51% attacks with only 30% of the total hash.</li>\n<li><strong>Double-spend on wrapped Bitcoin contracts</strong>: Most Bitcoin nodes will not allow double-spends because they will choose to stop following Bitcoin protocol when anomalies are detected. However, wrapped Bitcoin contracts are usually programmatic and follow Bitcoin protocols. Many will allow for double-spends and can be targeted by 51% attackers.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Fear</strong>: The attacker doesn&#39;t even have to do anything bad. Simply by proving that they have over 51% of the mining hash rate is enough to make everyone abandon Bitcoin out of fear that the attacker could double-spend at any time and crash the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Opportunistic attacks</strong>: Unlike honest miners, attackers can join and leave opportunistically. They don&#39;t need to constantly mine to keep the network safe. They can attack, cause chaos, and leave for weeks. And then they can re-attack again at any time. This instability causes chaos for the market and for honest miners.</li>\n<li><strong>Timing attacks</strong>: Time the attack when hash rate is lower, like during a bear market or when energy prices are high. This reduces the cost of attack.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>After-effects of an attack</strong></p>\n\n<p>As honest miners give up and sell their mining rigs, the cost of attacking the PoW blockchain will continue to decrease. Crypto doesn&#39;t have anti-trust regulations, so there&#39;s no regulator that can prevent a miner from cornering the block production market. Bitcoin nodes could try to hard-fork the network, but the attackers will just switch to the fork and continue attacking.</p>\n\n<p>A large portion of Bitcoin investors will likely drop Bitcoin and switch to more secure blockchains that are much more resistant to 51% attacks.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-12-06 01:45:39","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-12-06 02:01:50","id":"m0oo5q3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1h7upd0","parent_id":"t3_1h7upd0","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/epic_trader","body":"I feel like the most obvious and likely attack, which also is far cheaper than the usual estimates, is for the 2 largest mining pools collude to attack the network.
