Once that precedent became set everyone copycatted that answer to raise stupid amounts of money in what was clearly one of the most exciting periods to invest I've ever experienced. Obviously most tokens shouldn't be \"utility tokens\" and this led to terrible UX for a lot of projects but if you're wondering why this terrible UX caught on, avoiding securities laws is the answer. Thanks Gary!\n\nThen the SEC started suing US companies that tried this so the trend dried up, it wasn't proven illegal mind you, the SEC just created enough regulatory uncertainty and threat so no one wanted to try it just to be the standard bearer in a 4 year lawsuit (thanks Ripple!). Naturally all the ETH that was given to these projects was then cashed out to fund the project or just to grift and we were left holding the bag on a historically awful drawdown of ETH from $1400 to $80.

I digress though.\n\nA few years later, necessity remains the mother of invention and the need was still there to offer crowd funding so the ecosystem thought up a new mechanism for this. Rather than *selling* tokens, projects would just give tokens away in a massive inflationary bonanza. They would not only give tokens away to people just escrowing some ETH in a pool, they would give *a lot* of tokens away for people to LP their new token so there was liquidity to sell into. It's probably worth reminding you at this point that [no one is giving tokens away](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole-explorers-guide/#no-one-is-giving-away-free-crypto). This created liquidity pools that the token originator could then dump onto to raise money for their project. Also it was very fun to dump some ETH in YFI or YAM Pool-0s and see 1000% APR numbers stream at you in real-time. We were crazy then, the bear market does weird things to you, you just had to be there for it to make sense.\n\nHow did this evade securities laws? Well, the token originator never let people directly invest in the project. All money raised by the project was through secondary sales on Dexs. Whomever bought the tokens didn't know they were buying it from the project so there was no reasonable expectation that the sale was an investment in the project. Genius! Thank you Ripple for setting that precedent. Naturally all of the tokens powering themselves using this inflationary model debased themselves down like 99% from the top, investors got burned as devaluation of the token value was even higher than the ridiculous APR these pools promised, and eventually everyone wizened up to the fact that [inflation is not profit](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole-explorers-guide/#inflation-is-not-profit) so the trend dried up.\n\nSo, a few years pass and once again the demand for crowd funding was never going to go away and so the ecosystem thought up an even stupider way of accomplishing this.

This time though they were going to airdrop it rather than make you farm it. No inflation, so people weren't scared of it but nonetheless retail were going to get dumped on by VCs. The VCs would recoup more than their initial investment even if the project then died at this stage so everyone was happy except some people who bought YT tokens (you degens!) or bought the token that VCs then dumped on. Most of these projects were so early stage they barely had a functioning product (looking at you Eigen) or were things like LRTs where there isn't even a plan to build a product.\n\nAnd so what we learn from all of this is that there is a demand for crowd funding and that it isn't going away no matter what the SEC wants. Projects are going to kickstart, gofundme, launch memecoins, brazenly violate SEC desires but base their company outside US legal reach, etc and people are going to invest in those projects no matter how scammy the fundraising mechanism is because that is just human nature and the technology fundamentally enables it in an unstoppable way.

I feel pretty good moving ahead with the 6/9 blob increase. I really hope, now that we have better systems in place for monitoring available bandwidth, that we continue to keep an eye on those metrics. Does the move to 6/9 play out as expected? Does available bandwidth decrease by the expected amounts? We'll be looking at more changes to the blob count in the future, so we need to get a good understanding of the actual effect this change has.\n\nI can understand the reasoning for increasing the gas limit, particularly contingent on inclusion of 7623. And if we've decided that there is bandwidth to spare, it makes sense that some of that should go to the L1 rather than all being allocated to blobs.\n\nI feel less certain about the effect it will have on home staking operations. Presumably bandwidth is the limiting factor for most people, and from that perspective increasing (even doubling) block size isn't too impactful on bandwidth usage compared to adding on a bunch more blobs.\n\nBut increased block size has potential effects beyond just bandwidth. CPU load, SSD speed, and SSD space (from increased state growth) could all be limiting factors for some people's setups (would there be an effect on RAM too--I'm not sure). How much \"overhead\" do home stakers have on each of these metrics before they'd be forced to upgrade? Fortunately these are easier upgrades to make, whereas my upload speed is heavily throttled and I'm already paying for the best Internet plan I can buy. There's the can of worms about what the cost to operate a validator *should* be, but assuming we could all agree on that, it still takes work to figure out the correlation between block size and cost.\n\nDo we have data on this? For a X% increase in average block size, is there an effect on block import time in a way that could effect attestation effectiveness? Which CPUs and SSDs become non-viable and how does this affect the minimum cost to run a validator? Or maybe the answer is that bandwidth is the only limiting factor and there are zero other problems; that would be great! But do we know that's the case?\n\nI'm happy to support a blob increase with the data now to support it.

We&#39;ll be looking at more changes to the blob count in the future, so we need to get a good understanding of the actual effect this change has.</p>\n\n<p>I can understand the reasoning for increasing the gas limit, particularly contingent on inclusion of 7623. And if we&#39;ve decided that there is bandwidth to spare, it makes sense that some of that should go to the L1 rather than all being allocated to blobs.</p>\n\n<p>I feel less certain about the effect it will have on home staking operations. Presumably bandwidth is the limiting factor for most people, and from that perspective increasing (even doubling) block size isn&#39;t too impactful on bandwidth usage compared to adding on a bunch more blobs.</p>\n\n<p>But increased block size has potential effects beyond just bandwidth. CPU load, SSD speed, and SSD space (from increased state growth) could all be limiting factors for some people&#39;s setups (would there be an effect on RAM too--I&#39;m not sure). How much &quot;overhead&quot; do home stakers have on each of these metrics before they&#39;d be forced to upgrade? Fortunately these are easier upgrades to make, whereas my upload speed is heavily throttled and I&#39;m already paying for the best Internet plan I can buy. There&#39;s the can of worms about what the cost to operate a validator <em>should</em> be, but assuming we could all agree on that, it still takes work to figure out the correlation between block size and cost.</p>\n\n<p>Do we have data on this? For a X% increase in average block size, is there an effect on block import time in a way that could effect attestation effectiveness? Which CPUs and SSDs become non-viable and how does this affect the minimum cost to run a validator? Or maybe the answer is that bandwidth is the only limiting factor and there are zero other problems; that would be great! But do we know that&#39;s the case?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m happy to support a blob increase with the data now to support it. But I feel like I need to be convinced that the gas limit increase is also justified and I just haven&#39;t seen that yet.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-12-07 11:27:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m0wy4ex","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1h8m296","parent_id":"t1_m0uykvo","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"Thank you for bringing these points up. I am also very happy to see that we have now quantitative data to discuss upgrades like this. As you say, they only cover part of it and there definitely are other dimensions to consider than just band width alone. I try to answer them from my personal experience with helping other node operators in their setups:\n\n\nCPU: In my experience CPU is pretty much never the limitation for solo home stakers. In my case processing a block takes between 10 and 100 ms at the moment (NUC13i5). Execution clients, especially Nethermind, have become so much faster in the last few months, that they can easily handle a block increase. The only setups I can imagine having issues are the most low powered ones like the Raspberry Pis. But even there the 5th generation should be fast enough. Some clients are better in handling resource constrained setups, maybe one then just has to find a combination which works for the moment,\n\n\nSSD space: The growth speed increase is definitely substantial, but in the short term, until EIP-4444 greatly reduces the data that needs to be stored in Execution clients, I do not see a big issue. EIP-4444 is decided to go into effect on May 1st 2025. I think here the Verge will help greatly in the next years.\n\n\nSSD speed: I think this is the biggest issue which can hit a few node operators unexpectedly. If you do not have a good enough NVMe SSD there might come a point where your node slowly gets worse attestation efficiencies. Larger block sizes definitely make this issue to creep up sooner. Most people who have issues with their nodes have it due to a cheap SSD. I even had 1 or 2 cases where it all went well at the beginning but slowly went worse over time. I assumed this was due to an SSD which was just barely enough to keep pace and the state size increase made accessing the needed states slightly slower, making the attestation efficiencies just slightly worse over time. One of my own setups had an SSD which was on the ugly list (https://gist.github.com/yorickdowne/f3a3e79a573bf35767cd002cc977b038) and I pushed it a bit too hard to the limit. Changing the consensus client from lighthouse to teku surprisingly helped me getting better attestation efficiencies. Also here future upgrades with the verge help greatly.\n\n\nInternet bandwidth: Is the the one issue where it can be outside of peoples control. If there is no other ISP giving you higher speeds than there is nothing you can do about it. Even in my area the differences are huge within just a few kilometers. I can get a 25 Gbps to my home if I wanted to, but just the next village the highest speed is 30 Mbps that is a 3 orders of magnitude difference. As far as I have heard there are a few node operators which will have issues here. From the research it sounds like the Network will be able to handle an increase, but that does not help the validator who is always slightly behind or cannot push their block fast enough. I think recent changes in that blobs do not have to be distributed with the block helped here. The only other thing might be to consider using a relay to propose block. Definitely a bit worse for the network, but I think a reasonable trade off. \n\n\nInternet connections: As far as I understand ethstaker is working on a standardized setup for a router which will help with a lot of ISP provided cheap routers which limit the network throughput and number of connections possible. They are not ready yet, but in a few months we might have a simple manual to improve that part in the home staker setup.\n\n\nThis is how I see it at the moment and therefore I am for an increase. But one can definitely have a different opinion as not all the available information is that clear cut.\n\nTLDR: most issues in resource constrained setups can probably be handled with some trade offs and switching to different client pairs.
