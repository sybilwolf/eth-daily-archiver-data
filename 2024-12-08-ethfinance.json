And since the merge (over 2 years ago) it's essentially 0%.

Or, alternatively, that it's acquiring monetary premium, i.e. it's trading at a price that is above its intrinsic use as a commodity. People are hoarding it for its investable properties.\n\nThe reason is simple. If you have an asset that is being produced at certain rate, and all of its production is being consumed by the market for its utility as a commodity then it has no monetary premium. It is not perceived as an asset that you hoard because of its investable properties. It has no store of value premium assigned to it. Quite literally everything that is produced is consumed. Therefore all its price is explained by its utility. Coal, corn, soy beans and ETH seem to fit this category.\n\nOn the other hand, an asset that has a monetary premium is acquired beyond its purely utility. It's acquired to hoard it and store value with it. Gold fits this category. Only around 10% of gold's production goes towards industrial use, the rest goes into bank vaults and jewelry. If you think of it, net inflation rate is quite literally the definition of monetary premium. If the asset is produced and is not being consumed, someone is hoarding it.\n\nFor the math in detail, you have it here in a spreadsheet contained inside: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum/\n\nBut it's quite literally a triviality.

On the left is the market for settlement on Ethereum, which depends on use cases, utility, competition of other chains, etc... On the right you have the market for ETH yield. They only meet at a price for ETH. And this price can be calculated, it's the price that makes ETH have 0% inflation. We are here.

It&#39;s acquired to hoard it and store value with it. Gold fits this category. Only around 10% of gold&#39;s production goes towards industrial use, the rest goes into bank vaults and jewelry. If you think of it, net inflation rate is quite literally the definition of monetary premium. If the asset is produced and is not being consumed, someone is hoarding it.</p>\n\n<p>For the math in detail, you have it here in a spreadsheet contained inside: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum/</a></p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s quite literally a triviality. Based on the above, you can argue that ETH should be valued at, at least, the price that results in Burn = Issuance.</p>\n\n<p>Those 2 things don&#39;t need to match, they have different markets even. On the left is the market for settlement on Ethereum, which depends on use cases, utility, competition of other chains, etc... On the right you have the market for ETH yield. They only meet at a price for ETH. And this price can be calculated, it&#39;s the price that makes ETH have 0% inflation. We are here. So ETH is fairly valued as a pure commodity, assuming no growth and no monetary premium. I think this is an extremely conservative valuation.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-12-08 08:31:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m11t9co","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1h9cc2u","parent_id":"t1_m11ltyz","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Ok-Annual6929","body":"DCF model: Eth has shown virtually no growth in network fees since the merge.
