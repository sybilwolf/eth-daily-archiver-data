As some of you may know, I have been involved with some smaller part-time projects lately, primarily in the grants ecosystem. These have included scouting out grant opportunities for EthStaker, getting some funding to finish off and polish the EVMavs project \"RocketSchool\" and I also did some grant work a few months back with an NZ based start-up which the founders ended up putting on hold. Then, at Devcon, having chatted with a few people in the grants ecosystem, I had an idea to create a website that displayed a comprehensive list of ecosystem grants with a brief synopsis of who they're for, criteria, funds available etc since everyone I had talked to at that point thought it was a good idea and was unaware of any existing platforms doing this. After two days of planning how to execute on this, in literally the closing hours of Devcon, I met someone who had already done this and 10x better than I'd have been able to do it.\n\nIt was a bit demoralising after planning so much for my own project but they gave me some people to contact to see if they're looking to hire and since then I have been in discussions with people (watch this space)...\n\nSo, in the spirit of promoting a genuinely useful public good which I can't believe almost nobody I talked to knew existed, if you're interested in finding a grant to fund your project, check out the [KarmaGAP funding map](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/funding-map) for a comprehensive list of grants with filter and search tools, or if you would prefer an AI tool to simply identify what might suit you best, try [ecosystem.vision](https://ecosystem.vision).\n\nAlso, shoutout to KarmaGAP for creating a really cool framework for grantee reputation and tracking with the Grantee Accountability Protocol (GAP) which is aiming to create a standard across grant programs which allows grantors and donors to see how previous funding has facilitated grantee project development. This will be a key stepping stone going forwards to improving the grants ecosystem so that we're utilising our funding as efficiently as possible. I will be writing more on this soon as a follow-up to u/LogrisTheBard's piece on [web 3 crowdfunding.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h8m296/daily_general_discussion_december_7_2024/m0x6jrp/)\n\nIn the mean time, I have decided to continue setting up my own website and service which will aim to raise awareness of grant opportunities through various means and also offer grant consulting and grant writing services to those who need help. So I look forward to announcing something to everyone here soon!\n\nFinally, I have also signed onto a local start-up in the blockchain supply chain tracking space who have some promising partnerships for their app built on Base. This is a part time role and I will be sharing more details on this in tomorrow's daily, but be aware that this is effectively sponsored content. Regardless, I'm excited to share it as they're going for an interesting combo of very serious business-facing real world use case and new age memery to generate a consumer user base beyond their B2B tool.
