This is not sponsored content which I am being paid to post, but I do have a vested interest in the project as I will be getting a 0.2% token allocation alongside salary based compensation for my time. So if you're not interested in such content, feel free to scroll onwards. As per my desire to remain an impartial and independent poster in the community, any posts I make about this project will not be dooted or connected to my role as a moderator of r/EthFinance or r/Ethereum in any way. I will also be keeping posts on it to a minimum beyond major project updates here and there.* With that disclaimer out of the way I will dive right in.\n\nThe project is called [TrackGood](https://www.trackgood.io/) and it is a supply chain transparency and tracking platform being built on Base featuring an integrated ESG LLM and AI agent. It provides an efficient supply chain transparency solution for businesses by tracking all parts of a product's life cycle up to the consumer's purchase, allowing for traceability across complex supply chains and different business entities wherever they are located. This data is put on-chain and a summary/landing page can be accessed by consumers via a QR code on the final product packaging. Where TrackGood starts to differ from other supply chain traceability solutions is with its consumer facing product. Alongside basic info on each product which is updated in real-time, they're also developing what they aim to be the most comprehensive LLM for ESG by:\n\n- Pulling data in real-time from the TrackGood database on Base\n\n- Aggregating publicly available data\n\n- By incentivising users to provide and verify data through $TRAI token incentives for user contributions.\n\nRegarding the token and app, the launch is coming very soon (days/weeks) and it is aiming to be as fair of a launch as possible with just a 5% allocation for the team, 15% for a pre-sale and the remaining 80% being put into a liquidity pool at launch. With a fair-launch focused token distribution, there won't be an inflationary schedule devaluing it right off the bat or VC vesting leading to a future dump.\n\nTo drive consumer interest, we will be launching an AI agent called Traicy, run by our ESG data trained LLM on Twitter/X. While the specifics are still being finalised, the LLM is effectively ready to go and we have an advisor with a history of involvement with successful fair launch tokens taking charge of this aspect of the product. The goal with this is to initiate a positive feedback loop by driving consumer awareness of the product, bringing in more businesses who want to utilise TrackGood. Meanwhile, the token incentives will drive users to feed more data into the TrackGood system to feed the LLM, thus making it more effective and providing more value to everyday consumers.\n\nFinally, regarding the team, I have known the founder for years at this point and he has had this project in the works since 2020. He has been in blockchain for about a decade starting of course with Bitcoin and he has a decades long history of project management and development work in software. The wider team I have only met a few members of, but I can see that it has been very carefully built up over the last few years to bring in expertise from all relevant fields including web 3, accounting, legal, supply chain management and business development.\n\nWith all of that, I'm proud and excited to be a part of this team and I hope it is the first step for both big things for TrackGood and my journey into working in Ethereum!

But I don't want to risk losing a meme war that might hurt ETHs position down the road.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I totally agree that 2x L1 scaling won&#39;t <em>really</em> help. </p>\n\n<p>I also agree that no L1 will ever be good enough to fit the entire &quot;internet of value&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>But scaling the L1 with pragmatic / minimal efforts to make sure the L2-endgame happens in ETH land makes a lot of sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>Let me give you an example that by far not perfect, but maybe helps to understand my position:</p>\n\n<p>When Apple invented the iPhone, they did not ship a touch screen with an OS and a &quot;call&quot; button. They also added very basic apps like an alarm/ watch/ timer, weather, mail, etc. My guess is they knew these apps weren&#39;t the best apps possible and would likely be replaced down the road by better apps. They still invested developer time to build these apps. Why? I guess they wanted to show the world what&#39;s possible. If you ship an &quot;empty&quot; phone, the iPhone might have flopped cause people wouldn&#39;t understand what&#39;s waiting for them down the road. But some basic apps gave them something to play, created basic value and convinced people that this was real innovation. </p>\n\n<p>Now would the iPhone have flopped? We don&#39;t know. (But I doubt it --&gt; not a perfect example tbh) But Apple still wanted to make sure the iPhone succeeds. I think L1 scaling could be like basic apps. Even though we know that down the road L1 blockspace is not the winning product, we want to make sure users aren&#39;t leaving the ecosystem before the &quot;real apps&quot; arrive.  </p>\n\n<p>Last comment with regards to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We need to move+encourage execution on L2s</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At least the encourage part is not a contradiction to <em>also</em> scaling the L1. Same with helping developers build beautiful apps like your base example. We can do both and it&#39;s not even the same entity / people doing it. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want to compete with Solana on L1 execution. But I don&#39;t want to risk losing a meme war that might hurt ETHs position down the road.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-12-12 00:36:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m1nytvs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1hbmz67","parent_id":"t1_m1iu2mf","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"My counterpoint to that would be that I just don't believe we're losing the meme war *because of lackluster L1 scaling*.\n\nI think the mindshare we're losing is precisely because we have a bunch of moneymen with an audience, acting like haughty sophisticated elitists, having \"thoughtful discussions\" which mostly boil down to sniffing their own farts.\n\nWhen you turn back the clock to 2018/2019, when the dapp ecosystem started to go beyond just passionate programmers.
