So many talking about Ethereum \"underperforming\", when in reality it's not underperforming at all, it's literally number 2 behind Bitcoin, and no alt L1 is close in 3rd.\n\nWhen people talk about \"underperformance\" it's normally on some cherry picked selective timeframe like \"over the past week\" or \"year to date\". But all of those timeframes are just noise.\n\nIt really amazes me how many smart people get sucked into this strange narrative. For example, compared to Solana. I'm not picking on Solana especially, it's just an illustrative alt L1!\n\n* That if for example, Solana can go from a **$43bn** market cap to **$104bn** in 2024, that is apparently some kind of \"outperformance\" and they are doing something better than Ethereum.\n* But when Ethereum goes from a **$274bn** market cap, to a **$487bn** market cap in 2024, that's underperformance, and we are losing.\n\nThe basis for this \"take\" on performance, is that the Solana gain is 141%, and Ethereum is only up 77% on the year. And that is entirely true, if your goal was to make more money as an investor, in that precise timeframe. But the amount of money one can make investing in a given cherry picked timeframe, has absolutely no relation to the overall success of an ecosystem like Ethereum.\n\nDo you know how hard it is to add $213bn to a market cap? A lot harder than adding $61bn that's for sure. When thinking about the overall success of the ecosystem, it's probably slightly better (though certainly still far from perfect) to think of the total value added, rather than the percentage gain in a timeframe.\n\nEthereum had to work so hard, and gain so much legitimacy to get to this almost half trillion market cap. The higher you go, the more legitimacy you need, and the more scrutiny you face. None of these alt L1s are playing in the same league. It's a bit like saying that because a soccer team in a small local league scores more goals, they must be better than the EPL champions who scored less.\n\nIt's obviously easier to make larger returns starting from a smaller marketcap, but as an investor, you are also taking on more risk investing in an unproven and more speculative asset. And yes, if you want to make more money, you probably do need to take more risks. If I create a small tech start-up, and our valuation increases by 500% in the first year, that doesn't mean we are about to overthrow Microsoft since their stock only gained 20%. It's certain my investors will be very happy their risk paid off, but they are under no illusion that I'm about to put Microsoft out of business,\n\nThis constant confusion between \"financial gain for an investor over a given period\" and \"overall success of the ecosystem\" is really something to behold.
