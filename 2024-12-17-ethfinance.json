Additionally, the Usability track aimed to improve the user experience of Ethereum, focusing on patterns and design processes for better accessibility. The Core Protocol track explored topics such as the Ethereum protocol's future and proof of stake, aiming to cater to different levels of expertise. The Real-World Use Cases track showcased practical Ethereum applications, while the Applied Cryptography track delved into advanced cryptography topics related to Ethereum. Other tracks covered coordination, cyberpunk values, security, cryptoeconomics, and layer 2 solutions. Attendees were encouraged to use the DevCon passport app for easy access to the event schedule, live streams, translations, and interactive features like speaker Q&A and lightning talks.
