Trezor has been in the space for a very long time so I assume they know what they are doing. As I was not sure how well it will work with my setup I went with the cheaper option (Trezor Safe 3) instead of the more expensive one (Trezor Safe 5). Security wise they are pretty much the same but the Trezor 5 has a touch screen. Just make sure to not get a Trezor One or the Model T as they do not have a secure element chip which makes them more vulnerable to attacks. There is also no Trezor with bluetooth, so if you depended on that, Trezor is probably not for you.\n\nThe Trezor 3 has pretty much a similar feel like the Leder Nano S. Pretty minimal design and als the screen is a monochrome screen. One difference is that you can operate the trezor with one hand only. There is also the equivalent of Ledger Live which is called Trezor suite. I do not think Trezor Suite is particularly useful though. I prefer to do my stuff in third party wallets. Setup is similar to setting up a Ledger. You can chose a pin, a passphrase etc. \n\nI tested my wallets with Frame.sh, Rabby and Metamask. One important thing is that the Trezor Suite has to run even though you only want to connect to a browser wallet.  UPDATE May 2025: This was an issue with my setup. My browser (Ubuntu Chromium) could not connect to the Trezor wallet directly and had to go through the Trezor Suite. Reinstalled my browser in a different way and now it works directly.\n\nIn Frame.sh I can only find my Ledger Legacy wallets and the first one in the Ledger Live derivation path. All other ones in this path cannot be accessed. Same with Metamask.

Trezor has been in the space for a very long time so I assume they know what they are doing. As I was not sure how well it will work with my setup I went with the cheaper option (Trezor Safe 3) instead of the more expensive one (Trezor Safe 5). Security wise they are pretty much the same but the Trezor 5 has a touch screen. Just make sure to not get a Trezor One or the Model T as they do not have a secure element chip which makes them more vulnerable to attacks. There is also no Trezor with bluetooth, so if you depended on that, Trezor is probably not for you.</p>\n\n<p>The Trezor 3 has pretty much a similar feel like the Leder Nano S. Pretty minimal design and als the screen is a monochrome screen. One difference is that you can operate the trezor with one hand only. There is also the equivalent of Ledger Live which is called Trezor suite. I do not think Trezor Suite is particularly useful though. I prefer to do my stuff in third party wallets. Setup is similar to setting up a Ledger. You can chose a pin, a passphrase etc. </p>\n\n<p>I tested my wallets with Frame.sh, Rabby and Metamask. One important thing is that the Trezor Suite has to run even though you only want to connect to a browser wallet.  UPDATE May 2025: This was an issue with my setup. My browser (Ubuntu Chromium) could not connect to the Trezor wallet directly and had to go through the Trezor Suite. Reinstalled my browser in a different way and now it works directly.</p>\n\n<p>In Frame.sh I can only find my Ledger Legacy wallets and the first one in the Ledger Live derivation path. All other ones in this path cannot be accessed. Same with Metamask. This is a consequence of Ledger not using the standard derivation paths.</p>\n\n<p>Rabby easily finds all my wallets and I can use them perfectly. If you confirm a transaction in Rabby an additional window pops up which connects to the Trezor and through which the transaction is confirmed. It works, but is a bit ugly. </p>\n\n<p>The trezor itself is relatively simple. There are no settings to configure the device itself. No apps you have to upload and choose. The screen is slightly more informative than on the Ledger Nano S and you can actually see what you are signing. Security wise this is so much better than the blind signing on the Ledger. </p>\n\n<p>Your device gets wiped if you input the pin wrongly 16 times, which is much more often than on the Ledger which wipes itself after 3 wrong pin inputs.
