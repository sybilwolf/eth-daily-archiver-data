I have a few questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What would you recommend as a tick range? I am thinking of +-30% of the current Eth price.</li>\n<li>Given the range above, should the price of eth fall below my range I will find myself with a position fully made of Eth (with my average eth &quot;purchase&quot; price being somewhere in the low part of the defined range). Should it go above instead, I will have only USDC (with my average eth sell price somewhere in the high part of the range). Is my interpretation correct?</li>\n<li>How much gas does it cost roughly to adjust ticks every once in a while?</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-12-24 11:42:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m3mzlca","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1hl83c1","parent_id":"t3_1hl83c1","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/shiftli","body":"Have a look at revert.finance, they allow to configure your position for auto-adjust and auto-compounding I believe.
