My key concerns are 3:\n\n\n- What if I lose access to my key?\n- What if my key gets stolen?\n- How do I keep managing my finances in a simple way from my phone?\n\nI think that using a 2/3 Safe multisig with the following keys should address all the points above:\n\n\n- A phone wallet key (Safe wallet)\n- A security key (Trezor?)\n- An emergency key (a piece of paper with an encrypted passphrase)\n\nConcerning point 1: Should I lose access to my phone, or the Trezor, or the emergency paper key, all my funds are safe. I just need to use the two remaining keys to replace the lost one with a new one.\n\n\nConcerning point 2: Should an attacker steal my phone, or rob my house, I'd still have access to two keys to replace the stolen one.\n\n\nConcerning point 3: For my everyday activities the single key in my Safe phone wallet should suffice, as you can set a conservative transaction limit below which only that key signature is necessary. Beyond a set transaction size, I'd need to additionally provide a \"security\" signature with the trezor.\n\nThis is actually a fairly common setup in some banks. My current one gives me a security Bluetooth token to be used in combination with my phone app in case of big transactions. Should I lose one of those, I can get in touch with my bank to get it replaced. In a self custodial context, this last role is essentially fulfilled by the two remaining keys.\n\n\nI would actually love to see a service which acts as an emergency key custodian: they can't access your funds, but they can help you recover them. Argent already does this with their wallet by appointing themselves as a default guardian, but unfortunately they do have no plans on supporting other L2s besides Starknet. Hence why I am looking into switching to Safe.\n\n\nEDIT: Found out it is possible to set up a trusted recovery process with time lock for a Safe account!

My key concerns are 3:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What if I lose access to my key?</li>\n<li>What if my key gets stolen?</li>\n<li>How do I keep managing my finances in a simple way from my phone?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think that using a 2/3 Safe multisig with the following keys should address all the points above:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A phone wallet key (Safe wallet)</li>\n<li>A security key (Trezor?)</li>\n<li>An emergency key (a piece of paper with an encrypted passphrase)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Concerning point 1: Should I lose access to my phone, or the Trezor, or the emergency paper key, all my funds are safe. I just need to use the two remaining keys to replace the lost one with a new one.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning point 2: Should an attacker steal my phone, or rob my house, I&#39;d still have access to two keys to replace the stolen one.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning point 3: For my everyday activities the single key in my Safe phone wallet should suffice, as you can set a conservative transaction limit below which only that key signature is necessary. Beyond a set transaction size, I&#39;d need to additionally provide a &quot;security&quot; signature with the trezor.</p>\n\n<p>This is actually a fairly common setup in some banks. My current one gives me a security Bluetooth token to be used in combination with my phone app in case of big transactions. Should I lose one of those, I can get in touch with my bank to get it replaced. In a self custodial context, this last role is essentially fulfilled by the two remaining keys.</p>\n\n<p>I would actually love to see a service which acts as an emergency key custodian: they can&#39;t access your funds, but they can help you recover them.

Posting over here since we will migrating in a few days anyway)*\n\nSo I have been tap dancing around ethena for the last few months, and I feel like I have a good understanding of their stablecoin and \"where the yield comes from\". We all remember terra luna and what a disaster that was. Initially, I got those same vibes with sUSDe. 20%+ APY on a \"stablecoin\"? Scam. It's just years of crypto PTSD. I bet many of you are the same way. However, I don't think ethena and terra luna are in the same category. From what I can tell, the yield on sUSDe is above board, albeit a little more complicated of a financial tool than I have been used to. \n\nThere is some counterparty risk with the centralized entities holding the derivative positions that are funded by purchasers of USDe, and your typical smart contract risk. If you are holding sUSDe, there is a 7 day withdrawal period which adds \"time\" risk. If everyone wants out at the same time, they aren't going to wait 7 days, and one can easily imagine a depegging event being caused by this. Because of this risk (assumption **MINE**), ethena recently announced that they are launching *another* stablecoin (USDtb), in partnership with the big baddie itself, blackrock. USDtb will hold 90% of its reserves in blackrock's BUIDL fund, which will also act as a backstop for liquidity events involving sUSDe. This should somewhat lower the liquidity risk associated with sUSDe. Ethena has grown to 6 billion quatloos off of these products, and I have had no issues with any of them thus far. I've done well buying pendle PT's, and buying USDe and staking it directly. Despite all of this...I am still hesitant to throw some real volume at these guys. I may need some more convincing.\n\nThere was recently a vote that passed aave governance that enabled e-mode for sUSDe, and they upped the deposit cap to 1.15 billion. E-mode enables borrowing of stables against sUSDe up to 90% LTV. Best I can tell based on the praise this approval has received for allowing greater \"capital efficiency\"... it's being used exclusively to lever up more sUSDe. I have questions about why one would do this. As of this morning, sUSDe APY is 10%. Tethers borrow rate is 11.75, USDC is 13.24. Anyone doing this is losing money. A week or two ago, the sUSDe rate was 27%. With rates that high, yeah, you can profit. But these lending and borrow rates move quickly. How is one supposed to have a position like this with any certainty? Am I missing something?\n\nWith 90% LTV on aave and by looping the borrows.... $5000 worth of sUSDe can have $35000 borrowed against it. a 5% depegging down liquidates this. This...seems....suboptimal? I assume that most borrowers are levered to the max here...because why else vote to increase the max LTV from 75% to 90% unless you intended to do so? I may have a fundamental misunderstanding of financial markets, but this seems crazy to me. Someone talk me through this.\n\nThere is one more known unknown here, and that is the farming of ethena points. If looping like this generates $35000 worth of points from $5000, despite you losing money every block to have it opened, then I suppose you are just betting on the value of the eventual ENA tokens. Ratio of points to tokens is unknown.\n\nWhat is the main strategy for doing this kind of looping and how are people profiting when borrow APR > underlying APY? Are there any fancy plays surrounding the ENA token and points farming? If I want to bet on an eventual collapse of this system where everyone is looped 700% over the initial deposit...what do I short? sUSDe? ENA? Who is even selling long dated shorts on stuff like this? Would blackrock/ethena *allow* such a collapse to occur?
