The talk covered three main areas: the nuances of L2s keeping fees and paying for blobs, the generation of ETH-denominated activity by L2s, and the dynamic relationship between L2s and Ethereum. They explored the complexities of blob fee market dynamics, the usage of ETH as a gas token versus an asset, and potential scenarios where L2s could become more extractive, posing challenges for the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, they highlighted the uncertainty around how L2s may react under different scenarios, emphasizing the need for further analysis and monitoring as the ecosystem evolves.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nHow can the usage of ETH as a gas token versus an asset impact the development and sustainability of Layer 2 solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n\n\nIn what ways could the potential extractive nature of Layer 2 solutions pose challenges for the wider Ethereum community, and what strategies could be implemented to mitigate these challenges?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
