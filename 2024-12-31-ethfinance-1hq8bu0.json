The great people, knowledge, and care that I've seen demonstrated here gives me hope for the future. It is not a coincidence though, as this sub is a reflection of the heart of Ethereum and the values its community carries. We are a strong part of that community and I am so happy and proud to see us carry what has been built here over to r/Ethereum to share this special place with the world.\n\n\nI started lurking in early 2021 when I had finally decided to check out \"crypto.\" Ironically, I found this sub through r/Ethereum and quickly realized this is the place to be (oh, and r/Ethstaker too!), due to all you great people.\n\n\n\nThis sub changed my trajectory, as I was playing around with BTC, XRP, ADA, Doge, and ETH to understand the space. After reading for a bit here, I converted everything to ETH as it was clear to me it is the future. On this I have no regrets, despite any price action; this technology will change the world for the better.\n\n\n\nI started staking pre-merge, about 6 months after genesis, and started chiming in here; I was fortunate enough to mint an EVMaverick, which I cherish more than anything else in my digital resume. I will never sell it.\n\n\nWhen the crash came, I was so convinced from this sub that I scooped as much ETH as I could, using support targets from u/KBrot and u/ab111292 to make some spectacular buys, including a validator's worth at $980. I've now taken my cost basis from starting near the ATH down to the low $1300's, below the 2018 peak! I can't claim to be an OG, but I do think I've proven my conviction when the going got tough.\n\n\n\nNow I've been playing with developing in Solidity as a hobby for a couple years, through the bear,\u00a0which has only strengthened my convictions. I hope one day to transition from my Web2 job into Web3. In the meantime, I hope to bring Web3/Ethereum to my current organization.\n\n\n\nDeveloping on and playing with Ethereum has led to many other amazing opportunities, and I've now met, in person: Vitalik, Justin Drake, Paul Brody, and some other very passionate and inspiring people.

At the time I was just looking to buy and hold crypto as an investment like I had for tech stocks before that. I looked up a video by Vitalik, was unimpressed by his presentation quality and ideas (he has gotten better), and was deciding whether to buy some ETH on Coinbase in the same way I might buy silver instead of gold because it has higher volatility.\n\nUsually (but not always) the first to market product of a type is the one to bet on (e.g. Lido). But there are exceptions when the new one is 10x better than the predecessors (e.g. WoW, iPhone). When I learned that Ethereum was Turing complete and Bitcoin wasn't I immediately understood that was a 10x improvement and bought my first ETH. With the conviction of that ground truth I was never going to be a Bitcoin maxi until they hard forked in equivalent programmability.\n\nThen began my decent into [The Rabbit Hole](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole). The ethtrader reddit at the time had a **booming** altcoin discussion page. I miss that culture. The subreddit was buzzing daily with everyone shilling everything Ethereum would make possible. We would discuss apps and their potential before they even had a smart contract. We were going to disrupt everything from copyright, to Uber, to all of Tradfi. This was and remains a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.\n\nCrypto was still small enough at the time that regulators were still just ignoring us rather than laughing and then fighting us. We hadn't yet been scammed enough to understand due diligence. The price was going up fast enough that fundamentals didn't even matter anyway. ICOs were the OG memecoins except instead of peddling farts and dogs we were peddling dreams. I watched ETH 4x and my investments 7x. Then I watched ETH drop 95% and my investments 1/4x. But I stuck around and I kept learning.\n\nI learned the core values of Ethereum culture from people like /u/DCInvestor and /u/superphiz. I learned TA from people like /u/MrsWilly. I learned technical details from people like /u/domotheus and /u/hanniabu. I lurked. My first post was something very timely about a price breakout on some altcoin. Eventually I started engaging with questions about where to find good data. I once asked a question about the upcoming beacon chain and Vitalik himself dropped by with Github link directly to the code that implemented it. I collected dashboards into a browser bookmark folder. I curated a Youtube and Twitter feed of quality information. Discords weren't really in style yet. Lastly, I started discussing what I learned about fundamentals investing with the people here.\n\nEventually I started posting about projects that I thought had legs and would survive the bear market and thrive. I kept having to dig these posts out of my history and cite them as the topic come up in dailies weeks and months later so I built another bookmark folder of my own reddit posts. I had about 20 or so of these ranging from projects like KNC, NEXO, KCS. I had some real losers I held down to dust too. I mean, things you've *never* heard of like NCASH, BNTY, or WABI. Still, as a mix when 20% of your bets lose everything and the other 80% 10x, you're doing great. This was around 2020, before the next bull even really started.\n\nIn the time between jobs my wife made a website and had me load some of those token analysis posts onto it as pages. This is why it's so oddly named for the content on there today. Originally it was mostly deep dives on the mechanics of various projects tokens and dashboards/analysis on why they were underpriced/overpriced. Slowly, maintaining the data and conclusions on those became tiring and the nature of what I was writing about shifted from investment opportunities to less ephemeral topics like the fundamentals of various trends in tokenomics, game theory, blockchains, and finance. My blog took over the site.\n\nEventually, some people from here began asking me directly for various advisory services. I helped people initialize their private key security, agreed to help recover funds from the chain upon their death, helped people build risk-adjusted liquidity farming portfolios, and did official writing work for DAOs. [I still do](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/consulting/) upon request btw. Then came Hodlercon and things got more serious. We raised a few $10k in crowdsourced funds + a donation from Phiz, the madlad, and I got to meet some of the most committed and wonderful people I'd spent these years with. I recall multiple times sitting on a beach, by a playground, or on a bus and talking through ideas with someone we're like \"this is a good idea, someone should build this.\" Then we have a collective realization: \"oh shit, someone is us\". Like, we *weren't* builders but the weight of it just settles on you and mentally you get to work. So what started as a few odd hours became full projects and then the next year one of those connections (a lurker here) introduced me to the CEO and lead investor of a VC. At their event, I met other VCs. So I started doing [exploratory research](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/next-gen-nfts) for VCs and threw that on the project pile. At this point I have ongoing work with about 10 teams and it's solidly part-time plus a full time role as a CTO. Crypto pays you to learn about it. Not just airdrops. It's a space brimming with opportunity. This Rabbit Hole gradually sucked me in and changed my life from one just selling hours to megacorps and contributing to wealth inequality to one where I can focus more of my time on world-saving ventures.\n\nSomewhere along the way this community added things that were silly at first and are gradually becoming more serious too. The EVMavericks were just another NFT collection. A fun detour like YAMs. Then a volunteer workforce began curating the best of what we wrote and made a podcast. This was nice but could have just been ignored. But then we started bringing on guests. I became a sort of unofficial technical interviewer like I do for VCs in shark-tank style meetings. Then those guests started to become more serious, the topics more advanced and impactful. We're scheduling people like Justin Drake now. We got a retroactive grant from Octant. It's now another paid pathway for me to meet people and teach/learn others about this space.\n\nAs we merge with /r/ethereum here is what I hope we make of it in the years to come. I want the community to remain education focused. I want us to train up the next cohort in all the things I learned here when I joined in 2017. Be patient. Engage with newcomers and their questions. Shape your answers to entice them to explore more rather than making them feel stupid for asking.\n\nI want us to bring back more app-focused content to the space. Podcasts like Bankless don't focus as much on this anymore now that they're busy talking to Senators and Tradfi funds like Bitwise. I miss the energy of the altcoin thread. I don't miss the blind shilling and people just shouting \"REQ!\" into the void, but I do miss the discussion of the grand vision, everything the chain makes possible, and what the next dev cycle will bring.\n\nWe need to grow the community to bring back the lively discussion. We can use the EVMavericks podcast to bring in app team leaders from other projects and expose some of their community to ours. Engage with us and let's get a packed backlog of guests. The daily discussion could use a good dose of this content too. On boring days, make an effort to learn about some up and coming application and bring that knowledge back home. Learn, earn, and return.\n\nLastly, [be dreamers again](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/to-the-dreamers).

They explain the concept of rollups as a blockchain utilizing another blockchain for ordering and data availability, contrasting it with bridges that use proofs. The speaker emphasizes the need for clear language to foster collaboration and innovation, urging the community to establish shared definitions for terms like rollup and bridge. They conclude by advocating for a unified understanding to propel Ethereum's development forward, referencing the SpaceX booster landing as an example of shared definitions leading to success.
