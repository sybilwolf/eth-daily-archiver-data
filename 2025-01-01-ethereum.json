Over the years, I've taken my self-appointed role as \"ethfinance tutelary\" very seriously.  I don't comment often, but I'd like to think I've played a part in shaping the ethfinance ethos, and in helping our community navigate various challenges.  I'm tremendously grateful to Ethereum, which has transformed my life for the better since 2017.  \n\nGiven my patience, and my expertise in economic decision analysis, I've always found the crypto game easy.  If I wanted to be evil, I'd be a supremely competent villain.  That said, I much prefer supporting efforts to make the world a better place.  The beauty of Ethereum is that I don't have to choose between being positive-sum oriented and enhancing my financial freedom.  \n\nI imagine newer folks thinking \"That's easy for you to say; you had years to buy under $300.\"  Fair enough, but I remain very confident in ETH's abilily to deliver big gains, given time for the speculative process to play out.  At the risk of oversimplifying a complex phenomenon, ETH makes you wait because it's the obvious choice as the backbone of the internet of value.  \n\nThe crypto market is ruthless.  If the whales and AI bots can milk you one more time, they will.  They'll nibble at your conviction until you give in to the liars and bullies on CT.  They'll push the ratio until 2019-2020 accumulators get nervous.  There will be market panics and liquidation cascades.  Then, just when the obvious gold standard looks more like a shit standard, the dam will break.  \n\nTrends stretched too far will snap back.  Network growth and technical progress will become undeniable.  A few major defectors will bet against the bearish consensus, and the anti-ETH chorus will turn on a dime.  Influencers will claim they saw it coming.  ATH will come and go, and everyone will get excited about the march to $10k and beyond.  $25k in 2025 could easily become reality.  \n\nSomething that rhymes with the above is likely, but I can't predict when it will happen.  If you want real gains from the obvious play, you have to be patient.  While you wait, accumulate ETH, explore the ecosystem, and follow along in the Daily.  This community has the best SNR in crypto.

Over the years, I&#39;ve taken my self-appointed role as &quot;ethfinance tutelary&quot; very seriously.  I don&#39;t comment often, but I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve played a part in shaping the ethfinance ethos, and in helping our community navigate various challenges.  I&#39;m tremendously grateful to Ethereum, which has transformed my life for the better since 2017.  </p>\n\n<p>Given my patience, and my expertise in economic decision analysis, I&#39;ve always found the crypto game easy.  If I wanted to be evil, I&#39;d be a supremely competent villain.  That said, I much prefer supporting efforts to make the world a better place.  The beauty of Ethereum is that I don&#39;t have to choose between being positive-sum oriented and enhancing my financial freedom.  </p>\n\n<p>I imagine newer folks thinking &quot;That&#39;s easy for you to say; you had years to buy under $300.&quot;  Fair enough, but I remain very confident in ETH&#39;s abilily to deliver big gains, given time for the speculative process to play out.  At the risk of oversimplifying a complex phenomenon, ETH makes you wait because it&#39;s the obvious choice as the backbone of the internet of value.  </p>\n\n<p>The crypto market is ruthless.  If the whales and AI bots can milk you one more time, they will.  They&#39;ll nibble at your conviction until you give in to the liars and bullies on CT.  They&#39;ll push the ratio until 2019-2020 accumulators get nervous.  There will be market panics and liquidation cascades.  Then, just when the obvious gold standard looks more like a shit standard, the dam will break.  </p>\n\n<p>Trends stretched too far will snap back.  Network growth and technical progress will become undeniable.  A few major defectors will bet against the bearish consensus, and the anti-ETH chorus will turn on a dime.  Influencers will claim they saw it coming.  ATH will come and go, and everyone will get excited about the march to $10k and beyond.  $25k in 2025 could easily become reality.  </p>\n\n<p>Something that rhymes with the above is likely, but I can&#39;t predict when it will happen.  If you want real gains from the obvious play, you have to be patient.  While you wait, accumulate ETH, explore the ecosystem, and follow along in the Daily.
