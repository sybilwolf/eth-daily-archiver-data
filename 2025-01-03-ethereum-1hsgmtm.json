The ticker is ETH. ETH itself needs to be valuable in order to guarantee the continued functioning of the chain.  Without ETH value there will be no stakers, no block proposers, no block builders, no transactions, no chain.\n\nThe second piece is information.  ETH needs to be [expressive enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSN5BaCzsbo&ab_channel=TechCrunch) to contain the various pieces of information that we find useful to put on-chain. Bitcoin is minimally expressive so it was highly limited in the amount of information it could store on-chain. Ethereum expanded the expressiveness to essentially infinity with a turing-complete programming language (Solidity) for smart contracts.\n\nNow anyone can write any smart contract, put it onchain, and anyone in the world can instantly interact with that system.  I also believe that Ethereum has passed the bottleneck stage (for the most part) with fees such that it isn't too expensive to put information into the chain anymore.  [L2 tvl suggests so at least](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl).\n\nBeing able to rely on the chain, and the information stored on it, to persist into the future relies on the decentralization of the network.  The more decentralized it is the more likely it is to be resistant to attacks of all sorts, be it cultural/physical/financial.  Essentially it creates the most neutral credibility in terms of users being able to rely on it to function as intended.\n\nAdditionally, network effects exist all over the place for ETH.  Some examples:\n\n1) mindshare and number of holders who are committed to the network and the ideas behind it rather than just trying to make a quick buck or scamming people \n\n2) Solo staker ecosystem which supports the foundational community which credibly runs the hardware that the Ethereum software controls, the source of ETH's credibility. \n\n3) Core dev commmunity. Required to improve and maintain the functioning of the Ethereum network.\n\n4) Builder commnuity.  Improving solidity code, improving our understanding of how to implement the EVM every day, improving smart contract auditing and tooling.  \n\n5) Smart contract network and liquidity.  The existing smart contracts that have been deployed are like the buildings in a city. If the core devs and solo stakers are the road/sidewalk builders transporting you around the system. The smart contracts and teams that have deployed them are the libraries, schools, offices, banks that you can interact with.  The more of these exist in a city the more vibrant the city becomes which is why people all clump together.  Same for smart contract network states.\n\nThere's more but that's just some examples.  \n\nI'd like to propose another form of valuing Ethereum which is the amount of human \"work\" that it secures.  I think by this metric it shouuld be the most valueable asset on the planet bar none.  \"But haven't lots of other companies spent 1000x more human hours?\" Yes of course. However not all human hours can be counted the same.  Think about all the human hours that go into maintaining an exchange in traditional finance world.  It's huge.  Now you deploy [uniswap contract](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works) which is a fancy version of x * y = k and viola, you have SOLVED exchanging tokens. Basically for all humans for all time.  I still don't think people understand HOW MUCH human effort smart contracts contain within them.  They are the most consolidated, most efficient, human effort in history.  They are the blueprint, the instructions, the software, that controls a fleet of hardware dispersed across the entire world, telling them exactly how to do operations that humans would otherwise have to spend countless hours doing manually.\n\nThe more that this system's functionality expands, the easier it gets to use. Network effects.  Eventually it will consume the majority of at least the digital world's activity.  You need ETH to operate this computer.  You don't have enough ETH.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum&#39;s main value proposition in my opinion is from securing the  information and value on its network.</p>\n\n<p>The value part is obvious.  The ticker is ETH. ETH itself needs to be valuable in order to guarantee the continued functioning of the chain.  Without ETH value there will be no stakers, no block proposers, no block builders, no transactions, no chain.</p>\n\n<p>The second piece is information.  ETH needs to be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSN5BaCzsbo&amp;ab_channel=TechCrunch\">expressive enough</a> to contain the various pieces of information that we find useful to put on-chain. Bitcoin is minimally expressive so it was highly limited in the amount of information it could store on-chain. Ethereum expanded the expressiveness to essentially infinity with a turing-complete programming language (Solidity) for smart contracts.</p>\n\n<p>Now anyone can write any smart contract, put it onchain, and anyone in the world can instantly interact with that system.  I also believe that Ethereum has passed the bottleneck stage (for the most part) with fees such that it isn&#39;t too expensive to put information into the chain anymore.  <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl\">L2 tvl suggests so at least</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to rely on the chain, and the information stored on it, to persist into the future relies on the decentralization of the network.  The more decentralized it is the more likely it is to be resistant to attacks of all sorts, be it cultural/physical/financial.  Essentially it creates the most neutral credibility in terms of users being able to rely on it to function as intended.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, network effects exist all over the place for ETH.  Some examples:</p>\n\n<p>1) mindshare and number of holders who are committed to the network and the ideas behind it rather than just trying to make a quick buck or scamming people </p>\n\n<p>2) Solo staker ecosystem which supports the foundational community which credibly runs the hardware that the Ethereum software controls, the source of ETH&#39;s credibility. </p>\n\n<p>3) Core dev commmunity. Required to improve and maintain the functioning of the Ethereum network.</p>\n\n<p>4) Builder commnuity.  Improving solidity code, improving our understanding of how to implement the EVM every day, improving smart contract auditing and tooling.  </p>\n\n<p>5) Smart contract network and liquidity.  The existing smart contracts that have been deployed are like the buildings in a city. If the core devs and solo stakers are the road/sidewalk builders transporting you around the system. The smart contracts and teams that have deployed them are the libraries, schools, offices, banks that you can interact with.  The more of these exist in a city the more vibrant the city becomes which is why people all clump together.  Same for smart contract network states.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s more but that&#39;s just some examples.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to propose another form of valuing Ethereum which is the amount of human &quot;work&quot; that it secures.  I think by this metric it shouuld be the most valueable asset on the planet bar none.  &quot;But haven&#39;t lots of other companies spent 1000x more human hours?&quot; Yes of course. However not all human hours can be counted the same.  Think about all the human hours that go into maintaining an exchange in traditional finance world.  It&#39;s huge.  Now you deploy <a href=\"https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works\">uniswap contract</a> which is a fancy version of x * y = k and viola, you have SOLVED exchanging tokens. Basically for all humans for all time.  I still don&#39;t think people understand HOW MUCH human effort smart contracts contain within them.  They are the most consolidated, most efficient, human effort in history.  They are the blueprint, the instructions, the software, that controls a fleet of hardware dispersed across the entire world, telling them exactly how to do operations that humans would otherwise have to spend countless hours doing manually.</p>\n\n<p>The more that this system&#39;s functionality expands, the easier it gets to use. Network effects.  Eventually it will consume the majority of at least the digital world&#39;s activity.  You need ETH to operate this computer.  You don&#39;t have enough ETH.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-03 11:00:23","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-01-03 11:23:59","id":"m58664s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1hsgmtm","parent_id":"t3_1hsgmtm","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"> You don't have enough ETH\n\n\nThis seat is occupied","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>You don&#39;t have enough ETH</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seat is occupied</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-03 19:25:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m5aqky8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1hsgmtm","parent_id":"t1_m58664s","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/KuDeTa","body":"Still trying to overcome the muscle memory that takes me to ethfinance.
