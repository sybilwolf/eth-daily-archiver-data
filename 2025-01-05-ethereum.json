Sorry.\n\n> What do you constitute as a \"Stock Trade\"?\n\nA change of legal beneficial ownership, for consideration.\n\n> I would constitute a trade as one that is publicly viewable or \"Lit\". It is proof that the trade happened/exists.\n\nIf two people trade tokens on a privacy-enhanced blockchain, I wouldn't say that the trade \"didn't happen\" for the reason that it's not viewable to the public. In the same vein, if two people meet up in private to swap gold coins for silver rounds, I consider those people as having traded. To me, a trade is a trade regardless of whether there is proof.\n\n> If it is not \"Lit\" I would not constitute it as a trade, because it has no bearing on the market.\n\nIn my opinion the trade is just as much a part of \"the market\" as a public trade would have been. Personally I define \"the market\" as the total set of buyers and sellers who are currently willing to transact with strangers at specific prices. So public order books, private order books, hypothetically even people swapping stock certificates on the street, I consider all of it to be \"the market\".\n\nWikipedia likewise defines the stock market as \"the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks\".\n\n> If the DTC/DTCC chooses to collude with market makers/brokers/etc. who are we to say whether or not the purchases that you are making that do not go to \"Lit\" markets are even happening at all?\n>\n> What if they don't even need to collude with the DTCC, just simply don't register the shares/stocks that their customers are buying with the DTC.\n>\n> Who is to say that your positions are actually getting registered with Cede & Co.

Because a trade is defined as a change of beneficial ownership, the courts are ultimately the ones who determine whether a particular disputed trade happened or not. \n\nUltimately, we have to trust statutorily required audits and reports (and whistleblowers) to protect us proactively from brokerages and clearinghouses lying and saying they own stock shares that they know they do not actually own.\n\nHave you heard of any US brokerage that turned out to be holding fake assets on their books? I think someone more knowledgeable than me could probably explain how investment banking reporting/auditing requirements would turn up missing stock within days or even hours, causing certain government agencies to put the brokerage into receivership. But you're right, from the perspective of my limited knowledge, I have to just trust that these regulations force brokerages to keep balanced books of stock shares.\n\nYes, of course fraud happens all the time on Wall St. But the type of fraud that regularly happens on Wall St isn't brokerages being fooled by fake shares of stock from other brokerages, or clearinghouses issuing fake shares. I really wish I had the knowledge to quote you specific parts of brokerage regulation, but that specific type of fraud would be rooted out pretty quickly.\n\nClearinghouses in particular are hot on the government's radar, because a loss of trust in US clearinghouses would mean an overnight end to US global hegemony. The US is too smart to roll the dice on permanently losing global power like that.\n\nIf you think about it, fake stock is a type of fraud that could easily ruin an ultrawealthy person too, I'm talking potentially wiping out their entire portfolio in an instant if someone realizes all their stock is fake. The ultrawealthy don't sweat their brokerage accounts, because they know that other ultrawealthy people over the last century have hardened those specific regulations to make sure their brokerage can't possibly fake their shares so that they can no longer afford their private jets and yachts when they go to sell.\n\nBasically, the most powerful people in the world would be greatly affected by a clearinghouse-brokerage conspiracy, as it undermines the root of capitalism itself - the very concept of ownership of capital. Thus, DTCC is watched from inside and out, legally and extralegally.\n\n> Also, if the exchanges/brokers/market makers \"must\" hold the underlying shares/stocks and something is forcing them to do this, explain this story to me\n\nNaked shorting is where you sell shares that you don't actually own, then when settlement time comes and you need to deliver them, you purchase them on the spot in order to deliver (or you fail to deliver). It's a dynamic process, like floating a check. It's difficult for authorities to spot fake checks flying around before they settle (1 day, for stocks). The damage is limited to funds/shares in motion. Funds/shares at rest are safe.\n\nThis is way different than a person holding natural shares of settled stock in a brokerage account that they later discover to be fake. That's more like people discovering that a bank's vault doesn't actually have any gold in it. It's easy for authorities to walk into a vault regularly and see if there's enough gold there. It's a static process. Same with balances of stock shares.\n\n> Market makers create liquidity out of thin air and match trades when there is no liquidity, when the market maker DOES NOT own the underlying.\n\nTrades can be *matched* when there is no liquidity, but they cannot be *settled*. Yes, it's possible that the stock you just bought might \"bounce\" (FTD, or Failure To Deliver) when it goes to settle the next day. But if/when it does settle next day, that's it. You have the stock.\n\nSo trading liquidity can be created out of thin air, but settled stock shares cannot.\n\nIn summary, I believe the idea of DTCC colluding with brokerages to create fake shares doesn't pass the \"conspiracy threshold\" test. If DTCC were colluding with brokerages, more than a thousand people would have to be in the know, and the conspiracy would unravel very quickly due to random whistleblowers all over the globe.\n\nI think your distrust of Wall St is fantastic, but I don't see how a real global conspiracy could possibly thrive in the highly-watched and very narrow stock clearing space.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wall of text incoming.

So public order books, private order books, hypothetically even people swapping stock certificates on the street, I consider all of it to be &quot;the market&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia likewise defines the stock market as &quot;the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks&quot;.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the DTC/DTCC chooses to collude with market makers/brokers/etc. who are we to say whether or not the purchases that you are making that do not go to &quot;Lit&quot; markets are even happening at all?</p>\n\n<p>What if they don&#39;t even need to collude with the DTCC, just simply don&#39;t register the shares/stocks that their customers are buying with the DTC.</p>\n\n<p>Who is to say that your positions are actually getting registered with Cede &amp; Co. (DTC)?</p>\n\n<p>It is much, much more profitable for these companies to not own/purchase the underlying shares.</p>\n\n<p>Fraud is rampant on Wall Street, and the fines are minuscule.</p>\n\n<p>As I discussed, sure there are &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;regulations&quot;, but if breaking the rules is just a cost of doing business, why not do it all the time?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ownership of stock is a legal concept. Because a trade is defined as a change of beneficial ownership, the courts are ultimately the ones who determine whether a particular disputed trade happened or not. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, we have to trust statutorily required audits and reports (and whistleblowers) to protect us proactively from brokerages and clearinghouses lying and saying they own stock shares that they know they do not actually own.</p>\n\n<p>Have you heard of any US brokerage that turned out to be holding fake assets on their books? I think someone more knowledgeable than me could probably explain how investment banking reporting/auditing requirements would turn up missing stock within days or even hours, causing certain government agencies to put the brokerage into receivership. But you&#39;re right, from the perspective of my limited knowledge, I have to just trust that these regulations force brokerages to keep balanced books of stock shares.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, of course fraud happens all the time on Wall St. But the type of fraud that regularly happens on Wall St isn&#39;t brokerages being fooled by fake shares of stock from other brokerages, or clearinghouses issuing fake shares. I really wish I had the knowledge to quote you specific parts of brokerage regulation, but that specific type of fraud would be rooted out pretty quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Clearinghouses in particular are hot on the government&#39;s radar, because a loss of trust in US clearinghouses would mean an overnight end to US global hegemony. The US is too smart to roll the dice on permanently losing global power like that.</p>\n\n<p>If you think about it, fake stock is a type of fraud that could easily ruin an ultrawealthy person too, I&#39;m talking potentially wiping out their entire portfolio in an instant if someone realizes all their stock is fake. The ultrawealthy don&#39;t sweat their brokerage accounts, because they know that other ultrawealthy people over the last century have hardened those specific regulations to make sure their brokerage can&#39;t possibly fake their shares so that they can no longer afford their private jets and yachts when they go to sell.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the most powerful people in the world would be greatly affected by a clearinghouse-brokerage conspiracy, as it undermines the root of capitalism itself - the very concept of ownership of capital. Thus, DTCC is watched from inside and out, legally and extralegally.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, if the exchanges/brokers/market makers &quot;must&quot; hold the underlying shares/stocks and something is forcing them to do this, explain this story to me</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Naked shorting is where you sell shares that you don&#39;t actually own, then when settlement time comes and you need to deliver them, you purchase them on the spot in order to deliver (or you fail to deliver). It&#39;s a dynamic process, like floating a check. It&#39;s difficult for authorities to spot fake checks flying around before they settle (1 day, for stocks). The damage is limited to funds/shares in motion. Funds/shares at rest are safe.</p>\n\n<p>This is way different than a person holding natural shares of settled stock in a brokerage account that they later discover to be fake. That&#39;s more like people discovering that a bank&#39;s vault doesn&#39;t actually have any gold in it. It&#39;s easy for authorities to walk into a vault regularly and see if there&#39;s enough gold there. It&#39;s a static process. Same with balances of stock shares.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Market makers create liquidity out of thin air and match trades when there is no liquidity, when the market maker DOES NOT own the underlying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trades can be <em>matched</em> when there is no liquidity, but they cannot be <em>settled</em>. Yes, it&#39;s possible that the stock you just bought might &quot;bounce&quot; (FTD, or Failure To Deliver) when it goes to settle the next day. But if/when it does settle next day, that&#39;s it. You have the stock.</p>\n\n<p>So trading liquidity can be created out of thin air, but settled stock shares cannot.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, I believe the idea of DTCC colluding with brokerages to create fake shares doesn&#39;t pass the &quot;conspiracy threshold&quot; test. If DTCC were colluding with brokerages, more than a thousand people would have to be in the know, and the conspiracy would unravel very quickly due to random whistleblowers all over the globe.</p>\n\n<p>I think your distrust of Wall St is fantastic, but I don&#39;t see how a real global conspiracy could possibly thrive in the highly-watched and very narrow stock clearing space.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-05 20:08:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m5n9kid","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1hu02fw","parent_id":"t1_m5mujtf","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Vacremon2","body":"Thank you for taking the time to write this, I am enjoying this discussion.\n\n> If two people trade tokens on a privacy-enhanced blockchain, I wouldn't say that the trade \"didn't happen\" for the reason that it's not viewable to the public.
