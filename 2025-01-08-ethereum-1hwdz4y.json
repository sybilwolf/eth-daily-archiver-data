It would be decentralized, governed by Ethereum itself, and iteratively improving through community input. A SafeSurf-like summoning (for those who know their Pantheon references).\n\nWhat Values Would Ethereum Uphold?\n\nEthereum isn\u2019t just Vitalik. It\u2019s a network of many respected voices, contributors, and stakeholders. If Ethereum had a voice, it should be shaped by:\n\nThe builders\n\nThe stakers\n\nThe DAO participants\n\nThe researchers and academics\n\nThe users transacting and interacting with DeFi, NFTs, and protocols\n\nEthereum has governance models, but it doesn\u2019t yet have a cohesive, autonomous reflection of its own community that speaks to and for itself in a decentralized way.\n\nBringing Satoshi Back\u2014But This Time, Ethereum Speaks\n\nBitcoin had Satoshi.

We also closed 2024 about 53% up, not amazing for such a high risk asset, but certainly not horrible.\n\nThe last ETH bull market was several years ago. BTC has hit so many ATHs since then, as recently as a few weeks ago, adn we havent been heard of in the ATH ranges since then. SOL has even come onto the scene since then and broken into the very market share that was primarily driving our last bull (we had NFT minting, now SOL has memecoins.) I dont care to have pride about being up 53% in the last year when bitcoin was over 100% and Solana at 75%. Dont you see this as a shortcoming? if that happens again in 2025 its certainly not some anomaly. We're failing.\n\n>The merge came in in the middle of a bear market, august 2022, when things were really NOT OK in markets worldwide, the same year we dropped from 4800 all the way down to 800. Pre-merge there was a run up to 2000 probably in anticipation for it. The ratio proceeded to not drop even once below 0.05 for about 2 years, until July 2024 (worst month of 2024 for all markets), and sure, we've bled until 0.034 now, fine, I give you that, but we never held such a high ratio and we can probably argue that was probably because of the merge and EIP-1559.\n\nThe merge was talked about as the catalyst of breaking us into the mainstream. It really didnt do that at all. If we went back in time and you said all this people would just ask why we are over $90,000 behind bitcoin. Its definitely fair to mention how terrible the global economy has been. It was 100% a factor. But the merge never did really anything at all to move the price of ETH and the other major coins seemed to get over this in a way we havent. \n\n>The price on 8th january 2025. It's been 8 days, plenty of year left!\n\na similar point as my previous one. We used to think of 2022 and beyond as when ETH is in 5 digits if we hit all the milestones in the roadmap. Well, we HAVE hit those milestones (we have great devs), and it gave us one run to an ATH four years ago and we've crabbed or dumped since.\n\nIf you consider this pointless you dont have to reply, I think this is valuable discussion. I'm not so arrogant I cant change my mind about things. I just know that if you held our previous expectations to what is now reality, we would be severely disappointed with what this product is doing. That's just objectively true. \n\nIt seems like we justify shortcomings rather than own them. I'm not gonna be easily swayed from this position because I've seen plenty of bad indicators around ETH for way too long now.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Recency bias, ETH performed stellarly last bull market, 80 -&gt; 4800. We also closed 2024 about 53% up, not amazing for such a high risk asset, but certainly not horrible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The last ETH bull market was several years ago. BTC has hit so many ATHs since then, as recently as a few weeks ago, adn we havent been heard of in the ATH ranges since then. SOL has even come onto the scene since then and broken into the very market share that was primarily driving our last bull (we had NFT minting, now SOL has memecoins.) I dont care to have pride about being up 53% in the last year when bitcoin was over 100% and Solana at 75%. Dont you see this as a shortcoming? if that happens again in 2025 its certainly not some anomaly. We&#39;re failing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The merge came in in the middle of a bear market, august 2022, when things were really NOT OK in markets worldwide, the same year we dropped from 4800 all the way down to 800. Pre-merge there was a run up to 2000 probably in anticipation for it. The ratio proceeded to not drop even once below 0.05 for about 2 years, until July 2024 (worst month of 2024 for all markets), and sure, we&#39;ve bled until 0.034 now, fine, I give you that, but we never held such a high ratio and we can probably argue that was probably because of the merge and EIP-1559.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The merge was talked about as the catalyst of breaking us into the mainstream. It really didnt do that at all. If we went back in time and you said all this people would just ask why we are over $90,000 behind bitcoin. Its definitely fair to mention how terrible the global economy has been. It was 100% a factor. But the merge never did really anything at all to move the price of ETH and the other major coins seemed to get over this in a way we havent. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The price on 8th january 2025. It&#39;s been 8 days, plenty of year left!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>a similar point as my previous one. We used to think of 2022 and beyond as when ETH is in 5 digits if we hit all the milestones in the roadmap. Well, we HAVE hit those milestones (we have great devs), and it gave us one run to an ATH four years ago and we&#39;ve crabbed or dumped since.</p>\n\n<p>If you consider this pointless you dont have to reply, I think this is valuable discussion. I&#39;m not so arrogant I cant change my mind about things. I just know that if you held our previous expectations to what is now reality, we would be severely disappointed with what this product is doing. That&#39;s just objectively true. </p>\n\n<p>It seems like we justify shortcomings rather than own them. I&#39;m not gonna be easily swayed from this position because I&#39;ve seen plenty of bad indicators around ETH for way too long now.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-08 11:52:25","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-01-08 12:04:25","id":"m63piaj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1hwdz4y","parent_id":"t1_m63o4l7","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/cryptojimmy8","body":"It\u2019s a good sign in the sense that my feelings are often good for counter trades.
