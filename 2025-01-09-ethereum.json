It's an early example of using the same bookkeeping system we use for ownership of companies for more abstract financial intentions.\n\nThen in the 1990s Tradfi invented ETFs. These were more tax efficient than mutual funds because buyers could treat income as capital gains and redeem the shares for in-kind assets (which avoids a trade) but most importantly they were natively tradable on the stock exchange throughout the day rather than indirectly through the fund company or brokers after market close. Taxes deferred allow you to compound more money before eventually cashing out. Paying a lower tax rate effectively increases your yield compared to dividends. Fairer redemptions protects the peg and leads to a healthier asset for buyers. The benefits of these changes are undeniable and due to them ETFs have experienced explosive growth.\n\nSince their inception ETFs have been gobbling up an ever larger share of the economy. In the early 1990s at the advent of the ETF, mutual funds accounted for around 20% of the NYSE total market cap. Today, mutual funds and ETFs together account for around 40%. This is in addition to the market cap rising from 36.7% of US GDP to a staggering 208%. This shows just how much fundamental value there is to a financial wrapper around even the simplest financial intent (a basket of assets).\n\nBut the blockchain is doing much more than acting simply as a ledger at this point. It does more than transfer value; it adds value by enabling you to express financial intentions. Today you can capture financial upside from any type of price movement you like. There are ways to profit from the price going up, down, sideways, or just being volatile. Defi has already rebuilt most of Tradfi on more technically sound infrastructure backed by more math and less counterparties. This covers everything from [decentralized exchanges](https://defillama.com/dexs), to [rate-stripping protocols](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/rate-speculation-platforms), to options protocols and even some entirely new things like [prediction markets](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/11/09/infofinance.html), [leveraged carry trades](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harvesting-interest-rate-spreads), and a fully [internet native bond](https://mirror.xyz/0xF99d0E4E3435cc9C9868D1C6274DfaB3e2721341/v_ksCJPHOLFOtXB47ng7cdYnFiVOq2pw22clQJq8weU).\n\nWrapping these financial intents in tokens offers the same benefits ETFs brought to the stock market but once you combine those benefits with the power of finalization you achieve self-compounding, yield-bearing, leveraged strategies underpinning the token that anyone, anywhere in the world can access with nothing more than a swap or deposit. You no longer have to resort to something like [this](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-double-logris). Uniswap v1 didn't return a token.

The speakers at the conference discussed various aspects of EVM improvements, including the introduction of new proposals such as EVM Max and the upcoming implementation of EIP 1559. They highlighted the importance of enhancing the EVM for scalability and performance, considering factors like developer experience, standardization initiatives for Layer 2 optimizations, and the role of alternative languages in bringing new functionalities to Ethereum. Discussions also covered the potential impact of introducing EVM Common Core for Layer 2 compatibility and the challenges of coordinating modifications across different chains.

The speakers at the conference discussed various aspects of EVM improvements, including the introduction of new proposals such as EVM Max and the upcoming implementation of EIP 1559. They highlighted the importance of enhancing the EVM for scalability and performance, considering factors like developer experience, standardization initiatives for Layer 2 optimizations, and the role of alternative languages in bringing new functionalities to Ethereum. Discussions also covered the potential impact of introducing EVM Common Core for Layer 2 compatibility and the challenges of coordinating modifications across different chains. Additionally, the panel addressed concerns about maintaining compatibility and pushing for innovation in the Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems.</p>\n\n<h2>Discussion Questions:</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>How do you think the proposed EVM improvements such as EVM Max and EIP 1559 will shape the future of Ethereum in terms of scalability and performance, and what challenges might arise in their implementation?</p></li>\n<li><p>In what ways do you see alternative languages playing a crucial role in expanding the functionalities of Ethereum, and how can developers navigate the complexities of coordinating modifications across various chains while maintaining compatibility and fostering innovation in Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Your mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

But isn\u2019t ETH supposed to outperform BTC in <em>bull runs</em>, just like before??Newsflash: this time is different. Completely different.</p>\n\n<p>Now if you are trading against USD then I guess you\u2019re a bit happier, but imo it\u2019s concerning that BTC and many alts have put in a new USD highs while ETH bleeds out on every pump and dump. And don\u2019t tell me the ratio doesn\u2019t matter because it absolutely does. Why would anyone hold an asset as risky as ETH when they could just hold BTC instead for far less risk?</p>\n\n<p>I would love to hear a good explanation for this beyond but still haven\u2019t gotten one. It\u2019s so bizarre because Ethereum clearly has been growing in usage by all metrics\u2026yet that growth is not turning into price appreciation for ETH.</p>\n\n<p>Is it the lack of a clear narrative? Broken tokenomics? Is it the low staking APY? The staking carry trade? The lack of revenue on the L1 because of L2s? The EF?</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate a thoughtful response instead of attacks.
