Uncommon Core 2.0 - Ethereum and Solana - MEV and Beyond**](https://www.ucc2.xyz/podcast/episode/e34d2307/ethereum-and-solana-mev-and-beyond)\n\nIn this episode Hasu and Jon Charb talk with Robert Miller from Flashbots about MEV, but also L1 design in general. To understand the conversation I guess some knowledge about MEV is needed, but even if you are not too technical the episode is pretty good. Why?\n\nFirst of all it is a pretty good summary of the current state of MEV, both on ETH, but also with regards to Solana and L2s. Robert Miller shares some of the things the Flashbots team has been working on like buildernet. On top there were two \"highlights\" for me. \n\n1. Maybe you remember Max Resnick pushing MPC (Multi Concurrent Proposers) as \"the only solution\" (not verbatim) to censorship resistance. Robert Miller explains in great detail why he believes that there are more solutions to the problem. What I liked the most is that he gave me great confidence that \"Ethereum\" (both EF researchers, but also separate teams like the Flashbots guys) is not just aware of the problem and the different options, but has been thinking and working on a solution for a long time. To me that's just more evidence that Ethereum is years ahead with regards to research. \"Ethereum\" (unlike Max Resnick) might not be talking about it all the time, but there are plans and there's progress. \n\n2. While talking about MEV in Solana Jon Charb basically says that \"Solana is aware of the centralizing forces of MEV on the validator level\" but are gathering data and working on it to estimate the impact MEV has. Hasu (and Robert to a certain extent) is more or less politely dunking on Jon Charb saying that this looks like a big problem that Solana is not really tackling with one validator exploiting the whole chain because social pressure isn't working anymore - and Jon agrees. Despite being co-hosts Hasu is one of the few really challenging Jon's Solana bias, which I think was really interesting. Again, he's doing it in a nice way, but I still felt that Jon's position was questioned *and* corrected in realtime, something I would like to see more. \n\n[**2. Into the Bytecode - Jake Chervinsky on regulations from first principles**](https://www.intothebytecode.com/47-jake-chervinsky/)\n\nInto the Bytecode is usually a very technical podcast. This episode is about the regulatory landscape (focus on the US) and how Jake Chervinsky expects things to change in the coming months. \n\nI like this episode because Jake is a great guest who takes a lot of time and thought to answer the questions. Also because the discussion is structured very well, the episode is flowing and topics are perfectly connected. \n\nIt's a great overview about \"governance\", both from a nation state point of view (again: focussing on the US), but also governance in crypto.

Uncommon Core 2.0 - Ethereum and Solana - MEV and Beyond</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>In this episode Hasu and Jon Charb talk with Robert Miller from Flashbots about MEV, but also L1 design in general. To understand the conversation I guess some knowledge about MEV is needed, but even if you are not too technical the episode is pretty good. Why?</p>\n\n<p>First of all it is a pretty good summary of the current state of MEV, both on ETH, but also with regards to Solana and L2s. Robert Miller shares some of the things the Flashbots team has been working on like buildernet. On top there were two &quot;highlights&quot; for me. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Maybe you remember Max Resnick pushing MPC (Multi Concurrent Proposers) as &quot;the only solution&quot; (not verbatim) to censorship resistance. Robert Miller explains in great detail why he believes that there are more solutions to the problem. What I liked the most is that he gave me great confidence that &quot;Ethereum&quot; (both EF researchers, but also separate teams like the Flashbots guys) is not just aware of the problem and the different options, but has been thinking and working on a solution for a long time. To me that&#39;s just more evidence that Ethereum is years ahead with regards to research. &quot;Ethereum&quot; (unlike Max Resnick) might not be talking about it all the time, but there are plans and there&#39;s progress. </p></li>\n<li><p>While talking about MEV in Solana Jon Charb basically says that &quot;Solana is aware of the centralizing forces of MEV on the validator level&quot; but are gathering data and working on it to estimate the impact MEV has. Hasu (and Robert to a certain extent) is more or less politely dunking on Jon Charb saying that this looks like a big problem that Solana is not really tackling with one validator exploiting the whole chain because social pressure isn&#39;t working anymore - and Jon agrees. Despite being co-hosts Hasu is one of the few really challenging Jon&#39;s Solana bias, which I think was really interesting. Again, he&#39;s doing it in a nice way, but I still felt that Jon&#39;s position was questioned <em>and</em> corrected in realtime, something I would like to see more. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.intothebytecode.com/47-jake-chervinsky/\"><strong>2.

By engaging in open dialogue, using pro-social media platforms, and promoting collaborative decision-making, Taiwan was able to increase public trust from 9% to over 70%. The talk emphasized the importance of turning conflict into co-creation, reducing polarization through informed consensus, and designing systems that enhance relationships and connections among individuals. Additionally, strategies to counter threats from state actors included fostering community organization, trust-building, and grassroots involvement to prevent societal polarization and subversion.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can the strategies used by Taiwan to rebuild public trust and counter threats from state actors be applied to other countries or communities facing similar challenges?\n\n- In what ways can the principles of turning conflict into co-creation and promoting collaborative decision-making be implemented in organizations or governments to build stronger relationships and foster trust among individuals?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
