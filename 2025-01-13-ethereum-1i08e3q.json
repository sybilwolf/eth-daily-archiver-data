You're just not using mainnet which isn't really an issue if the L2 is quite secure, since you then inherit the security of Ethereum. The upside is great UX and low cost of transacting, the downside is fragmented liquidity, which is already not a problem on the biggest L2s.\n\n>I have issues with Solana, but I think people experience how the UX and fees are on L1's like that and others like say SUI and see how much it better it can be and start to see Ethereum as outdated and no longer interesting. These just feel like such an upgrade over the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nHow are these alt L1s achieving such improvements? Unless they have discovered magic algorithms to compress and store data, they are probably doing the same thing as Ethereum. The main issue is that having a very fast L1 implies higher requirements to run a node (hardware, fixable if you have money, and infrastructure for example internet speed, not fixable even with money).\n\nSome personal experience running nodes (data might be slightly incorrect).\n\nEthereum mainnet is very easy to run, you can be a validator with a basic computer and connection and a 2TB ssd.\n\nLet's move on to Arbitrum (which would be comparable to a fast L1 in requirements), mostly basic hardware and connection, 4TB ssd.\n\nThe state growth of Arbitrum has increased dramatically since the blobs update made it cheaper to transact. I could manage to run it on a 2-3TB ssd, now 4TB almost gets full after months without pruning (after pruning it's around 1.5-2TB right now).\n\nNow imagine running a node for a monolithic L1 that does the same transaction volume as all Ethereum + L2s (or more, Ethereum's vision is certainly not done). That would require at least 8TB with constant pruning, soon after 12TB and 16TB, hardware and connection are also going to be more stressed.

You&#39;re just not using mainnet which isn&#39;t really an issue if the L2 is quite secure, since you then inherit the security of Ethereum. The upside is great UX and low cost of transacting, the downside is fragmented liquidity, which is already not a problem on the biggest L2s.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have issues with Solana, but I think people experience how the UX and fees are on L1&#39;s like that and others like say SUI and see how much it better it can be and start to see Ethereum as outdated and no longer interesting. These just feel like such an upgrade over the Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How are these alt L1s achieving such improvements? Unless they have discovered magic algorithms to compress and store data, they are probably doing the same thing as Ethereum. The main issue is that having a very fast L1 implies higher requirements to run a node (hardware, fixable if you have money, and infrastructure for example internet speed, not fixable even with money).</p>\n\n<p>Some personal experience running nodes (data might be slightly incorrect).</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum mainnet is very easy to run, you can be a validator with a basic computer and connection and a 2TB ssd.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s move on to Arbitrum (which would be comparable to a fast L1 in requirements), mostly basic hardware and connection, 4TB ssd.</p>\n\n<p>The state growth of Arbitrum has increased dramatically since the blobs update made it cheaper to transact.

The speakers highlighted the importance of conducting user interviews and usability testing to understand user needs, behaviors, and pain points. They emphasized the need to find the right users for research based on specific criteria related to the project goals.\n\n\n\nThe participants engaged in group exercises to create research plans for various projects, including designing a decentralized learning management system, developing a game, and improving a setup wizard for a web 3 game. The discussions revealed valuable insights such as the importance of clear animations for fingerprint sensors, considering various user motivations, prioritizing usability testing tasks, and addressing technical challenges. The speakers also provided guidance on recruiting participants, obtaining consent, and compensating research participants, stressing the importance of keeping user research focused on the project goals.\n\nThe speaker acknowledged that starting with intense tasks may not be the best approach. As the session was about to end, the audience was encouraged to ask quick questions, but one participant presented a complex issue about targeting specific user sectors in product development, which was considered not suited for a quick answer within the remaining time. The audience was informed that questions could be discussed outside the classroom after the session.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nHow can project teams effectively balance the need for in-depth user research with the constraints of project timelines and resources in the development of web 3 technologies?\n\n\n\nIn what ways can the insights gained from user research and usability testing in web 3 technologies inform the design and development of decentralized applications to better meet user needs and improve overall user experiences?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

The speakers also provided guidance on recruiting participants, obtaining consent, and compensating research participants, stressing the importance of keeping user research focused on the project goals.</p>\n\n<p>The speaker acknowledged that starting with intense tasks may not be the best approach. As the session was about to end, the audience was encouraged to ask quick questions, but one participant presented a complex issue about targeting specific user sectors in product development, which was considered not suited for a quick answer within the remaining time. The audience was informed that questions could be discussed outside the classroom after the session.</p>\n\n<h2>Discussion Questions:</h2>\n\n<p>How can project teams effectively balance the need for in-depth user research with the constraints of project timelines and resources in the development of web 3 technologies?</p>\n\n<p>In what ways can the insights gained from user research and usability testing in web 3 technologies inform the design and development of decentralized applications to better meet user needs and improve overall user experiences?</p>\n\n<p>Your mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments. The primary goal here is community development through education.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hzh55o/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2025/m6q7u8a/\">Yesterday&#39;s discussion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hanniabu/devcon-7-videos/blob/main/videos.md\">All DevCon talks ranked by views</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h0xkvx/daily_general_discussion_november_27_2024/lz8b95w/\">The grand idea</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><sup>The</sup> <sup>summary</sup> <sup>and</sup> <sup>discussion</sup> <sup>questions</sup> <sup>are</sup> <sup>AI-generated</sup> <sup>from</sup> <sup>Youtube&#39;s</sup> <sup>autogenerated</sup> <sup>transcript.</sup> <sup>The</sup> <sup>transcript</sup> <sup>may</sup> <sup>capture</sup> <sup>some</sup> <sup>names</sup> <sup>and</sup> <sup>terms</sup> <sup>incorrectly.</sup></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-13 03:02:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m6wicm7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i08e3q","parent_id":"t3_1i08e3q","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"And 3k is gone now too.. this is getting ugly :( here I was hoping for the narrative that January would go up up.
