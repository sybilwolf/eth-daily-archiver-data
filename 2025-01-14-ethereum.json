Apparently they have the possibility to limit activities of certain addresses by not forwarding RPC calls, not showing stuff on their block explorer and exclude certain things form wallets. The first two are clear. Similar things happened with infura and block explorers are hiding scam tokens to improve the usability. The third point about 'excluded from wallets' is a bit mysterious, but I guess this can only be done if soneium has their own wallets, otherwise it is just a consequence of not answerinf RPC calls for certain addresses.\n\nOne of the first victims seems to be a token called aibo, named after a robot dog made by sony. They got blacklisted and trading volume went to close 0. I guess sony did not like having their trademarked name as a meme token on the chain. I guess if this is just RPC level blockings one can easily circumvent it by running their own soneium node. No idea if it is currently possible. I guess also third party RPC providers might be possible. I guess that is why there still is a very small volume of this token trading.\n\nI am not sure if the interpretation is correct, but it seems like Sony is willing to neuter their soneium chain to protect their trademarks.

Apparently they have the possibility to limit activities of certain addresses by not forwarding RPC calls, not showing stuff on their block explorer and exclude certain things form wallets. The first two are clear. Similar things happened with infura and block explorers are hiding scam tokens to improve the usability. The third point about &#39;excluded from wallets&#39; is a bit mysterious, but I guess this can only be done if soneium has their own wallets, otherwise it is just a consequence of not answerinf RPC calls for certain addresses.</p>\n\n<p>One of the first victims seems to be a token called aibo, named after a robot dog made by sony. They got blacklisted and trading volume went to close 0. I guess sony did not like having their trademarked name as a meme token on the chain. I guess if this is just RPC level blockings one can easily circumvent it by running their own soneium node. No idea if it is currently possible.

Happy that I didn\u2019t sell my xrp over the years and it is paying off a bit now. Similarly I would never sell ETH until it is fairly valued. I thought ETH will have a new ATH in Jan if 2021 trend is related but at this point it can\u2019t happen. So started to feel what if ETH is XRP last run which just underperforms this cycle as per current trend and may be only sky rockets next cycle ? Like xrp did this cycle ? .
