I won\u2019t say anything new, it\u2019s just my story of losing trust in the company. This message turned out even more bitter than I wanted. So if you\u2019re not in a mood for reading some whining then better to skip it probably.\u00a0\n\nFirst, the data leak was outrageous. They leaked personal data of many people, including mine. I still sometimes get fishy emails and SMS that might mention my name or even my home address. Many such emails are looking trustworthy, so at some point I stopped trusting any message that mentions the word \u201cledger\u201d.\u00a0\n\nAs a result, when they announced the recover/backup feature, I literally thought that it\u2019s another attempt of someone to scam me. I didn\u2019t realize up until recently that it\u2019s the actual feature. That they have a backdoor in my device, even though I literally paid them money for the impossibility of private key extraction. How did they even dare to do such thing - get access to my precious private key and pretend like nothing happened, like they doing me a favor.\u00a0\n\nWell, I have an issue that I trust some people and companies more than they deserve. The first red flag with ledger was way earlier, just a few weeks after I bought my device. They marked my ETH address as\u00a0\u00a0legacy without properly communicating why it was required. I think there was some migration from older version of Ledger Live to the new version which considered all previously created addresses \u201clegacy\u201d for whatever reason. Yeah, that\u2019s a small thing. But honestly, when I pay money for something to be as predictable as possible, that is a big enough red flag by itself. To be fair, it didn\u2019t cause me any real issues apart from mild annoyance each time I used the device.\n\nAnd what\u2019s up with this ledger live desktop app anyways? Why it doesn\u2019t let me use my wallet without software and firmware updates? Why it forces me to install the updates? What if I want to use the old version because I lost trust (for example because of the recovery feature)?\u00a0\n\nWhy the desktop app doesn\u2019t even show the full public address when I send money? I\u2019m not joking. I used ledger live several days ago and I couldn\u2019t see last 5-6 digits of the receiver public address in the confirmation view. How did they allow that? And if I didn\u2019t miss anything, there is no way to save a list of previously used addresses. So need to triple check everything all the time. On top of that, I didn\u2019t find an option to create an address with a pass phrase (but don\u2019t take this complaint too serious, maybe I didn\u2019t search good enough. Still, I\u2019d be happy if they made the UI clearer for critical security features).\u00a0\n\nIn addition, what\u2019s that blind signing nonsense? In 2025, I still need to sign a transaction and just hope that no software does an attack or makes a mistake. Blind signing. What exactly did they do in the countless software and firmware updates? Why not to support proper signing? I guess, they spent resources on exploiting the backdoor to introduce the recovery feature.\n\nAnd to end my rant, I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m deeply displeased with the screen going darker and darker. At first I thought that I\u2019m seeing things, but then I saw that many people have the same problem. Ledger not only managed to lose my trust by breaking key promises, but they also made a bad device from hardware perspective. I didn\u2019t use it that much, so it happened pretty much by itself just sitting on the shelf turned off.\u00a0\n\nPhew. Sorry for the long rant, it kinda accumulated over the years. I\u2019ve migrated to Trezor, and I hope that they won\u2019t make critical mistakes in the upcoming years. All I need is my cold wallet to be exactly the same in 10 years. Please, no stupid updates just for the sake of it. I don\u2019t need features, I just need it to be simple, reliable and trustworthy.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to complain about ledger and share my thoughts on it.

In 2025, I still need to sign a transaction and just hope that no software does an attack or makes a mistake. Blind signing. What exactly did they do in the countless software and firmware updates? Why not to support proper signing? I guess, they spent resources on exploiting the backdoor to introduce the recovery feature.</p>\n\n<p>And to end my rant, I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m deeply displeased with the screen going darker and darker. At first I thought that I\u2019m seeing things, but then I saw that many people have the same problem. Ledger not only managed to lose my trust by breaking key promises, but they also made a bad device from hardware perspective. I didn\u2019t use it that much, so it happened pretty much by itself just sitting on the shelf turned off.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Phew. Sorry for the long rant, it kinda accumulated over the years. I\u2019ve migrated to Trezor, and I hope that they won\u2019t make critical mistakes in the upcoming years. All I need is my cold wallet to be exactly the same in 10 years. Please, no stupid updates just for the sake of it. I don\u2019t need features, I just need it to be simple, reliable and trustworthy.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-15 11:19:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7bkm1x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i1rwrc","parent_id":"t3_1i1rwrc","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Belligerent_Chocobo","body":"Yeah it's just been a steady drip drip of disappointment with them.

I ended up getting work with a local NZ project and also just now looks like I will be doing 2 days/week with KarmaGAP which is super exciting! Plus I&#39;m still in the South Island right now touring in my van a bit making the most of the summer so I&#39;ve been pretty busy.

I&#39;ve been here since early 2017 and it&#39;s always the same, if the price doesn&#39;t go up fast as shit, the asset sucks and it will never go up.
