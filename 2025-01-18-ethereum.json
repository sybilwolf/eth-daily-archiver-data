I wanted to pop in today to share a few thoughts.\n\nI'm encouraged by Vitalik's post (https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1880635379771904423) suggesting that change is coming to EF leadership. I agree with Joe Lubin's comments (https://x.com/ethereumJoseph/status/1880616193641640330) insofar as the environment has changed a lot, and EF leadership needs to evolve with it. I think Vitalik's suggestion that we bring more technically capable leadership into the Ethereum Foundation is the right move. I've made it no secret that I think Danny Ryan would be a great choice to lead the EF. Not only is he very capable technically, but he also understands the Ethereum ethos extremely well, respects its process of rough consensus, and is humble enough to engage others to support him in the areas where he may not have expertise without being threatened by them. If Danny is truly interested in such a role, then we'd be very lucky to have him. But I want to be clear that any kind of co-lead structure, or a structure which has Danny as CTO to someone else being ED would likely be counter-productive. A kitchen cannot have two head-chefs. On balance, Danny has credibility from the Community AND Core Devs. He's a logical choice and I hope Vitalik will make the right one here.\n\nAnd while I don't love the framing in the second half of Vitalik's post, I generally agree with most of it. EF should not be doing \"lobbying,\" which would involve engaging with legislators and policymakers to explicitly influence policy and legislation. However, I DO THINK that EF should not be afraid to talk to governments and businesses where appropriate to explain Ethereum's differentiated value prop and encourage them to build on it where appropriate. There is a difference between ADVOCACY & EDUCATION and LOBBYING. I hope that this is a distinction which the future EF leadership understands. And with respect to actual Lobbying, I've LOVE to see industry (apps and L2s) fund an actual Ethereum-focused lobbying org to influence in DC and beyond.\n\nI think where EF can add most value in this very competitive environment is the following:\n\n1) Enhance efforts to support technical development to ensure Ethereum remains competitive in the blockchain space. Right now, imo this means helping the community to make tough decisions about Ethereum's future in a timely manner and suggest appropriate prioritization of development. EF has always done this, but it will do it even better with deeper technical expertise at the top.\n2) Redouble advocacy efforts to ensure that the Ethereum and ETH value propositions are well understood. We've outsourced all of this to the \"podcast layer\", and imo, that's been disasterous. Communicating about what Ethereum does and what its future looks like will NOT compromise credible neutrality. We need this now more than ever.\n3) Lead by example by actively using Ethereum, and demonstrate to others how it can change the world. This means using and talking about the apps. Not acting like the app layer doesn't exist, or expressing disdain at the apps which currently exists.\n\nI think ecosystem development has come so far in the past few years that I question how much more is needed. This needs to be refocused to a handful of priorities which we feel the open market cannot address effectively. It's hard to critique current efforts here by the EF, because much of it is opaque. But i'd much rather put 10x more effort into dev and advocacy is my two cents.\n\nAs for Vitalik's other points (some sort of trolling, lol), I think the message is that EF is not going to morph into some sort of super-dominant organization. That's fine, and that's not what we need for a credibly neutral network. But I'd LOVE to see an organization focused 100% on making sure Ethereum WINS the role of becoming the world computer and settlement layer and is not passive about centralized competition running the entire narrative and adoption cycle. IMO, this means burning harder than ever before on the priorities I mentioned above and jettisoning most everything else.\n\nI hope you all are well. I'm still super optimistic about the Ethereum ecosystem, and change to the factors I mentioned above can only be a good thing!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, hope everyone here is well in this new (but old) home. I wanted to pop in today to share a few thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m encouraged by Vitalik&#39;s post (<a href=\"https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1880635379771904423\">https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1880635379771904423</a>) suggesting that change is coming to EF leadership. I agree with Joe Lubin&#39;s comments (<a href=\"https://x.com/ethereumJoseph/status/1880616193641640330\">https://x.com/ethereumJoseph/status/1880616193641640330</a>) insofar as the environment has changed a lot, and EF leadership needs to evolve with it. I think Vitalik&#39;s suggestion that we bring more technically capable leadership into the Ethereum Foundation is the right move. I&#39;ve made it no secret that I think Danny Ryan would be a great choice to lead the EF. Not only is he very capable technically, but he also understands the Ethereum ethos extremely well, respects its process of rough consensus, and is humble enough to engage others to support him in the areas where he may not have expertise without being threatened by them. If Danny is truly interested in such a role, then we&#39;d be very lucky to have him. But I want to be clear that any kind of co-lead structure, or a structure which has Danny as CTO to someone else being ED would likely be counter-productive. A kitchen cannot have two head-chefs. On balance, Danny has credibility from the Community AND Core Devs. He&#39;s a logical choice and I hope Vitalik will make the right one here.</p>\n\n<p>And while I don&#39;t love the framing in the second half of Vitalik&#39;s post, I generally agree with most of it. EF should not be doing &quot;lobbying,&quot; which would involve engaging with legislators and policymakers to explicitly influence policy and legislation. However, I DO THINK that EF should not be afraid to talk to governments and businesses where appropriate to explain Ethereum&#39;s differentiated value prop and encourage them to build on it where appropriate. There is a difference between ADVOCACY &amp; EDUCATION and LOBBYING. I hope that this is a distinction which the future EF leadership understands. And with respect to actual Lobbying, I&#39;ve LOVE to see industry (apps and L2s) fund an actual Ethereum-focused lobbying org to influence in DC and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>I think where EF can add most value in this very competitive environment is the following:</p>\n\n<p>1) Enhance efforts to support technical development to ensure Ethereum remains competitive in the blockchain space. Right now, imo this means helping the community to make tough decisions about Ethereum&#39;s future in a timely manner and suggest appropriate prioritization of development. EF has always done this, but it will do it even better with deeper technical expertise at the top.\n2) Redouble advocacy efforts to ensure that the Ethereum and ETH value propositions are well understood. We&#39;ve outsourced all of this to the &quot;podcast layer&quot;, and imo, that&#39;s been disasterous. Communicating about what Ethereum does and what its future looks like will NOT compromise credible neutrality. We need this now more than ever.\n3) Lead by example by actively using Ethereum, and demonstrate to others how it can change the world. This means using and talking about the apps. Not acting like the app layer doesn&#39;t exist, or expressing disdain at the apps which currently exists.</p>\n\n<p>I think ecosystem development has come so far in the past few years that I question how much more is needed. This needs to be refocused to a handful of priorities which we feel the open market cannot address effectively. It&#39;s hard to critique current efforts here by the EF, because much of it is opaque. But i&#39;d much rather put 10x more effort into dev and advocacy is my two cents.</p>\n\n<p>As for Vitalik&#39;s other points (some sort of trolling, lol), I think the message is that EF is not going to morph into some sort of super-dominant organization. That&#39;s fine, and that&#39;s not what we need for a credibly neutral network. But I&#39;d LOVE to see an organization focused 100% on making sure Ethereum WINS the role of becoming the world computer and settlement layer and is not passive about centralized competition running the entire narrative and adoption cycle. IMO, this means burning harder than ever before on the priorities I mentioned above and jettisoning most everything else.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you all are well. I&#39;m still super optimistic about the Ethereum ecosystem, and change to the factors I mentioned above can only be a good thing!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-18 08:31:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7tnkcv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i41zsh","parent_id":"t3_1i41zsh","score":124,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Canadiens1993","body":"Come post here most often, sir.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Come post here most often, sir.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-18 08:36:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7tojac","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i41zsh","parent_id":"t1_m7tnkcv","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/panthoreon","body":"Yeah dude we missed you in ethfinance, appreciate the input here","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah dude we missed you in ethfinance, appreciate the input here</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-18 11:01:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7uhpge","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i41zsh","parent_id":"t1_m7tojac","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/italianjob16","body":"Fully agree with you, neutrality shouldn't mean abdication.\u00a0","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Fully agree with you, neutrality shouldn&#39;t mean abdication.\u00a0</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-18 08:38:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7tp0ow","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i41zsh","parent_id":"t1_m7tnkcv","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Glad you found your way here.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Glad you found your way here.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-18 16:32:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7w8ynh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i41zsh","parent_id":"t1_m7tnkcv","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"It's been quite a while DC, nice to see you!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s been quite a while DC, nice to see you!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-18 15:08:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7vsw9o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i41zsh","parent_id":"t1_m7tnkcv","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/TheHansGruber","body":"Thank you for the thoughtful input, DC.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you for the thoughtful input, DC.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-18 10:26:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7uan9r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i41zsh","parent_id":"t1_m7tnkcv","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Thanks for stopping by DC!

Because otherwise, look at all that TVL making 3-5% APR. There&#39;s gotta be 50M ETH across Defi making at least that rate (I make more). That should easily be 2.5M ETH taken off the market every year. How are exchange reserves not bleeding out by this point?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-18 12:26:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7uxyic","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i41zsh","parent_id":"t3_1i41zsh","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Delicious-Fees1559","body":"Recommendations for ETH yields that wouldn\u2019t result in a taxable event on deposit?

Where to launch? Meanwhile other L1s are incentivizing launches and working directly with issuers to launch. There is really no quick fix for these structural issues that ETH has created for itself. </p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest loser of today is also Uniswap - apparently Solana DEXes (Jupiter and Meteora) worked directly with the presidents team to launch. What is Uniswap doing? Launched a NFT aggregator that has 5 users and is preparing to launching yet another L2... cmon. Its such a big L for uniswap that one of the biggest DEX launches in crypto ever did not use Uniswap. </p>\n\n<p>Its way more bleak than how it appears.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-18 04:26:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m7sitlu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i41zsh","parent_id":"t3_1i41zsh","score":-19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/barthib","body":"Your \"L2 fragmentation\" propaganda will not work here.
