Trump's team is building on Ethereum. And they are buying ETH at 4x the rate they are buying WBTC. But that Bitcoin is wrapped on Ethereum. And the funds to do all this buying comes from an Ethereum based fundraising campaign.\n\nTotal own goal for Saylor and the Bitcoiners to be bragging about this.
