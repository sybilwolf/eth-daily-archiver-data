Build a Large Supply of ETH While Suppressing the Price\n\t\u2022\tHow they do it:\n\t\u2022\tThey accumulate ETH through ETFs, spot purchases, or other means gradually over time.\n\t\u2022\tSimultaneously, they short ETH futures, which creates selling pressure in the futures market. This selling pressure suppresses the futures price and indirectly pulls down the spot price (via arbitrage between spot and futures markets).\n\t\u2022\tWhy this works:\n\t\u2022\tThe shorting offsets the upward pressure caused by their ETF or spot purchases. This keeps the price relatively stable or even lower than it would be without the shorting.\n\n2. Collect Profits (or Premiums) for Suppressing the Price\n\t\u2022\tHow they profit:\n\t\u2022\tWhen ETH prices drop (or fail to rise due to suppression), their futures shorts become profitable. At expiration:\n\t\u2022\tFor cash-settled futures, they collect the difference between the higher shorting price and the lower settlement price.\n\t\u2022\tFor physically settled futures, they deliver ETH (acquired at suppressed prices) at the higher futures contract price, pocketing the profit.\n\t\u2022\tWhat this means:\n\t\u2022\tThey are effectively paid for suppressing ETH prices, using their futures shorts as a tool to keep prices low while quietly accumulating ETH.\n\n3. Stop Shorting Futures (Unwind the Strategy)\n\t\u2022\tAt some point, they no longer need to suppress the price and stop shorting futures entirely:\n\t\u2022\tThey might let existing futures contracts expire without rolling the position forward.\n\t\u2022\tThis removes the artificial selling pressure in the futures market, which then allows the spot price to respond naturally to demand.\n\t\u2022\tWhy they stop shorting:\n\t\u2022\tBy this point, they\u2019ve built a large supply of ETH (via ETFs or spot purchases).\n\t\u2022\tThey\u2019re now positioned to benefit from a price spike caused by supply-demand imbalances.\n\n4. Reduced Supply + Increased Demand = Price Spike\n\t\u2022\tReduced Supply:\n\t\u2022\tThey\u2019ve accumulated a significant amount of ETH, removing it from circulation. This lowers the available supply in the market.\n\t\u2022\tIncreased Demand:\n\t\u2022\tAs demand for ETH increases (whether due to market trends, adoption, or reduced supply), prices rise naturally.\n\t\u2022\tWhy a price spike occurs:\n\t\u2022\tWith no more futures shorting suppressing the market and reduced ETH supply, the price has nothing holding it back.

This selling pressure suppresses the futures price and indirectly pulls down the spot price (via arbitrage between spot and futures markets).\n\u2022 Why this works:\n\u2022 The shorting offsets the upward pressure caused by their ETF or spot purchases. This keeps the price relatively stable or even lower than it would be without the shorting.</p></li>\n<li><p>Collect Profits (or Premiums) for Suppressing the Price\n\u2022 How they profit:\n\u2022 When ETH prices drop (or fail to rise due to suppression), their futures shorts become profitable. At expiration:\n\u2022 For cash-settled futures, they collect the difference between the higher shorting price and the lower settlement price.\n\u2022 For physically settled futures, they deliver ETH (acquired at suppressed prices) at the higher futures contract price, pocketing the profit.\n\u2022 What this means:\n\u2022 They are effectively paid for suppressing ETH prices, using their futures shorts as a tool to keep prices low while quietly accumulating ETH.</p></li>\n<li><p>Stop Shorting Futures (Unwind the Strategy)\n\u2022 At some point, they no longer need to suppress the price and stop shorting futures entirely:\n\u2022 They might let existing futures contracts expire without rolling the position forward.\n\u2022 This removes the artificial selling pressure in the futures market, which then allows the spot price to respond naturally to demand.\n\u2022 Why they stop shorting:\n\u2022 By this point, they\u2019ve built a large supply of ETH (via ETFs or spot purchases).\n\u2022 They\u2019re now positioned to benefit from a price spike caused by supply-demand imbalances.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reduced Supply + Increased Demand = Price Spike\n\u2022 Reduced Supply:\n\u2022 They\u2019ve accumulated a significant amount of ETH, removing it from circulation. This lowers the available supply in the market.\n\u2022 Increased Demand:\n\u2022 As demand for ETH increases (whether due to market trends, adoption, or reduced supply), prices rise naturally.\n\u2022 Why a price spike occurs:\n\u2022 With no more futures shorting suppressing the market and reduced ETH supply, the price has nothing holding it back.

During Suppression:\n    \u2022 They build a large ETH position (via ETFs or spot purchases).\n    \u2022 Futures shorts profit while keeping prices low.\n    2.  After Suppression:\n    \u2022 They unwind their futures shorts.\n    \u2022 Their accumulated ETH gains value as prices rise.\n    \u2022 The scarcity of ETH in the market exacerbates the price spike, amplifying their profits.</p>\n\n<p>Why This Strategy is Attractive\n    \u2022 Double Profits: They earn money both from suppressing the price (via futures shorts) and from the eventual price spike (via accumulated ETH).\n    \u2022 Market Control: They effectively control ETH\u2019s price dynamics for a time, giving them a strategic advantage over smaller market participants.\n    \u2022 Timing: By carefully choosing when to stop suppressing, they can time their gains for maximum impact, such as during a bull market or institutional demand surge.</p>\n\n<p>Risks of This Strategy\n    1.
