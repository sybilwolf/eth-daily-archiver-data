I learned some things from working at a startup and some things dawned on me very recently (cause denial). I am going to get real negative for a second:\n\n1. VCs are not friends of crypto. Behind talk of ideology and decentralization is good old-fashioned greed. They talk big talk but behind the scenes its: \"Create a token, go on twitter\", does not matter if it kills the project roadmap. Would not be surprised if crypto has struggled to find product-market fit largely because of VCs. They chase hype and quick returns and they put shackles on you and make you dance. This seems to apply to whole VC class. \"Disrupting\" means replacing a fairly decentralized industry (however flawed) with a single monopoly of which they will be a shareholder, that's the VC wet dream.\n\n2. It is a cliche to say \"corporations are greedy\" but that it is a structural problem dawned on me only now that I am about to turn 40. Enshitification and shareholder enrichment at any cost is built into the corporate structure. In the digital world that took on a whole new form - two or three companies own our digital lives, our identity, our data and control what we watch, read and buy through algorithms they themselves cannot control while enriching a Zuck and an Elon and a Jeff. (I love the book \"Technofeudalism\" on the topic). As I heard somebody say \"corporation was invented centuries ago and no new legal structures have appeared since then\".\n\n3. War and imperialism are back full swing. (Greenland!? You must be shitting me!)\n\nNow, all of that has come to have one name to me - centralization, centralization of power, centralization of wealth. Monopoly is a centralizing force, so is imperialism, so is VC money. What crypto on the other hand has done is bring back the idea that individuals matter, that we are disempowered by centralization and we have had enough. DAOs are hard to run but the exhilaration of mattering for a second felt by everybody involved in one is palpable (at least while the going is good). This is not a new thing - farm development and electrification of the USA, for example, was largely done by cooperatives. The economies of whole regions of Spain are driven by coops. The ideas of radical decentralization are not new but crypto ethos has given them new momentum among the wider public.\n\nSo why am I demoralized? It feels like the world is in a dead end and it is harder than ever to sell oneself to a Zuck-wannabe. It all seems to miss the point, it is centralization and enrichment at the cost of me and you and everybody we know.\n\nWhy am I hopeful? The space of imagining new ways to raise funds and organize seems to be thriving. Crypto is the only space in my life where the word \"governance\" and its importance seems to be universally understood. Among the decentralization theater there are genuine actors every day pulling in the right direction. So my praise goes out to everybody who has been working on decentralized networks, the Vitaliks, the people at Ethereum Foundation, the people who are coming up with new ways of funding the commons, the Owockis, the breadchains, and mastodons and blueskies (both decentralized protocols), people doing research on governance and implementing it, anybody who ever was or wanted to be a part of a DAO or a coop, anybody who believes and hopes that we do and will matter.\n\n(And thanks to the mods for everything.
