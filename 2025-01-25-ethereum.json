Not sure if it is 100% correct, especially about the zero knowledge cryptography part, but that is how I understand it at the moment:\n\nzk rollups are a huge design space and depending on the choices the costs will differ. First of all if one uses STARKS instead of SNARKS the proofs are larger, so they cost more to verify, but they are faster to generate. As far as I understand most/all non privacy zk rollups are looking into STARKS nowadays if they are not using them already. Scroll still uses SNARKS as far as I know. There is also the subspectrum of commitment schemes which change the size and growth of proofs.\n\nAnother axis is how compatible the zk rollups are to the EVM. Starknet is totally incompatible. They use their own programming language, their own wallets, their own block explorers their own...everything. This makes their network a bit of a pain to use, but their proofing is more efficient and therefore cheaper. Scroll is the other extreme, it is fully EVM compatible. Whatever smart contract runs on Ethereum runs exactly the same on scroll. This increases the proofing cost for them. Same with Linea. ZKsync is somewhere in between as it is mostly compatible, but as far as I remember the hash function is a different one which, for example, does not allow us deploy a gnosis safe on zksync under the same address as on all fully EVM compatible rollups. \n\nThere is also the part about how efficiently transaction data or state diffs are stored in blobs. So depending how advanced they are there rollups could save some money in that part as well.\n\nThere is also the obvious part if a network wants to subsidize transactions by making them cheaper to increase the usage. This is obviously totally intransparent. \n\nWhat I expect is the largest influence though is how often proofs are published to Ethereum mainnet. According to L2Beat on the 'Finality' page it takes 12 hours on starknet for a transaction to get included on Ethereum mainnet. For ZKsync it takes 4 hours and for scroll it takes 15 minutes. Publishing more proofs and batches makes a single transaction much more expensive because the proofing cost is shared among fewer transactions, but makes the time to finality much faster. So, I guess scroll is optimizing for finality and, whereas the other ones optimize for cheap transactions.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here is my understanding of it.

This makes their network a bit of a pain to use, but their proofing is more efficient and therefore cheaper. Scroll is the other extreme, it is fully EVM compatible. Whatever smart contract runs on Ethereum runs exactly the same on scroll. This increases the proofing cost for them. Same with Linea. ZKsync is somewhere in between as it is mostly compatible, but as far as I remember the hash function is a different one which, for example, does not allow us deploy a gnosis safe on zksync under the same address as on all fully EVM compatible rollups. </p>\n\n<p>There is also the part about how efficiently transaction data or state diffs are stored in blobs. So depending how advanced they are there rollups could save some money in that part as well.</p>\n\n<p>There is also the obvious part if a network wants to subsidize transactions by making them cheaper to increase the usage. This is obviously totally intransparent. </p>\n\n<p>What I expect is the largest influence though is how often proofs are published to Ethereum mainnet. According to L2Beat on the &#39;Finality&#39; page it takes 12 hours on starknet for a transaction to get included on Ethereum mainnet. For ZKsync it takes 4 hours and for scroll it takes 15 minutes. Publishing more proofs and batches makes a single transaction much more expensive because the proofing cost is shared among fewer transactions, but makes the time to finality much faster. So, I guess scroll is optimizing for finality and, whereas the other ones optimize for cheap transactions.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-25 12:15:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m95c2kl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i9hfml","parent_id":"t1_m92lyk1","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Wootnasty","body":"The actual cost of transacting is proprietary on a roll-up.

Influence actually seems to attract &quot;regular&quot; gamers (i.e. non-crypto) really well, like incredibly well, but due to the less-than-ideal onramps available on Starknet, we lose nearly all of them when they try to purchase the starter pack + SWAY required to start playing. But we&#39;re working on that with a couple partners, they&#39;re just unfortunately slow (hard to blame them considering Starknet&#39;s volume doesn&#39;t make them super attractive as a priority).</p>\n\n<p>I hope over the next few months we can resolve almost all these issues and come back really strong, but I also hope Starknet itself can make some progress in that time. It really is an incredibly solid tech stack, but of course that doesn&#39;t mean much without people to use it!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-25 08:42:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m9440ih","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i9hfml","parent_id":"t1_m9356o5","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/hblask","body":"This is always a problem with these types of game -- the problem of what happens if you go away for a bit.
