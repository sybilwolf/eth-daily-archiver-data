They highlighted the inefficiencies and risks of current KYC processes involving document sharing, emphasizing the need for a more secure and privacy-focused approach. ZK Passport enables selective disclosure of identity information through zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring privacy and security while verifying user credentials. They also presented ZK Passport's integration into a wallet called Obsidian on the Aztec Network for private and compliant transactions. The developers showcased the ZK Passport app, demonstrating how users can interact with the technology to prove specific credentials without sharing sensitive data. Additionally, they addressed UX challenges in gaining user trust and emphasized open-source practices to build credibility.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How could the implementation of ZK Passport revolutionize the current KYC processes in online identity verification and what potential impact could it have on user privacy and security?\n\n- In what ways does the integration of ZK Passport into a wallet like Obsidian on the Aztec Network demonstrate the possibilities for private and compliant transactions in the blockchain space, and what are the key challenges that need to be addressed for widespread adoption?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

Many won&#39;t. I&#39;ve been there myself. Made it to 7 figures and lost it <em>all</em> in a margin call. Couldn&#39;t even pay the rent for next month. It was <em>all</em> in crypto in a highly leveraged position. Luckily, I <em>did</em> learn my lesSsons and now avoid leverage almost completely. Crypto is volatile enough on its own. </p>\n\n<p>Do not defer <em>understanding</em> to others.</p>\n\n<p>Build your own understanding, or get abused by those that <em>do</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So what to invest in? What coin to buy? Your own mind, your own understanding. Educate yourself. It&#39;s time well spent. And time, is much more valuable than any currency. It can&#39;t be bought or traded, so spend it wisely.</p>\n\n<p>And if you made it all the way here, then I effectively <em>stole</em> some of your attention/time, so, be mindful of what catches and holds your attention. Don&#39;t let fear be your ruler. How? Create a meditation practice/ritual for yourself where you spend time staying out of <em>all thoughts</em>. It&#39;s perhaps the best <em>investment</em> in yourSelf.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for coming to my Ted talk :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-28 04:15:46","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-01-28 04:50:15","id":"m9mh8d7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ibvxys","parent_id":"t3_1ibvxys","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/aaj094","body":"It seems like the market wants either the asset considered the safest in the space or the ones where number go up fast.
