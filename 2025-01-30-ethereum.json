The proof generation will introduce some latency into the chain, so ideally it should be much faster than the slot times. </p>\n\n<p>But the important part is, even though GPUs or asics might be coming back they will have a very different role in the network than during the POW era and therefore very low centralization and energy consumption implications for the network as a whole. </p>\n\n<p>In my understanding current ZK proof implementations will increase CPU and especially RAM demand for validators a bit and that is why the current recommended specs rework talks about faster CPUs and higher RAM recommendations: <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@kevaundray/S1hUQuV4Jx\">https://hackmd.io/@kevaundray/S1hUQuV4Jx</a> . We will see if the proof validation resource demand will come down similarly like the proof generation and in the end we can validate the chain on resource efficient boards again. </p>\n\n<p>I am not sure how we will solve state growth in a highly scaled L1 world. Probably state expiry and not needing to store the transaction history due to zk proofs will help a lot.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-30 02:29:25","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-01-30 02:44:13","id":"m9zlh8e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1idh7b8","parent_id":"t1_m9zfiho","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/rhythm_of_eth","body":"What I understand, and this is likely wrong, is that there is a proof generation component now added to the chain. \n\nWho runs the proof generation, under which economic incentives and how can this stay away from PoW mining solutions is my main concern. \n\nIf we depend on proof generation that can become a centralization vector, one that has a higher bar for entry in terms of HW.\n\nThat is in essence my concern.

How many years ahead could we know of this happening and how many years do we need for the transition to a quantum secure Ethereum L1. \n\n- Are L2s easier to transition to quantum secure systems than the L1 or not, especially ZK SNARK based ones.\n\n\nZK questions\n\n- When we get a snarkified Mainnet, will this increase the resource demand for node runners. As far as I understand especially STARK based proof validation will need a lot of RAM. Can we expect similar efficiency gains as expected for proof generation or are the efficiency gains for proof validation somehow smaller.\n\n- Do you think ZK ASICS will dominate the ZK proof generation soon or will GPUs stay relevant for a longer time as software improvements will keep them competitive.\n\n\nRollup Questions\n\n- How far are rollups regarding data compression. Or in other words, is there still a huge tps gain possible for rollups when they further improve tx compression (https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#3) or is most of the tps scaling coming from how many blobs we provide per slot in the coming years. Or in other words \n\n-  Smaller side question: ZK rollups can store state diffs instead of transaction data in the blobs. Does this meaningfully change the compression efficiency for the rollup or are there other reasons at play.

For governance tokens duration commitments help to align voters with the long term success of that protocol and for LPs it helps to lower the TVL volatility from [liquidity locusts](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/evolutions-in-liquidity-sourcing) as crypto prices change dramatically on shorter time scales. Typically these timelocks either return no token at all e.g. veCRV (but we like tokens), return an NFT (token but no liquidity or price data), or people use liquid lockers like Convex or StakeDao.\n\nThere are a few things I think we can improve on that model. First, assets unlock (become available for sale) according to their lock time and not according to the needs of the protocol. This can lead to systemic but avoidable risks when large players unlock and exit all at once. Second, there's a bunch of unnecessary maintenance in frequently relocking your position. Third, the market answer to both of the above is to wrap the veToken in a liquid locker like Convex and StakeDao which handily defeats the point of a duration commitment from users. The above concerns can be addressed by some subtle changes to the timelock design.\n\nThere are two sides to this both of which can be designed in a variety of ways. On the first side, decoupling from a pure time-based unlock requires some kind of new system parameter. Unlocks could still be a function of time but multiplied by an adjustable rate. This rate could be managed by governance or self-adjusting like interest rates in money markets like crvUSD based on something like the percentage of the supply locked in governance or distance from target liquidity depth. The idea is to make it easier for people to exit when the system is healthy and has what it needs and harder to exit when the system is threatened. I always prefer more intelligent and algorithmic solutions to naive ones and this is an easy way to achieve that. Let's call this dynamic timelocks.\n\nThe second side is the mechanism of the unlock itself. With the veCRV model your voting influence decays to 0 over time but your entire position unlocks at the end of the timelock. People don't like this so they mostly use liquid lockers so they can exit when they want to. However the liquidity on liquid lockers is illusory at best ([CRV liquid lockers](https://crvhub.com/wrappers) depegged almost 50% at the end of 2024), it adds a middleman protocol that extracts value from the base layer and ultimately gains governance control over it, and it would rather seem to defeat the point of a duration commitment from users if users can exit at any moment without penalty. Rather than having users sell an illiquid position, what if they could just buy their way out of the timelock? Practically this may sound equivalent to losing 50% to exit on your cvxCRV position but there are several differences. For one, where does the lost value go? In the current model it goes to whomever buys the token and waits for the repeg. In the case of an official exit penalty though it could go to the protocol as revenue rather than a third party. Second, it could effectively have infinite liquidity depth compared to liquid lockers today and it could achieve that without having to pay extra yield to LPs for the liquid locker token. So, fewer middlemen, better value capture to the protocol, and more deliberate control over exiting.\n\nHow do we implement this? Well it's not hard to imagine a rage quit function on your veToken position that implements the penalty. The penalty could be adjusted to implement a dynamic timelock. This is pretty weak on the tokenization front though. An alternative design being developed by Alchemix is to emit a new token called [Flux](https://alchemixfi.medium.com/vealcx-update-272e8900ac5a) that you can burn to unlock your locked tokens. This monetizes the timelock itself. It's a bit like rate stripping but specifically for timelocks. What I find very interesting about this design is you can just leave everyone \"max locked\" all the time so it removes a whole lot of bookeeping on chain tracking the individual positions and it removes all the maintenance relocking transactions from the system. To combine this with dynamic timelocks you just change the rate at which Flux is emitted by the system so you can manage the amount of unlock overhang at any given time. And there's no particular need to maintain liquidity depth on the Flux token right?

By utilizing decentralized storage options, such as IPFS and Swarm, developers can ensure data availability and persistence without relying on centralized servers. This shift towards decentralized storage aligns with ethereum's fundamental principles of decentralization and censorship resistance, offering more robust and resilient infrastructure for decentralized applications. Additionally, the speaker emphasized the importance of combining blockchain technology with other decentralized technologies to create a more secure and scalable ecosystem for building innovative solutions.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How can the integration of decentralized storage solutions like IPFS and Swarm enhance the overall security and reliability of decentralized applications built on the Ethereum blockchain?\n\n   \n\n2. In what ways do you think the combination of blockchain technology with other decentralized technologies can address the scalability challenges often faced by developers in the blockchain space, and what potential benefits could this convergence bring to the ecosystem?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
