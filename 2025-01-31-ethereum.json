Well, imagine you are a home staker today with some excess bandwidth and disk space on your Ethereum validator and you want to sell this extra capacity to EigenDA. How do you get someone to delegate to you? In EigenLayer the capital provider has to first deposit their LST then they have to select a node operator and delegate that deposit to them. As a node operator, how does someone discover you and why do they trust you? You're probably on page like 100 of the EigenLayer node operator listings and even if someone searches down in the dregs there's not a whole lot of metadata about these node operators someone could use to vet you even if they wanted to. You are beneath the profit margin bar of an LRT protocol like Kelp to be worth vetting. So basically you either delegate capital to yourself which limits how much compute you can provide by how much capital you have or you don't get to participate. But excluding all these operators strongly centralizes the node operator set for AVSs of all kinds which is a pretty unhealthy outcome.\n\nTo change this we need to invert capital deployment from a push model like EigenLayer uses to a pull model like Rocketpool uses. Rather than a capital provider delegating directly to a node operator, the node operator *requests delegation* from a pool of funds. This way the node operator doesn't need to be discovered which is obviously better for smaller operators you've never heard of. When the node operator requests delegation though, why do capital providers trust the node operators not to do something malicious? For centralized LRTs (all of them today), the LRT team serves as a risk underwriter in selecting curated node operators and AVSs to delegate capital to. What's the parallel here? Well, usually the node operator will have to have something at stake equivalent to the RPL stake a Rocketpool node operator has to provide.\n\nHowever, this is going to be a lot more complicated than it is just for ETH staking. Rocketpool has had multiple years to settle on the appropriate fee split and collateralization rules for just one type of compute and yet they are still undergoing dramatic redesigns in their tokenomics to change these dynamics today. So how do you manage the all collateralization rules, fee split rules, and build liquidity on an LRT so it's actually liquid when there are going to be hundreds of AVSs instead of just ETH staking and when the risk appetite of capital providers is so diverse? My answer is instead of trying to wrangle everyone into a single LRT under a single DAO you'll need a market place of many LRTs that can fight for mindshare. Right now, with the centralized LRTs there are about half a dozen of different points on risk spectrum that have representation and the policy of the risk underwriting for each team is entirely opaque. I'd prefer a system where anyone can build their own LRT that represents their risk profile, where hundreds of points can be represented, and which can evolve with this rapidly expanding space.\n\nMellow [is building this](https://docs.mellow.finance/).
