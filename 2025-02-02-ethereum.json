He discussed Tor as a nonprofit free software project designed to provide privacy through decentralization. The project aims to prevent tracking of communication metadata to safeguard user privacy. Roger highlighted the importance of transparency, diversity in relay locations, and building a strong community to sustain Tor's network. He emphasized the legal and technical challenges faced, such as ensuring ISPs understand and support Tor exit relays. Additionally, he discussed the need for wider adoption of privacy tools like Tor and collaboration with projects like Ethereum to promote online privacy and security.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can the principles and challenges faced by the Tor Project in promoting privacy through decentralization be applied to Ethereum and other blockchain projects?\n\n  \n\n- In what ways can collaborations between projects like Tor and Ethereum enhance user privacy and security in the digital world?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

Just yesterday, something called &quot;Bonk Bot&quot; overtook ETH in terms of revenue. Thats a memecoin bot. Phantom wallet is not far behind.... the thought of a wallet of another chain overtaking Ethereum in fees would have been unthinkable just a year ago. Remember Eth community created measuring fees as a way to measure ETH&#39;s superiority vs other projects and is getting out-competed heavily </p>\n\n<p>L2s are equally toxic. Not a single L2 token is investable from any perspective, yet they became ETH&#39;s only hope of scaling. They are all VC controlled garbage whose teams refuse to even add a burn or cash flow or any such thing to the tokens they issued and its been 2 years since ARB &amp; OP issued tokens, they are just horrible memecoins. Whatever value was created on ETH this cycle has all been taken out... in the hundreds of millions by insiders sitting on almost zero cost basis on these L2 tokens. After losing, people wisened up and arent bidding anything on ETH for months</p>\n\n<p>Its not really surprising this whole ecosystem is down 20% when BTC is down just 4.5%</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-02 20:34:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"maookct","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ifrnl9","parent_id":"t1_maomn4r","score":-2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethrocketeer","body":"Thank you for the response.
