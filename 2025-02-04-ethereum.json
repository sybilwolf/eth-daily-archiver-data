It&#39;s just really hard for me to wrap my head around.</p>\n\n<p>Solana is a half as old, homogeneously implemented, datacenter VC chain, with hungry core devs and L1 investors tied into the jurisdiction of an unpredictable government, with unpredictable transaction failures, high inflation and upcoming token dumps. It&#39;s a for-profit endeavor, and you bet that the profit is flowing away from SOL holders in any way the <em>real</em> owners of the network think they can get away with.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Ethereum there&#39;s no philosophy of subtraction, no desire to build a public good, and no desire to lead the blockchain industry with new &quot;0 to 1&quot; tech moments like L2s, zk proofs, DAS, PBS, statelessness, single-slot economic finality, etc. It&#39;s so clear to me that Solana is toxic waste to any institution wanting to build on a neutral network, or any person who wants to store significant wealth on a chain that they can be sure will still exist twenty years from now. Old money trades on NASDAQ, new money trades on Ethereum, volatile money trades on Solana.</p>\n\n<p>At least with Bitcoin, the problems with it are far below the surface, many of them are arguable, and it&#39;s clear Bitcoin is here to stay for three or four more cycles at the very least before its design flaws start setting in.

His comment:\n\n>Solana isn't an isolated pump. SOLETH has been steadily up and to the right for over a year. It's baffling and making me think that maybe maximizing decentralization doesn't maximize returns\n\nLet me disclaim first that I own BTC, ETH, and SOL, in that order of portfolio % with BTC as largest.\n\nI fully agree that you do NOT need maximum decentralization for smart contract chains. You need \"good enough\" decentralization. I want to broaden the conversation though, because I know many here are confused at ETH's price performance over these past few years.\n\nThe main reason for the lackluster performance, and the reson why SOL has eaten (and continues to eat) ETH's lunch is simple: they have a clear, practical mission: **maximize throughput, minimize latency**. That's. It. I'll add as well that they are also laser focused on building the best *consumer-facing product* possible (aka, best UX possible) to become, as Anatoly and others in SOL leadership have said, **decentralized Nasdaq.** I'll add that you could definitely make an argument that the \"centralization\" of Solana leadership is a benefit for the chain, because they provide clear guidance and direction on where to go, what to improve, what's important, etc.\n\nNow, compare the above to Ethereum. **What is Ethereum's mission?** Seriously.
