The premise makes the following assumptions: scalable quantum computers become real, and blockchains need to take mitigating action. The most obvious mitigating action is to invalidate all the vulnerable keys. Then how do you generate new quantum-safe private keys (or proof seeds)? You have to use the seed phrase, as there's nothing else really \"up the chain\" from the private key. Under the premise of quantum computing maturing, Satoshi's coins are either compromised or burned. Unlike with private keys backed by a seed phrase, there is no upgrade path for re-keying the addresses.\n\n3. Bitcoin cannot transition to quantum-resistant cryptography without redefining itself. They can burn all coins in P2PK addresses (likely no seed phrase), then force everyone with P2PKH addresses to re-key, but this comes at the expense of losing immutability of property rights.

And let\u2019s be honest Justin doesn\u2019t have the best track record. Chat gpt summary:\n\n> Justin Drake has made several controversial statements and research decisions that some argue have harmed Ethereum in various ways. Here are a few key points where he has arguably caused issues for Ethereum:\n\n> 1. Publicly Undermining Ethereum\u2019s Security (Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Debates)\n\t\u2022\tClaim: In 2023, Drake stated that Ethereum was \u201cnot secure yet\u201d because it lacked significant MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) burning and relied on social consensus for security.\n\t\u2022\tIssue: This statement fueled concerns that Ethereum\u2019s security model was weaker than Bitcoin\u2019s, potentially discouraging institutional adoption.\n\t\u2022\tImpact: Critics argue that Ethereum researchers should present a more unified and confident stance on Ethereum\u2019s security instead of creating FUD about its own network.\n\n> 2. Overhyping Ethereum 2.0 Timelines\n\t\u2022\tClaim: Before Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Drake was optimistic about Ethereum 2.0 launching sooner than it actually did.\n\t\u2022\tIssue: He projected an overly ambitious timeline for The Merge and sharding, leading to missed expectations.\n\t\u2022\tImpact: Ethereum\u2019s repeated delays (ETH 2.0, sharding, rollups) made some investors skeptical of its long-term roadmap, allowing competitors (like Solana and Avalanche) to capture market share.\n\n> 3. Push for Censorship-Prone Ethereum Post-Merge (MEV & OFAC Compliance)\n\t\u2022\tClaim: Drake was a leading researcher on Ethereum\u2019s MEV design and PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation), which led to increased reliance on Flashbots\u2014a MEV relay that complied with U.S. sanctions.\n\t\u2022\tIssue: When OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, over 70% of Ethereum\u2019s blocks were produced by censorship-compliant relays due to MEV centralization.\n\t\u2022\tImpact: Critics argue that Drake\u2019s MEV research indirectly weakened Ethereum\u2019s censorship resistance, making it more vulnerable to regulatory control than originally intended.\n\n> 4. Promoting a \u201cSocial Slashing\u201d Narrative\n\t\u2022\tClaim: Drake and other Ethereum researchers promoted the idea that Ethereum\u2019s security relies on \u201csocial slashing\u201d\u2014the community could slash stakers who act against social consensus, even outside the protocol\u2019s rules.\n\t\u2022\tIssue:\n\t\u2022\tThis idea conflicts with Ethereum\u2019s claim of being a neutral, rules-based system (like Bitcoin).\n\t\u2022\tIt suggests Ethereum\u2019s finality and immutability can be overridden by a subjective governance process.\n\t\u2022\tImpact:\n\t\u2022\tThis raised concerns that Ethereum is moving toward proof-of-stake governance by social consensus rather than a pure code-based system.\n\t\u2022\tBitcoin maximalists used this as proof that Ethereum is not credibly neutral and could be politically influenced.\n\n> 5.

Here are a few key points where he has arguably caused issues for Ethereum:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Publicly Undermining Ethereum\u2019s Security (Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Debates)\n\u2022 Claim: In 2023, Drake stated that Ethereum was \u201cnot secure yet\u201d because it lacked significant MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) burning and relied on social consensus for security.\n\u2022 Issue: This statement fueled concerns that Ethereum\u2019s security model was weaker than Bitcoin\u2019s, potentially discouraging institutional adoption.\n\u2022 Impact: Critics argue that Ethereum researchers should present a more unified and confident stance on Ethereum\u2019s security instead of creating FUD about its own network.</p></li>\n<li><p>Overhyping Ethereum 2.0 Timelines\n\u2022 Claim: Before Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Drake was optimistic about Ethereum 2.0 launching sooner than it actually did.\n\u2022 Issue: He projected an overly ambitious timeline for The Merge and sharding, leading to missed expectations.\n\u2022 Impact: Ethereum\u2019s repeated delays (ETH 2.0, sharding, rollups) made some investors skeptical of its long-term roadmap, allowing competitors (like Solana and Avalanche) to capture market share.</p></li>\n<li><p>Push for Censorship-Prone Ethereum Post-Merge (MEV &amp; OFAC Compliance)\n\u2022 Claim: Drake was a leading researcher on Ethereum\u2019s MEV design and PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation), which led to increased reliance on Flashbots\u2014a MEV relay that complied with U.S. sanctions.\n\u2022 Issue: When OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, over 70% of Ethereum\u2019s blocks were produced by censorship-compliant relays due to MEV centralization.\n\u2022 Impact: Critics argue that Drake\u2019s MEV research indirectly weakened Ethereum\u2019s censorship resistance, making it more vulnerable to regulatory control than originally intended.</p></li>\n<li><p>Promoting a \u201cSocial Slashing\u201d Narrative\n\u2022 Claim: Drake and other Ethereum researchers promoted the idea that Ethereum\u2019s security relies on \u201csocial slashing\u201d\u2014the community could slash stakers who act against social consensus, even outside the protocol\u2019s rules.\n\u2022 Issue:\n\u2022 This idea conflicts with Ethereum\u2019s claim of being a neutral, rules-based system (like Bitcoin).\n\u2022 It suggests Ethereum\u2019s finality and immutability can be overridden by a subjective governance process.\n\u2022 Impact:\n\u2022 This raised concerns that Ethereum is moving toward proof-of-stake governance by social consensus rather than a pure code-based system.\n\u2022 Bitcoin maximalists used this as proof that Ethereum is not credibly neutral and could be politically influenced.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lack of Emphasis on Decentralization (Rollups &amp; Layer 2 Strategy)\n\u2022 Claim: Drake has been a strong advocate of Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap, arguing that Ethereum should focus on Layer 2 scaling instead of increasing its base layer capacity.\n\u2022 Issue:\n\u2022 Rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism rely on centralized sequencers, meaning most Ethereum transactions today pass through centralized intermediaries.\n\u2022 Instead of scaling Ethereum directly, this model makes Ethereum dependent on external L2 projects that can censor users.\n\u2022 Impact:\n\u2022 Some argue that Ethereum should have prioritized on-chain scaling, like increasing block sizes or improving execution-layer efficiency, rather than offloading transactions to semi-centralized rollups.\n\u2022 Rollups are not yet fully decentralized, creating security and censorship risks.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>While Justin Drake is a brilliant researcher, his public statements and research direction have arguably created unnecessary FUD about Ethereum\u2019s security and decentralization.

But I think it&#39;s overestimated. Bitcoiners want to preserve &quot;core ossification&quot;, &quot;simplicity&quot;, &quot;less major change in the protocol&quot; and &quot;non interventionism&quot; (e.g. freezing Satoshi coins to make sure they can&#39;t be stolen), but they even more want to preserve the Bitcoin protocol itself. If it requires a hard fork to survive, I am sure a part of the community will push for it and the rest will follow because if they have no plan, their fork will just disappear because it will be cracked somehow at some point.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-06 09:52:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mbbvhji","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iiwqbz","parent_id":"t1_mbbr4wp","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/majorpickle01","body":"I largely agree with you, but I still think it will cause a major schism initially, with splintering factions wanting different way to deal with it. \n\nA pure survival responce is often not unified.
