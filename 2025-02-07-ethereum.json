Farmer critiques the narrative that Solana is outperforming Ethereum, arguing that Solana&#39;s economic value is largely driven by speculative memecoin trading, which is unsustainable. He warns that this reliance on memecoins poses risks for Solana&#39;s long-term valuation, while Ethereum maintains a more robust ecosystem. The author concludes that skepticism is needed regarding narratives that favor specific projects without critical analysis of their underlying economic activities.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-07 05:29:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mbh3gsu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ijp7n3","parent_id":"t1_mbg1y9w","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"got your Comment approved due to low karma or account age.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>got your Comment approved due to low karma or account age.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-08 19:08:26","distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"id":"mbrwo1k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ijp7n3","parent_id":"t1_mbh3gsu","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/clamchoda","body":"\u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064 ETH TAKE MY ENERGY \u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064 ETH TAKE MY ENERGY \u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-07 07:25:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mbhoju7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ijp7n3","parent_id":"t3_1ijp7n3","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/masahirox","body":"I love you!! \n\n\ud83d\udd12ETH\ud83d\udd12","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I love you!! </p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd12ETH\ud83d\udd12</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-07 07:45:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mbhsmsb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ijp7n3","parent_id":"t1_mbhoju7","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Ethical-trade","body":"We're at the point where even a doubling in btc ratio would still be lame.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>We&#39;re at the point where even a doubling in btc ratio would still be lame.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-07 12:11:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mbjcmn9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ijp7n3","parent_id":"t3_1ijp7n3","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/NeedlerOP","body":"sry m8, best i can do is cycle top 0.03","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>sry m8, best i can do is cycle top 0.03</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-07 12:13:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mbjd47y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ijp7n3","parent_id":"t1_mbjcmn9","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/amufydd","body":"So $500m of ETF inflows in last week or so and we are dumping like a rock?

While there's truth to market irrationality, consistently underperforming despite \"fundamentals\" should raise concerns, not just be brushed aside.  It's a cope because it avoids acknowledging potential weaknesses or issues within Ethereum itself.\n\nOverly optimistic about Ethereum's trajectory: The text paints a rosy picture of Ethereum's future, emphasizing \"evolving, scaling, staking, and real transaction demand.\"  While these are positive aspects, they don't guarantee success. Scaling solutions have faced delays and challenges, and \"real transaction demand\" is somewhat subjective and can fluctuate.  The text treats these positive factors as certainties rather than possibilities, which is a form of coping.\n\nFocus on Bitcoin's potential failure: The text spends a significant portion discussing the potential for Bitcoin's collapse due to miner manipulation. This feels like a \"whataboutism\" \u2013 shifting focus to a competitor's potential problems to distract from Ethereum's current situation. It's a cope because it avoids directly addressing Ethereum's own challenges by pointing fingers elsewhere.  It implies that even if Ethereum isn't doing great right now, Bitcoin is in even worse shape, therefore Ethereum is \"good enough.\"\n\n\"Patience wins\" narrative:  The concluding statement, \"Eventually, the market catches up, until then, patience wins,\" is a classic coping mechanism. It suggests that simply holding on and waiting will eventually lead to success, regardless of any necessary adjustments or changes in strategy. This ignores the possibility that the market might never \"catch up\" and that Ethereum's perceived value might not materialize.\n\n\"Too many holders, too much utility, and too little sell pressure\": While these factors can contribute to price stability, they are not foolproof.  \"Too many holders\" can turn into a problem if sentiment shifts and everyone tries to sell at once. \"Too much utility\" is debatable and depends on adoption, and \"too little sell pressure\" is a temporary condition that can change rapidly.  Presenting these as guarantees of future success is a form of coping.\n\nConspiracy theory about Bitcoin miners: The detailed scenario about Bitcoin miners shorting and attacking the network sounds like a conspiracy theory.

While there&#39;s truth to market irrationality, consistently underperforming despite &quot;fundamentals&quot; should raise concerns, not just be brushed aside.  It&#39;s a cope because it avoids acknowledging potential weaknesses or issues within Ethereum itself.</p>\n\n<p>Overly optimistic about Ethereum&#39;s trajectory: The text paints a rosy picture of Ethereum&#39;s future, emphasizing &quot;evolving, scaling, staking, and real transaction demand.&quot;  While these are positive aspects, they don&#39;t guarantee success. Scaling solutions have faced delays and challenges, and &quot;real transaction demand&quot; is somewhat subjective and can fluctuate.  The text treats these positive factors as certainties rather than possibilities, which is a form of coping.</p>\n\n<p>Focus on Bitcoin&#39;s potential failure: The text spends a significant portion discussing the potential for Bitcoin&#39;s collapse due to miner manipulation. This feels like a &quot;whataboutism&quot; \u2013 shifting focus to a competitor&#39;s potential problems to distract from Ethereum&#39;s current situation. It&#39;s a cope because it avoids directly addressing Ethereum&#39;s own challenges by pointing fingers elsewhere.  It implies that even if Ethereum isn&#39;t doing great right now, Bitcoin is in even worse shape, therefore Ethereum is &quot;good enough.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Patience wins&quot; narrative:  The concluding statement, &quot;Eventually, the market catches up, until then, patience wins,&quot; is a classic coping mechanism. It suggests that simply holding on and waiting will eventually lead to success, regardless of any necessary adjustments or changes in strategy. This ignores the possibility that the market might never &quot;catch up&quot; and that Ethereum&#39;s perceived value might not materialize.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Too many holders, too much utility, and too little sell pressure&quot;: While these factors can contribute to price stability, they are not foolproof.  &quot;Too many holders&quot; can turn into a problem if sentiment shifts and everyone tries to sell at once. &quot;Too much utility&quot; is debatable and depends on adoption, and &quot;too little sell pressure&quot; is a temporary condition that can change rapidly.

They also mention that, as VCs, they\u2019re seeing a lot more talent moving to Solana. According to them, developers are favoring the SVM because that\u2019s where they\u2019re finding success and users. They even go as far as saying they can no longer, in good conscience, advise startups to launch on Ethereum and are instead pushing them toward Solana.\n\nNow, as an Ethereum maxi who has done some dev work on Ethereum and EVM, this doesn\u2019t match what I\u2019ve seen in my (admittedly limited) bubble.
