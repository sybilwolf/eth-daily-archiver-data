Here are my thoughts about it:\n\n\n\nIt always was and still is the goal to scale the L1, but scaling the L1 is more difficult than scaling through rollups, so it takes more time. If you would have increased the L1 throughput by 4-8 times many years ago we would have had the following issues.\n\n\n\nState and history size: We would be in the range of 4-12 TB of disk usage. Not that easy to find good nvme ssds in that size range. Until 8 TB there are options, but only recently there are consumer options. If you need to go above 8 TB there are only server grade ones and they cost an arm and a leg.\n\nSSD speed: Already nowadays you need good ssds to have a good attestation efficiency. With state being 4-8 times bigger you probably need some of the best ones out there, or even store most of the state in RAM like solana is doing. Not cheap to build a machine like that.\n\n\n\nCPU usage. With a small state and the current number of transactions per block we can easily validate a block within the few seconds we have. If you increase the block size the validation time jumps linearly at first and when the state size grows over time the validation time grows superlinear in the long term. Just a few years ago we could not handle that. Nowadays a mainnet block takes a few hundred milliseconds to validate on consumer hardware so we could easily increase it maybe by a factor of 2-4 at the moment by just looking at CPU usage.\n\n\n\nBandwidth: That is the most difficult one to judge. We already know that 10Mbps upload speeds have issues publishing self built blocks. Currently even in the developed world huge parts have upload speeds of 20Mbps-30Mbps, so there is a limit how much you can grow a block before you hit that limit. \n\n\n\nAll these factors together limit the scope of how much you can scale L1 while still keeping the chain decentralized in the sense that home stakers can participate. Sure, we could go the server chain route and Polygon POS and Binance smart chain have shown that you can easily increase throughput by an order of magnitude if you do that.  but Ethereum wants to be the global and neutral settlement layer so it takes decentralization and resilience road instead short term maximum throughput road. If a chain cannot be validated by a large group of unsophisticated actors anymore it becomes a chain that you have to trust intermediaries to not take your wealth from you.\n\n\n\nSo, realistically we can probably safely increase the block size after pectra by a factor of 2, if you are adventurous a large factor is possible, but we probably better wait for upgrades which tackle the problems above. \n\n\n\nSee my comment to this post for the continuation.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yesterday, <a href=\"/u/Numerous_Ruin_4947\">u/Numerous_Ruin_4947</a> had a question about L1 scaling and was wondering why we did not increase the block size by a factor of 4-8 yet <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ijp7n3/daily%5C_general%5C_discussion%5C_february%5C_07%5C_2025/mblwriu/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ijp7n3/daily\\_general\\_discussion\\_february\\_07\\_2025/mblwriu/</a>.

He highlighted the diversity of existing light clients in Ethereum and the need to improve options for Layer 2 (L2) light clients. Noah explained the workings of light clients, emphasizing the consensus and execution layers, and discussed the challenges with L2 light client consensus without validators from Ethereum. He proposed the use of irreversible and validity gadgets to enhance light client security and latency trade-offs in L2 solutions, providing insights into various gadgets and economic incentives for bonders in the ecosystem. Additionally, he addressed potential protocol changes to optimize the balance between security and latency for rollup light clients, affirming the ongoing importance of light clients even with the move towards stateless clients in Ethereum's future.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How do the proposed irreversible and validity gadgets suggested by Noah Citron contribute to enhancing security and addressing latency trade-offs in Layer 2 light client solutions in Ethereum?\n\n   \n\n2.

For this you would need significantly more than 51% of hashpower, depending on how often the checkpoint is made. At 51% you are still better off playing fair, because more often than not you won't be able to outrun the rest of the network before the next checkpoint. I'd say at this point the standard bitcoiner's response - \"this would decrease bitcoin's value, so you are better off not doing it\" - is probably right.
