For example, US based car manufacturers will struggle without North American free trade whereas Tesla is much more diversified and relies more heavily on China who so far, only has a 10% additional tariff. So I don't understand your point here because there is no case to be made that the new guard will be any better and good evidence that they will be much worse. At least with the old guard there were strategic advantages to having subsidised farming, unlike blanket tariffs across all product categories which have the negative of reducing consumption but without the benefit of protecting local producers that specific, strategic tariffs have.\n\n>To call ALL of this as just \"far right wokeness\" is just disengenuous.\n\nI didn't use that term. Frankly \"wokeness\" is an intentionally vague term which is simply used as a scapegoat and a distraction which enrages emotional, undereducated voters. I mean, there are so many problems in society today so why on earth do people spend so much time focusing on queer people?! That is not rational, productive discourse for the masses.

However, the idea that a cabal of billionaires will do what is in the public&#39;s best interest is unbelievably naive.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We vote in politicians who make sweet deals with big pharma or Big Ag etc and when they are done, these fat cats go sit on the boards of the very companies they sweetened up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And now a bunch of politicians and billionaires are now in power, up near the top is Elon Musk who will conveniently benefit very greatly from Trump&#39;s proposed tariffs so far. For example, US based car manufacturers will struggle without North American free trade whereas Tesla is much more diversified and relies more heavily on China who so far, only has a 10% additional tariff. So I don&#39;t understand your point here because there is no case to be made that the new guard will be any better and good evidence that they will be much worse. At least with the old guard there were strategic advantages to having subsidised farming, unlike blanket tariffs across all product categories which have the negative of reducing consumption but without the benefit of protecting local producers that specific, strategic tariffs have.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To call ALL of this as just &quot;far right wokeness&quot; is just disengenuous.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t use that term.
