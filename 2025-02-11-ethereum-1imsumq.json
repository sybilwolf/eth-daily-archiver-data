He highlighted the issues of front running and censorship in blockchain transactions, emphasizing the need for encrypted MLE as a solution. Mark presented a comprehensive overview of encrypted MLE design space, including the role of The Keeper, various keeper designs ranging from trusted to trustless, and the importance of enforcing transaction inclusion in blocks. He proposed EIP 7793 as a minimal change to support out-of-protocol MLE checks in smart contracts, and discussed strategies for hiding transaction metadata to enhance privacy. Audience questions focused on the overhead of the process, the effectiveness of encrypted MLE in preventing front running, and the comparison with flash Bots in terms of avoiding sandwich attacks and user experience. Mark emphasized the importance of progressively moving towards more trustless solutions and improving user trust models in transaction handling on Ethereum L1.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How do you think the implementation of encrypted MLE in the Nethermind client addresses the challenges of front running and censorship in blockchain transactions? Can encrypted MLE truly prevent these issues effectively?\n\n\n\n- In what ways do you see the proposed EIP 7793 supporting out-of-protocol MLE checks impacting the overall privacy and security of transactions on Ethereum L1? What are the potential implications of this minimal change?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
