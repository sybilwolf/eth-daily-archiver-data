Like sure, the entry level of 32 ETH is still no joke, but at least if you want to add more you don&#39;t have to wait until you&#39;re ready to commit 32 more if I&#39;m understanding this correctly.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-13 14:48:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mcmuogd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iodft9","parent_id":"t3_1iodft9","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"There will be a live demo during the EthStaker Pectra Holesky launch call","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There will be a live demo during the EthStaker Pectra Holesky launch call</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-13 18:21:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mcnx3xw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iodft9","parent_id":"t1_mcmuogd","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Fiberpunk2077","body":"Regarding your second point for adding ETH as a deposit, I'm *assuming* you would be able to use the Top Up deposit from the Ethereum Staking Launchpad: https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/top-up","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Regarding your second point for adding ETH as a deposit, I&#39;m <em>assuming</em> you would be able to use the Top Up deposit from the Ethereum Staking Launchpad: <a href=\"https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/top-up\">https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/top-up</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-13 17:35:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mcnp3cd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iodft9","parent_id":"t1_mcmuogd","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/1l0o","body":"Oooh nice, that would be ideal, also had no idea that existed, thanks.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Oooh nice, that would be ideal, also had no idea that existed, thanks.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-13 17:36:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mcnpci4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iodft9","parent_id":"t1_mcnp3cd","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/offthewall1066","body":"It's amazing how little wall street understands about crypto and Coinbase.

He emphasized the trend of apps incorporating wallet components without foregrounding them, showcasing examples like Deflow and Bags that abstract away the wallet experience for users. Itai highlighted the importance of aggregating various wallets to avoid asset fragmentation and ensure a seamless user experience.

He emphasized the trend of apps incorporating wallet components without foregrounding them, showcasing examples like Deflow and Bags that abstract away the wallet experience for users. Itai highlighted the importance of aggregating various wallets to avoid asset fragmentation and ensure a seamless user experience. He addressed security concerns related to managing parent-child wallet relationships, suggesting strategies like creating multiple identities and emphasizing the optionality of asset consolidation to mitigate risks.

However, in practice for L1 transactions you can always submit them to private MEV-blocking mempools such as Flashbots Protect RPC. If they were to front-run your transaction, they would lose their reputation (and there's no reason they couldn't be regulated just like traditional brokers, for a legal guarantee against front-running). For L2, there are several mitigations an L2 chain can implement to prevent front-running.\n\n2a) Simply-implemented smart contracts (like Uniswap) can be subject to front-running in the form of MEV, but newer smart contract designs (like Cowswap) eliminate the possibility for front-running altogether. In other words, to prevent front-running, you can design your smart contract system in such a way that front-running is not useful or profitable, and does not hurt the user if it does occur.\n\n2b) There's some research to mitigate L1 front-running at the protocol level. AFAIK if we can get proposer-builder separation included on Ethereum, then MEV will become visible to the protocol. Once the protocol can \"see\" MEV, then it can refund the majority of it to the user who transacted. This means the user gets refunded the real economic value of their transaction being front-run, making them whole. Don't quote me on this, though.\n\nMEV is very 2021 in a lot of ways.

If internet latency didn't exist, and every node's ping time to every other node was exactly 0ms, then everyone would be able to trivially agree on the exact order that transactions were broadcast to the network, because they could all receive and timestamp all incoming transactions at the exact same time (using NTP/PTP!).\n\nIn other words you can think of latency as causing everyone to have a different \"view\" of the Ethereum network. Say that your node is in Hawaii: that means you'll hear about new Ethereum transactions originating in Hawaii potentially many hundreds of milliseconds before you hear about a transaction that was broadcast in the UK. Whereas a node in the UK would hear about the UK-broadcasted transaction first by a lot. Compounding this subjectivity is that nodes only typically connect to 100 other nodes or so, so it could easily take 2-3 hops for a transaction broadcast to reach you (maybe nearly an entire second), depending on the exact topology of the messy, ad-hoc and ever-changing Ethereum network.\n\nIf Ethereum had one central validator that we could trust to order transactions properly, then we wouldn't have any transaction ordering issues. But since Ethereum validators are permissionless, if we're given some random validator an anonymous person is running, it's impossible for an outsider to determine that they ordered transactions in a different way than they actually heard them on the network. They may as well have just heard them from the network in that order. In other words it's impossible for anyone to determine objectively without having to trust *someone* at their word, which we can't do because, well, Ethereum is designed so that nobody needs to trust each other.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you for the feedback on my explanation!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s difficult for me, as someone relatively unfamiliar with the inner workings of the chain, to understand why something like NTP or PTP in traditional networking can&#39;t be implemented to ensure transactions are executed in chronological order to help prevent front-running. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The basic gist is this: The nature of the internet means transactions arrive at <em>your Ethereum node</em> in a specific order, but nobody else can tell exactly what order that is, because they don&#39;t also have a machine sitting on your home LAN connected to all the other same nodes as you with the exact same internet latency to each one, to be able to double check that you&#39;re not lying about the exact order you heard transactions from other nodes in.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, because the internet has latency (sometimes a whole lot) and so is not a perfectly instant communication system, this means transaction ordering within a block is inherently subjective. If internet latency didn&#39;t exist, and every node&#39;s ping time to every other node was exactly 0ms, then everyone would be able to trivially agree on the exact order that transactions were broadcast to the network, because they could all receive and timestamp all incoming transactions at the exact same time (using NTP/PTP!).</p>\n\n<p>In other words you can think of latency as causing everyone to have a different &quot;view&quot; of the Ethereum network. Say that your node is in Hawaii: that means you&#39;ll hear about new Ethereum transactions originating in Hawaii potentially many hundreds of milliseconds before you hear about a transaction that was broadcast in the UK. Whereas a node in the UK would hear about the UK-broadcasted transaction first by a lot.
