The team discussed the basics of ZK email, making proofs easily, a new registry in SDK for reusing proofs, and expanding the use cases of ZK proofs. They highlighted the potential applications such as building marketplaces on top of emails and email-triggered transactions on-chain. The team also demonstrated the process of account recovery using email guardians and integrating ZK proofs into existing applications, aiming to simplify the development process for users. They also addressed questions regarding ZKP frameworks used, key rotation, security of domain public keys, and the application of ZK proofs for email verification.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How might the integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) into email applications revolutionize the way we think about account recovery and security protocols?\n\n- What potential challenges do you foresee in implementing ZKPs for email verification at scale, and how could these challenges be addressed within the context of user privacy and security?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
