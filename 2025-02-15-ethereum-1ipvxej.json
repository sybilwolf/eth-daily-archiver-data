Here in web3 fewer of us every year qualify as normal. You see, market selling means you have to sell, which means you need liquidity to sell into, you are creating taxable events, etc. A less considered alternative to market selling is to buy a 1x short position somehow. If you hold both then as the asset price rides the famous crypto roller coaster the long would make money and the short would lose the same amount of money or vice versa. The result is zero change wrt whatever your short it redeemable in. Monetarily it's very similar to selling the position as long as you can exercise the put. A position that is not subject to price volatility is called [delta neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp).\n\nThere's a few fun advantages to this. As mentioned above, it might allow you to defer a taxable event on the asset being sold until long term capital gains would kick in which is useful even if the option comes at a premium. In addition to this, what if the token you would be selling was interest bearing? By continuing to hold it you continue to collect interest. As long as the interest on the long exceeds the cost to borrow or premium on the put you're now profiting from a carry trade. [I wrote about a different variety of a carry trade](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harvesting-interest-rate-spreads) a few years ago which may be worth revisiting to see how it has played out. There's a few other facts worth noting here as well.\n\nFirst, while I did say to buy a 1x short position, you are going to almost certainly use the long position as a collateral to borrow and create a 1x short position. This saves you from needing to come up with more capital. If you use a money market to execute the max short you can walk away with the stablecoins but you probably can't actually get to a delta neutral position due to LTV (loan to value) caps. This is still a nice option but there are risks I talk about in the post linked above. Otherwise you can use a variety of leverage platforms to get that LTV up to 100% and actually be delta neutral but you won't be able to withdraw the stablecoins.\n\nThis brings me to the second useful fact. The cost to short crypto is usually less than the cost to long due to the industry being generally bullish over the years. Case in point, this is why that icETH token is still making money years later. This fact is dead obvious if you looking at the funding rates on perpetual swap platforms. When [this line](https://cryptoquant.com/asset/eth/chart/derivatives/funding-rates?exchange=all_exchange&window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=log&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=column) is above zero, it means you can get paid taking a short position.\n\nCombined, you are now in a position where you are making money on both the collateral and the short position of your delta neutral portfolio. That is just wild. So instead of selling your crypto, invoking a taxable event, and making stablecoin yield you can instead enter a delta neutral position, forfeit any profit from price appreciation, but retain collateral + funding rate yield while deferring a taxable event on the crypto collateral for as long as you like.\n\nAn astute reader will be asking themselves what is preventing someone from just buying crypto and entering such a position immediately from stablecoins? Nothing at all. You can do exactly that. If you do this with ETH you are giving up the stablecoin yield which is most likely sourced in some way from US treasuries in exchange for staking + funding rate yield. This can be advantageous in certain macro environments such as when fed interest rates are low and it's a risk-on environment with a lot of demand for leverage so the funding rates are high.\n\nOf course [someone](https://docs.ethena.fi/) has already tokenized this idea so you don't have to manage the short position yourself and worry about brief fluctuations in the LST peg or funding rates. For a delta neutral position the most natural denomination is in whatever you are delta neutral to. This is going to most commonly be USD so the token wrapper around this position is a stablecoin.\n\nThis leads us to a new paradigm for stablecoin design. Consider stablecoin designs to date. How do they protect their peg in order to be stable? I see three basic mechanisms in play all of which lead to problems constraining adoption.\n\n1) Redeemable reserves. These have the hardest peg but are ultimately only as strong as the underlying asset they are redeemable for. Stablecoins such as USDC are backed by treasuries and redeemable for USD so they are subject to government default/control. Furthermore, Circle can just blacklist your address. Stablecoins backed by USDC such as FRAX inherit this problem. LUSD/BOLD are backed by redeemable ETH collateral which leads to a hard peg but the redemptions force borrowers to maintain terrible LTV ratios which limits adoption.\n\n2) Dynamic rates. USDS/DAI and similar coins are all borrowed into existence. They retain their peg by manipulating supply and demand of the token using variable interest rates. This leads to two problems. First, the interest rates are usually subject to intervention which is fallible. Second, the price experiences significant short term depegs before interest rate changes can kick in and restore the peg over a matter of days/weeks.\n\n3) Revenue. Tokens like alUSD are backed by revenue from the collateral assets. This has proven to provide a relative weak peg and we regularly see tokens like this multiple percent off their peg. This is not a hallmark of a stablecoin and obviously limits their adoption as a token to hold for stable value.\n\nSome tokens combine more than one of these approaches. For example crvUSD combines both reserves and programmatic adjustments to interest rates.\n\nContrast this with a stablecoin wrapping a delta neutral position which I'll call dnUSD which could be backed by any interest bearing collateral for which there is enough depth in options/perpetuals markets for any like-kind asset.\n\n1) Unlike USDC, Circle can't blacklist an address. dnUSD isn't derived from USD in any way therefore the US government default on US treasury bills or seize the underlying reserves.\n\n2) There is no need for a DAO to set or manipulate rates. The only rates are the collateral rate (e.g. staking) and the funding rate both of which are set by wider market forces that are difficult to manipulate.\n\n3) Like LUSD this should be redeemable for the underlying but without the terrible UX to borrowers and LTV inefficiencies. This creates the necessary stability for adoption as a stablecoin.\n\n4) Unlike borrowed stablecoins which are limited to scale with the demand for leverage, dnUSD adds revenue from the collateral. This enables to scale beyond the 0 funding rate line as far negative as the interest from the collateral. This is mathematically more scalable.\n\nSo what started as a way to potentially defer a taxable event to reduce tax obligations led to potentially the best pattern we have seen for a truly decentralized stablecoin once we wrapped the position in a token. That's actually rather profound.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A normal person investing in assets enters a position by buying the asset and then exits the position by selling the asset.

The workshop covered topics such as user research tools, customer journey mapping, and conducting user interviews to create the best user experience. The speaker, a product designer at Matter Labs, shared insights from their experience in user-centric design within the blockchain space, emphasizing the need to understand users to create effective solutions. Attendees engaged in practical exercises such as conducting user interviews, analyzing results, and creating customer journey maps to refine design decisions and optimize user experiences. The workshop provided insights on qualitative and quantitative user research methods and practical tips for gathering actionable insights from users.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How can incorporating user experience research methods, such as customer journey mapping and user interviews, into blockchain product development enhance the overall user experience and adoption?\n\n\n\n2. In what ways can understanding users' needs and behaviors through qualitative and quantitative research methods influence design decisions and the optimization of user experiences within the blockchain space?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
