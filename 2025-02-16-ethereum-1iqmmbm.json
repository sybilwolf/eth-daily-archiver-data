He emphasized the importance of defining Dows as decentralized and autonomous organizations. Shapiro discussed the various trust issues faced by Dows and highlighted the need for techniques, both on-chain and off-chain, to address these challenges efficiently. He introduced the concept of \"Borgs\" as a way to coordinate and manage decentralized organizations effectively, emphasizing the market potential for different Borgs providing specific functions to various organizations.\n\n\n\nShapiro also pointed out the parallelism between the modular trend in blockchains, where highly decentralized layer 1 networks interact with more centralized and expendable layer 2 networks, and the design of Dows and Borgs.

The point is that these coins that are built around only hype are high risk. Yes you could have made 5x on XRP, but you could also play roulette at a casino and make 35x your money, at the cost of more risk. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of trying to trade in hind sight. Yes XRP has done 5x, but would you have taken the risk back in Oct that it would do that?</p>\n\n<p>I personally don&#39;t care what these other coins perform compared to ETH, because I was never willing to take the risk with them. The fundamentals of ETH make me confident in the long term performance, and I would never risk my money without that fundamental backing.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-16 17:44:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"md6dqd0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iqmmbm","parent_id":"t1_md5ugik","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/confusedguy1212","body":"Man I feel this","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Man I feel this</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-16 17:18:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"md69ahw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iqmmbm","parent_id":"t1_md5ugik","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Atyzzze","body":"> Please for the love of the universe and all that is in it, give it to us.
