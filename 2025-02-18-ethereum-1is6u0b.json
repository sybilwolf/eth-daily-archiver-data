[See here for example.](https://x.com/jon_charb/status/1891185790182375664) I have been thinking about this discussion a lot because both seem to be right. After thinking about for some time, I think they indeed are both right (though they also discuss from different perspectives). Let me try to explain why: \n\nWhat is REV at all? Real economic value is the revenue a chain/ network makes *from its users*. --> Network Fees + MEV Tips. \n\nAs you can see it does not include issuance, cause issuance is a) not paid by users and b) not a really good metric because with high inflation a chain could fake high revenues... and that doesn't make a lot of sense, at least not down the road. \n\nSo Victor argues that REV is a stupid metric, cause it includes MEV while Jon Charb (who came up with REV) still believes it's a good metric. \n\nI believe Victor is right when he says \"\\[...\\]you want MEV of all kinds to be minimized.\" and \"You want as much MEV to be retained by users, defi protocols, etc as possible rather than leaking.\" \n\nMEV should be redistributed to the users creating it whenever possible. I think that's a common idea by now.  I think his wording isn't perfect, but the concept is right. \n\nAt the same time I believe that Jon Charb is also right when he says he wants Citadels profits to be as high as possible *if he is a stakeholder*. \n\nBlockchains or even ecosystems like Ethereum are a complex network and system. There are different forces pulling into different directions. In the case of MEV rational stakers want max MEV for themselves. At the same time defi protocols want to minimize MEV for their users.

After thinking about for some time, I think they indeed are both right (though they also discuss from different perspectives). Let me try to explain why: </p>\n\n<p>What is REV at all? Real economic value is the revenue a chain/ network makes <em>from its users</em>. --&gt; Network Fees + MEV Tips. </p>\n\n<p>As you can see it does not include issuance, cause issuance is a) not paid by users and b) not a really good metric because with high inflation a chain could fake high revenues... and that doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense, at least not down the road. </p>\n\n<p>So Victor argues that REV is a stupid metric, cause it includes MEV while Jon Charb (who came up with REV) still believes it&#39;s a good metric. </p>\n\n<p>I believe Victor is right when he says &quot;[...]you want MEV of all kinds to be minimized.&quot; and &quot;You want as much MEV to be retained by users, defi protocols, etc as possible rather than leaking.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>MEV should be redistributed to the users creating it whenever possible. I think that&#39;s a common idea by now.  I think his wording isn&#39;t perfect, but the concept is right. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time I believe that Jon Charb is also right when he says he wants Citadels profits to be as high as possible <em>if he is a stakeholder</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Blockchains or even ecosystems like Ethereum are a complex network and system.
