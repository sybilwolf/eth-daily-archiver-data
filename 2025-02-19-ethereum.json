Aztec is a very important project, but because it is privacy focussed it works differently than other rollups. I had some questions, but we both weren't 100% sure how it works... So I have done some digging today ([mainly using the official docs](https://docs.aztec.network/aztec)) and wanted to share my learnings with you. \n\nIn Aztec there is public and private state. As stated yesterday I believe both public and private state is needed to allow for more than just transactions, e.g. swaps, lending/ borrowing etc. Only of the balance of two assets in an AMM is public, you know the price. If it was private, the swap can't be done. Only if the balance of an asset (and the APY) you want to borrow is public, you can actually borrow it. Why? Because only if the information is public, you as the user can create a valid zk proof for these transactions. \n\nSo how do private and public transactions work together?\n\nPrivate transactions are client-side only. What does that mean? The user starts a transaction (e.g. sending ETH to a friend) and creates a zk proof for it. If you interacted with Aztec 2 or 3 years ago, you might remember that back then transactions took some time. I believe back then it was the same thing: you first had / have to create a zk proof of the transaction, meaning you proof that you have the funds to send. That takes time because the creation of a zk proof is still a lot of compute (at least compared to non zk execution). Then send the zk proof without any inputs (your own balance, your public key, the receiving public key) to the public side of the rollup, in this case to the aztec node = the sequencer. The sequencer includes your transaction in a block and later that block is settled on Ethereum mainnet. \n\nSo how does the receiver know that I sent them funds? Aztec uses a UTXO model for that. With the zk proof the sender also creates a UTXO representing the funds. This UTXO is also forwarded to the sequencer for inclusion in the rollup. It is encrypted and only the receiver can decrypt it. If the receiver \"sees\" a UTXO for them, they can spend it by nullifying it, by proving ownership of it, nullifying it and creating a new UTXO for the next recipient. \n\nSo how can I do a private transaction that touches public state without revealing it is me, e.g. swapping ETH for USD? \n\nPrivate transactions that trigger public functions, like swaps on a DEX. The setup seems to be very similar: \n\nYou create a zk proof on the client side that shows you have the funds to make the swap and what you should receive from the AMM. You send the zk proof and a UTXO for the swap to the roll up nodes. The nodes job is then to execute the public functions and to hence to execute the swap, adding the UTXO balance to the pool and creating a new UTXO with the funds the initiator is supposed to receive. \n\nBut the nodes create the UTXO and hence know who the receiver is? This means its's not private anymore?! Apparently the UTXO is for an anonymous contract, that is somehow controlled by your private address. So it is private indeed. \n\nSo what's the role of the provers? The provers take all transactions of the network, generate zk proofs for them and aggregate these proofs to include them in the rollup and settle them on Ethereum. \n\nP.S. I have no idea if this is correct, most of the time I have no idea what I am doing, especially when it comes to tech/ black magic, so please take this with a grain of salt!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yesterday <a href=\"/u/haurog\">u/haurog</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1is6u0b/comment/mdegb4c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">shared an update on aztec</a>.
