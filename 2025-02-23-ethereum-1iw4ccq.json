So as a disclaimer, once again, I'm obviously being paid to work for this team and I have purchased a portion of the token supply with my own funds alongside a small compensation package, so do keep this in mind. I intend to be transparent with any token sales I make though. I'm also more than happy to discuss any details in my DMs!\n\nFor those of you who didn't see my previous post, the project, Trackgood, is a supply chain tracking and transparency solution with a working enterprise product on Base.\n\nJumping into the update, we're a few weeks away from launching our biggest upgrade since the token launch \u2014 Scan to Earn. The basic premise here is to incentivise users to collect ESG and sustainability data to train our AI which specialises in product claims. After all, most products don't use our tracking solution but consumers will still want to know about these other products. So for products which already have 3rd party certifications by established organisations verifying impacts like organic or Fairtrade standards, we want to track that too. So if we incentivise users to \"scan\" products they see \u2014 simply by taking pictures of the packaging, we can use these images and have our AI analyse the packaging. Once the AI picks up these official certifications on product packaging, the data is verified and used to create an enormous database of ESG product claims for our AI to pull from.\n\nOnce the update is live, users will collect points for every viable scan which contributes to our product database. Token rewards will be distributed proportionally to the points received in each reward period. If we're able to collect enough data from around the world, this will provide us with enough ESG claims data to allow our AI to become an industry-leading tool.\n\nSo if this sounds interesting to you at all, please head on over to [our web app](https://app.trackgood.io) to create an account. As previously mentioned, this tool hasn't quite launched yet, but you will be notified once it goes live if you do sign up. Please note that sign-up is with email, so if you're privacy conscious, keep that in mind. Connecting your wallet is possible but not a requirement as a custodial wallet is built in for easy non-crypto native UX.\n\n^(Also, if you saw my post the other day about me building something, this post is not what I was referring to.

The project aims to improve the decentralized web infrastructure by providing a high-performance and developer-friendly implementation of Ethereum. The WTH team has prioritized stability, performance, and extensibility, emphasizing feedback loops to enhance the node's capabilities. The project has seen significant community engagement with over 400 contributors and a strong open-source development culture. Additionally, plans for future improvements include enhancing developer tools, scaling gas throughput, and exploring blockchain scalability solutions.\n\n\n\nThe speaker highlighted the challenges faced during the development process, such as testing issues, benchmarking difficulties, and maintaining contributor-friendliness when building open-source projects. They emphasized the importance of establishing polished issue trackers, comprehensive documentation, robust testing practices, responsive maintainers, and supportive community interactions to foster a thriving ecosystem. The talk also addressed the future direction of the WTH project, focusing on stability, performance, and extensibility, with a vision to accelerate innovation in the crypto space alongside the open-source community.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can open-source projects like the WTH 1.0 \"reth\" node balance the need for rapid development with maintaining high standards of documentation, testing, and community engagement?\n\n- In what ways do you think the high level of community engagement and diverse contributor base for the WTH project has influenced its development trajectory and overall success?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
