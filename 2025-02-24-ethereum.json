But there was no buffer left so rETH depegged in November, somehow recovered a bit in December, but January and February it got even worse.

But this is the earliest I've attended in the week before so it's interesting to see the Buidl'ing and what is and isn't setup.\n\n  \nFirst presentation I watched was on the Op Superchain by Karl Floersch of Optimism/OP Labs. The overall presentation was to demo the natively interopable devnet and starter kit available on their gist. The goal is to combat the fragmenting of Ethereum that we all deal with by having different funds in different L1s and L2s doing different things; it would also allow for simultaneous contract deployment across those layers to avoid address squatting, and finally the ability to upgrade those contracts without having to upgrade each individually wherever they are deployed. \n\n  \nThe tool allows any chain to read from any other chain with security and low latency, currently a few seconds with the goal to be simultaneous blocks. They even have a block explorer for the devnet. He demoed the tool which was a lot of code that demonstrated a counter across chains, but a lot went beyond my meager programing knowledge. Finally, he championed that it is a green field in crypto development, he was very excited.\n\n  \nSecond was \"Build Cross-Chain Ethereum Applications with ICP Chain Fusion\" by Kristofer Lund of DFINITY. He opened by asking \"Why do we keep asking these rando chains (aka ICP) to EthDenver?\" He then began to champion ICP, which is a separate decentralized L1 that serves fully on chain apps (his words, not mine, I haven't looked into ICP before). He compared ICP to other scaling solutions like Eigen, ZKsync, starknet and more. He seemed to say that ICP has been doing the cross chain thing for years whereas the OP Superchain is new, but they seem to handle things very differently.\n\n  \nThird chat I sat in on was by Timothey Shen of Story, which is building a P2P IP Network. He began by defining the origins of Intellectual Property from centuries ago, and how media has grown by leaps and bounds from books to tv to digital media and now generative AI, yet the basis of IP rules are still medieval. They are trying to build a new framework to bring IP into the current age, answering questions like How to Protect IP and How to claim ownership. They are using the Story L1 to tokenize creativity, make it and IP programable, networkable and liquid, using Proof of Creativity and programable IP licensing. It currently uses a staking mechanism that incentives longer staking, and locks rewards for stakers during the \"singularity\" phase. They decided to make their own L1 because of gas costs on L1 Ethereum and their ability to precompose the required graphs. I did like the tool they showed that allowed someone wanting to create an IP to easily compose a legal framework through visual selection instead of having to hire a lawyer to write a legalese contract. I also thought it was interesting that it will enable the ability to sell IPs, licenses, and royalties as a NFT.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>EthDenver! 1st day for me, I just went for some of the talks in the afternoon as I&#39;m in town for work and not the actual Buidlathon.

Ethereum Core Developers and Blockchain Engineers presented insights on the importance of rollups as scaling solutions to address slow transaction speeds on Layer 1. They explained the concepts of centralized and based sequencing in rollups, emphasizing optimistic and ZK rollups for verifying transaction correctness efficiently. Additionally, the speakers delved into the challenges of integrating pre-conformations for base rollups, the need for rollup inboxes, and designing mechanisms for confirmation receipts. Furthermore, they discussed potential future work such as optimizing block proposal processes, reducing block times, implementing a universal pre-confirmation registry, and exploring varied slashing conditions for ensuring security and integrity within the system.\n\nThe speaker discussed the economics of pre-confirmation and pricing for P-Coms ETC, mentioning talks by Connor Finn and Lynn. The main concern raised was the potential reluctance of relays and builders to adopt the constraint API due to reduced profitability with pre-confirmations. However, there seems to be a positive outlook with many relayers and builders showing agreement to add the constraint API to their pipeline. Additionally, plans for L2 MEV extraction could further impact the dynamics, potentially leading to an L2 PBS pipeline for block extraction. The discussion highlighted the lack of specific latency figures for block transmission from pre-confirmation due to the current setup using Dev Nets and a hybrid solution with the Gateway precom and smart contracts on Hilder.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How might the integration of rollups contribute to addressing the challenge of slow transaction speeds on the Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain, and what are the implications of utilizing optimistic and ZK rollups for verifying transaction correctness efficiently?\n\n\n\n2. What are the potential economic implications of implementing pre-confirmations (P-Coms ETC) in Ethereum transactions, and how might the introduction of L2 MEV extraction impact the profitability and adoption of constraint APIs by relayers and builders?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
