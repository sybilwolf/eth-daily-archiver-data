Just wasn't feeling the top level post, and the daily feels like home. Thanks to u/logristhebard and u/llamachef for also covering their experiences here. This felt like a pretty straightforward conference day.\n\nSpent the morning in the main venue, listened to a handful of talks but I'll note just a few. I've been wanting to get caught up on what people are doing with modern crypto-adjacent AI agents. Seems to be a hot topic. I'm familiar with the big AI labs' efforts towards agentic behavior, and remember earlier efforts, such as AutoGPT, to instigate long-term planning in earlier LLM models. But I don't quite know what makes this new direction different other than having smarter LLMs at the core. Saw a few talks in hopes of learning more:\n\n* [Ali Serag of Flow Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq82_vPv8fY) tried to sell Flow as a platform on which to build agents. I didn't learn a ton about the reasons for today's hype around agents. But I did get an overview of agent structure, which is what I would have guessed: LLM as the \"brain\", API access to social media and other apps as the \"ears, mouth, and hands\", and the private key for a blockchain account as the \"wallet\". I also picked up on a mention of [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza), which seems to be the hip new agent framework (like LangChain?). A good portion of the talk was shilling Flow itself, an alt-L1, where the main selling points today were a lot of features built in natively, like atomic swaps, a flexible permissioning system, and giving transactions different addresses for the proposer, payer, and authorizers.\n* [David Minarsch of Olas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDVK2Q5RY0c) envisions more small but highly-specialized agents participating in a swarm and/or an agent economy. Instead of having a single super-generalist agent try to achieve your desired goals, you'd instead launch a large number of specialized agents whose collective emergent behavior aims to achienve those goals. As a swarm, this would be collaborative with agents loosely coordinating and sharing data. As an agent economy, this would be more competitive, with agents following market dynamics in order to optimize towards the goal. Apparently on Olas you can write contracts which define desired emergent behavior, then launch your tons of small agents and have them optimize towards achieving that behavior.\n\nI could have generally guessed at most of that, still don't quite understand what the current hype is all about, but that's okay. Another talk, which I didn't see, was [Jonathan Meyer of EthStaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8G1LJY-eFQ) reviewing the 2024 staking surveys. I think I've seen all these results already, but if you haven't it may be a good watch. Oh, and for some reason between talks the stages have been displaying an ad for some bitcoin documentary thing. You know, the usual \"legacy financial system is going to implode and only bitcoin can save it\" kind of stuff.\n\nIn the afternoon I moved over to another location for ETHGas's [The Future of Blockspace Markets](https://lu.ma/ETHGasDenver). This was largely about based sequencing and preconfirmations, with the same group of people I've seen at every event since around EthCC last year:\n\n* I caught the tail end of a panel on validator perspectives on preconfs. The most repeated perspectives were 1) that running the [necessary sidecars](https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client) should be as easy as mev-boost is today, and 2) that it's super important to keep the validator set as decentralized as possible.\n* The next panel invited speakers representing three different based rollup teams. Amir of Puffer and Sam of Rise both like based sequencing as a potential solution to ecosystem fragmentation, despite coming from very different perspectives (app chain platform and single super performant L2, respectively). Antony of Spire specifically cited L2 *synchronous composability* as the dream, a very similar standpoint. At this stage in their building, these teams are making some pragmatic decisions, e.g. Puffer transitioned from the Taiko stack to the OP stack for performance reasons, and are using TEEs and gattaca for their sequencing, which is perhaps a temporary compromise.\n* Kevin Lepsoe of ETHGas gave an update on their vision. In short, they want to make a full marketplace for all sorts of blockspace futures. Hopefully going to launch soon with only inclusion preconfs and whole-block markets. But a long list of other goals, including blob market, *ex*clusion preconfs, a \"slow lane\" if you want a discount and are fine waiting 1-4 slots for your transaction to get included, specific state access/locks, and insurance. Kevin suggested that if stakers can sell off all their future blocks far in advance, you minimize reward volatility and can see staking as basically \"fixed rate\".\n* The final panel brought on block builders and potential traders of blockspace futures. On the topic of builder diversity (where we currently only have two dominant builders), Wee Howe of Tokka Labs was hopeful that access to blockspace futures could shake up the builder market, though Kubi of Gattaca doesn't think it'll have too much impact on builder behavior. Everyone is most excited about execution preconfirmations, and possibly the chance to buy and take advantage of multiple blocks in a row (though that's more controversial). Kubi notes that builders get most of their edge from a combination of order flow, latency, and sequencing--noting that they were able to enter the market after order flow was already critical, so it may not be impossible to break up today's duopoly. Benjamin of BTCS is a little more skeptical, noting how today's protocols like CoW Swap are strict gatekeepers of most order flow.\n\nI was glad to see discussion of the ongoing Holesky excitement in the daily, but that's been fun to chat about here in person too. Most recent update is that it seems like the tools and techniques to get synced to the correct chain are becoming more widely available, and the plan is currently try to recover the network rather than scrapping it. Slashing databases are working so those who attested to the wrong chain are being prevented from attesting now, even when synced. But the suggestion is to have everyone disable their slashing db's simultaneously. So hopefully we get enough attestation weight to finalize a new epoch (generally saving the chain) before a large fraction of the network gets slashed for surround votes. Then exit, re-deposit, and the chain lives on. Fun stuff.\n\nMore preconfirmation stuff tomorrow, I think. Other than that, hmmmm. Weather has been warm and lovely. Denver parking is a pain as usual. Stellar rented out the whole aquarium for the night and I got to wander around it for a bit and watch the fish with some Rocket Pool folks.\n\n-----\n\nRelevant Links\n\n* [ETHDenver 2025](https://www.ethdenver.com/)\n* [Talk Video Archive](https://www.youtube.com/@ETHDenver/videos)\n* [Live Streams on Twitch](https://m.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver/home)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver 2025 Day 2</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ixpsfj/austonsts_ethereum_conference_adventures/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Moving back to the daily.

The consistent pattern observed across different phases strengthens our prior, suggesting that the metric has predictive power.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-26 18:27:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mf042oo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iyhpmb","parent_id":"t3_1iyhpmb","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"I think ETFs have completely thrown this cycle off making previous data unreliable","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think ETFs have completely thrown this cycle off making previous data unreliable</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-26 19:32:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mf0f3af","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iyhpmb","parent_id":"t1_mf042oo","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/johnnydappeth","body":"That, and not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the President of the US rugpulling 6-7 years ago.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That, and not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the President of the US rugpulling 6-7 years ago.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-26 19:44:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mf0h4hl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iyhpmb","parent_id":"t1_mf0f3af","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/twilotab","body":"It's been said before, Gensler allowing the ETHETF going through without staking approvals was a big FU at that time, it screwed its sales pitch narrative.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s been said before, Gensler allowing the ETHETF going through without staking approvals was a big FU at that time, it screwed its sales pitch narrative.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-26 20:24:10","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-02-26 20:41:06","id":"mf0n6bw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iyhpmb","parent_id":"t1_mf0f3af","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"Also like-kind redemption which led to the grayscale sell pressure\n\nBut my comment was also in regards to the BTC ETF and microstrategy pulling prices higher faster than normal and","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Also like-kind redemption which led to the grayscale sell pressure</p>\n\n<p>But my comment was also in regards to the BTC ETF and microstrategy pulling prices higher faster than normal and</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-26 21:05:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mf0t40a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iyhpmb","parent_id":"t1_mf0n6bw","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Filibuster69","body":"Why didn't the big ETF issuers already asked for it?

You could even sow conflict by bribing the existing miners with some extra BTC added to their accounts in the new history.\n\nAnd there's no reason it couldn't be attacked over and over and over again, until the only option left is for the Bitcoin Core team to try to convince everyone to hastily go proof-of-stake or proof-of-authority.\n\nYou're right that exchanges would probably recommend everyone follows the old chain head, but not necessarily. Hopefully the miners would give up their bribes to follow it, too, but that I'm less sure about. What I'm very sure about is that everyone's idea of \"finality\" for large transactions on the Bitcoin network would need to be adjusted to a matter of weeks, as Bitcoin Cash was during its 51% attacks.
