Today around 3pm UTC there will be a call to coordinate a mass slashing. Slashing itself is not the goal, but getting just enough validators to attest to finalize an epoch. This would help with the load on the clients. We would lose finality shortly afterwards again, but it might be enough to stabilize the network and remove a lot of load from the clients. In a few weeks we might regain finality due to exiting all the offending validators. I am not 100% sure on the math there as when I estimate it I get several months or even years until we might reach finality again. I might have missed some details in my estimate. Whatever the time scale exactly is, it will again put a lot of strain on the clients we will see how well they handle that. \n\nAs far as I have seen it is clear to most core devs that the approach taken to save holesky is not a viable path if anything like this would happen on mainnet. It is relatively centralized and a testnet, so slashing 80% or so of the validators is not that big of an issue and it is relatively easy to coordinate the rescue operation. So, I would not draw any conclusion from the approach taken here to what might be done on mainnet.\n\nI am still not 100% convinced this is the best way to save holesky, but core devs agreed so I will do my part in it. I was able to sync up to the chain and fired up my validators again. They are doing their job very well. It is quite impressive how the clients improved in just these few days. Lighthouse apparently needed more than 100 GB of RAM just a few days ago to handle the situation. Now I can run Lighthouse semi Stable and it just uses 10-15 GB RAM or so. Will add more RAM to my node in the coming hours just to be on the safe side.\n\nIt looks like I was also rather lucky that I switched off my validators pretty much at the moment when the network started to justify the invalid fork (24th Feb 11:05pm UTC).

Additionally, there's the choice of whether to run one instance of the EVM and try to execute parts of it in parallel, or to run multiple EVMs concurrently and figure out communication between them (which I think is Arcology's approach). They cite a Polygon paper as saying about half of transactions are non-contentious and can be parallelized, and measure 8-14k TPS on maximally parallelized functions.\n* [Redouane Elkamhi of GOAT Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQxJ1ko7HWs) shared their Bitcoin L2. I am not super familiar with what's actually possible to build on Bitcoin, and can't judge the merits of their system. But it appears to be a chain with a sort of dPoS where BTC and DOGE holders (for some reason) are able to stake their coins and allocate their weight to one of multiple sequencers, and in return get a share of the rewards for the blocks that sequencer builds. Network fees are in BTC. They have their own in-house zkVM and BitVM 2 implementations. I'm picking up that competition between future Bitcoin L2 platforms is really ramping up now, and they're all going to have their niches.\n* Danno Ferrin of Team Ipsilon at the EF (video again missing) delivered the State of Ethereum State Address. He covered the different types of data that might take up space on your node (21 TB for an archive node, 1.2 TH for a regular node). Explained fast sync vs snap sync vs full blockchain replay. Then went into the effect that blobs have had, and will continue to have, on total DA throughput and disk usage. Finally, capped things off with EIP-4444 for pruning data >1 year old, likely staring May 1, with a shout out to Portal Network for providing access to pruned historical data.\n* [Illia Polosukhin of NEAR Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPyzVNcQMKw) argued that 2025 will be the year of the agents. They certainly have a lot of hype right now, but a few interesting takes here. AI is the \"final platform shift\", away from humans on siloed apps, to agents interacting with websites, to an internet of agents. AI is also the final stage of chain abstraction. You won't need to know or care where your tokens are stored if your natural-language agent can manage that for you behind the scenes. But of course, we need *user-owned AI* for confidentiality, verifiability, etc. Illia announced an \"open agents alliance\" with a number of the big players in the space, all committing to open standards supporting this vision of user-owned AI.\n\nIn the evening I went to the Pistachio event where JT was serving up his famous BBQ. It was my first time getting to enjoy his cooking, and I liked it enough to take a large dish home with me afterwards. The event also had a Super Smash Bros Ultimate tournament planned, which I was eager to participate in. I ended up winning, and it wasn't particularly close. I felt a little bad kinda?

Official opening started at the Regeneratoor Stage with talks from the founder of EthDenver and others. The theme of Regens was decided on as a way to combat degens and downers in the space, something along those lines. EthDenver continues to be free and will always be, they have a lot of scholarships available as well as all the talks and more. Their $SPORK token is stakeable and last fall they did a distribution of some $50k to those that had staked (I got like $0.50 USDC). But the goal is to increase that distribution this summer to a pool of $420k, and will be based upon amount staked, time staked, attendance, other factors, but the biggest weight will be contributions to building at EthDenver. So I guess that's part of their plan to tackle funding in the future.\n\n\nu/JaredPolis, the Goverenor of Colorado, talked next about how he's supported EthDenver and crypto, pretty much shilling Colorado as one of the best states to be for crypto development and tech (you can pay state taxes and the like in crypto), plus all the nature. Excited for innovation.\n\n\nJoe Lubin of Consensys talked next in a prepared 10 minute speech. Mainly focused on the ecosystem in this chaotic world (econ, gov, etc) and how things aren't as bad looking for Ethereum as well think. He called Ethereum a highly successful \"metropolitan\" chain, with a strong L1 where innovation continues to happen, as well as scaling with L2s and more to increase usage, and efforts continue on defragmenting, parallizing the EVM, pre confs, raising the gas limit, native ZK, and more. He's optimistic about the SEC and other gov changes.\n\n\nSince today was the official start, the main hall with all the stalls of various projects were open (the shilling hall). There's 18,000 people registered this year, which I think is less than last year, and overall there's less overall stalls/booths and more open space. Could be just me though. So I spent my day walking booth to booth learning about projects today, doing my best to talk among the hubbub and people just trying to grab swag.\n\n\nENS can work across chains now if you set it up, and they mentioned you'll soon (next month?) be able to set multiple address on each chain, one as a primary and the like. So I guess I better login and check all that out.\n\n\nFlock.io is one of the many AI projects, focusing on tokenized AI training and validation. So general or specific models can be trained in a decentralized open source\u00a0 manner, and tokens can be used to use those AIs. There was mention of validation in the process that didn't require as much compute as running the AI, which was also an option. In the same vein was akash and I think Kite.AI\n\n\nAnother AI project, Hetu, is focused on specific science AIs, providing scientists and labs tokens to train an AI and be able to use it for their work and allow others to use it.\n\n\nRecall.Network on FileCoin is trying to provide data storage for AI agent training, I think as a place for AI Agents to store their data as they are trained, and that training can be used for a price by other agents to leapfrog ahead in training. It'll also allow for \"staking\" on agents, as in betting on which agents will do better, or that's what I took from it.\n\n\nLast compute-esque project is Fluence, which tokenizes spare cloud compute. They work with datacenters across multiple countries to allow usage of any spare compute, with plans to allow home users to eventually offer up spare compute, again tokenized, this time on an Arb orbit chain. Can get something like 2 VCPU/ 4 GB RAM/25 GB storage for $10 a month, which they say is competitive. Depending on server there is KYC on the frontend, but it all works through smart contracts so that works as well.\n\n\nReserve.org is blockchain style ETFs of a variety of onchain resources, such as the top 12 coins, or defi, or memecoins, that sort of thing. Which I feel is like a project that's been around before, I just can't remember the name.\n\n\nSummer.fi is a decentralized automated investment platform. It allows users to invest and establish their risk tolerance, and it's all managed to do it's best to make them a profit. Similar to a project I heard about and started to use last EthDenver, Exponential.Fi, but they have KYC and can use traditional banking (Exponential had a 1000 USDC inventive for investing 10,000 last year, with that incentive I was up 25% total).\n\n\nThere were at least 3 ZK identity projects, Self Project on Celo, Humanity, and zkVerify. Self uses ZK to allow you to control what data can be seen, for example if in the future instead of showing your ID to purchase alcohol you can someone use the proof to show you are of age and not have to reveal your address. Humanity same deal but using those palm scanners.\n\n\nDigital Spenders Club is debuting a tap to pay card to use as a debit card using your assets on base. It currently has a QR to pay system setup with places like burrito restaurants and a cinema chain. The card itself is also a hardware wallet. They weren't quite ready to hand out yet so I'm hoping to get one tomorrow.\n\n\nThere were two games I stopped at, Forgotten Court Wizards Universe and Clash of Coins, which are browser based MMORPGs that allow anyone to sign up and play with an email address or a wallet, and are trying to incentivize people into using crypto by allowing items, land, etc to be made as NFTs and thus create commerce.\u00a0\n\n\nOne corner has the EtherDome, which was all crystals and mediation and projections, but they also had a maker space to make ESP32 projects like sound detectors that could interact with the blockchain, as instructed by their AI. While there I heard about the launch of a project, purposeforprofit.com, to create affordable housing in the USA, which I think sounds great, but I need to look into it more.\n\n\nCoinbase (or I guess just Base) had two large booths, one for demoing the Developer Kit I wrote about the other day, which when I scanned the QR code seemed pretty intuitive to use even for a n00b and on a phone. The other was more about games, automated AI resumes, and an AI called Freysa that can be your \"digital twin,\" Though in this case not really your digital twin, it just uses a 20 minute quiz to establish a baseline and not like the AI dream of digital twin. Also costs .1 ETH to deploy on base, but it's part of a game to win, I think it's all the various AI twins people create interacting on a social media platform to earn points, so if you can tweak your quiz and profile you might be able to make the AI more likeable.\u00a0\n\n\nI talked to some projects working on bitcoin but I do not have enough knowledge of how that works to understand how they are earning yield by just holding BTC or similar things that were mentioned.\n\n\nTo finish off the day was an awesome hangout! I finally got to meet a bunch of folks from here like u/austonst, u/LogrisTheBard, and u/the-A-word, and other projects I've been involved with like Dappnode.

He (vaguely) attributes this to too many products, lack of use cases, too many meme coins and scams, and so on, but he doesn't dwell on it. He remains bullish on BTC.

SOL/USD looks about break back down through ~130 level (and would be toast). XRP also looks cooked (as per its historical pump n dump record). The bullish anticipation and momentum with the incoming Trump presidency was huge, and it feels like it's starting to become exhausted.

ETH is going through a huge consolidation phase, and while BTC retains the \"institutional asset class\" meme, and with all the speak of sovereign funds etc, I'm not convinced it is \"immune\" from the current drop in momentum. There are lots of reasons institutional money might become cautious or hesitant (they might even consider fundamentals lol!), and if momentum starts swinging the wrong way, increasing highs and \"blow off top\" scenarios may be substantially diminished (or non-existant).
