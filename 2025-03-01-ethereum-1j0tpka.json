Spent a good part of the day listening to talks, and even chatted a little at a couple booths. A few side events today, but of the social \"hang out and eat food\" variety, no talks there.\n\nAmong the talks I watched today:\n\n* [Namik Muduroglu of MegaETH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUF4tVYhCr4) made the argument that block production should be centralized. To MegaETH, consensus is a problem as it leads to performance degradation, and even Solana is expensive at this point. MegaETH splits up its roles over multiple specialized actors, and focuses on what they do best, while offloading the rest elsewhere (EigenDA, ETH L1 settlement). Block production is their focus, and they have the ability to control rotation of the sequencer and plan to have the sequencer \"follow the sun\" so the part of the world currently experiencing economic activity during the work day will alwyas have the sequencer nearby. Goals are 100k TPS and 1 ms (?!) block times.\n* [Anna Kazlauskas of Open Data Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Ktas3YiWY) sees data as a new asset class. Today's LLMs can train on public internet data but there'sa lot of private data they're missing, and apps are doing a better job of blocking off data access. But users always have a right to their own personal data. Vana is a platform where users can contribute that personal data to a shared training set, in a way that's privacy-preserving and provides you with a proof of contribution. On Vana people built customized \"Data DAOS\", each with their own data source, data structure, and token to participate in the DAO.\n* [Sreeram Kannan of EigenLayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDHqX6KMRZU) described EigenLayer as a platform for AI agents. We want verifiable, autonomous agents, and a smart contract would be the ideal place for them, but given that's impractical Sreeram suggested EigenLayer's AVSs are a perfect fit. It's in the name: autonomous verifiable services. A lot of AVSs already exist to provide the sorts of primitives that could be combined to make the ideal agents. Everyone's trying to build platforms for agents this year, it's the big trend. EigenLayer don't seem to be changing their platform to target AI agents, more suggesting that it's already the ideal platform.\n* [Ronen Tamari, Michael Zargham, and Rena O'Brien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5DFYmJzgqw) talked about some of Metagov's recent research on the role of attention economies on governance. How can people actively participate in governance of the commons, and co-govern their own lives, when our attention is so limited? In case studies, they find that many token voting DAOs have intervention systems to allow for action with less token holder attention, because otherwise nothing would get done. A few takeaways they list: design governance with attention in mind, treat unexpected behavior like low participation as feedback, and expect governance design around attention economies to evolve. Successful projects realize it's a social proble, not just technical.\n* [Thiago Silva and Michael Be of Kraken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuZ9NA5i-Y) described their experiences deliberately interviewing North Korean agents applying to their jobs, then analyzing how those interviews go down. It's a fun talk! I think it's pretty obvious actually? Or at least they don't make for very good candidates and I'm surprised they get hired anywhere. But some good notes like ways they stall for time to give their friends more time to formulate responses, use of fake IDs, and little to no knowledge of American culture while claiming to live in Texas. There are apparently some very detailed databases of known DPRK actors, listing email, helping track them down in the future.\n\nThe Rocket Pool meetup in the evening was pretty nice. Mostly hung out with u/KuDeTa , u/jtnichol , and u/the-A-word but got to say hi to plenty of others! Tomorrow I've got some big headline talks I'm looking forward to, and I hope to stop by the hackathon area to see what everyone's been building.\n\n-----\n\nRelevant Links\n\n* [ETHDenver 2025](https://www.ethdenver.com/)\n* [Talk Video Archive](https://www.youtube.com/@ETHDenver/videos)\n* [Live Streams on Twitch](https://m.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver/home)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver 2025 Day 5</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1j01wfu/daily_general_discussion_february_28_2025/mf7v6c1/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>A nice conference day today.

someone sanity-check me and Christine Kim? One of us seems to be definitely misinformed here.\n\nMy understanding of Holesky's degraded state:\n\n* Holesky stakeholders realized that they could gain more by studying the chain failure and trying to repair it naturally than by simply exerting centralized control to reset or revert the chain. At this point, studying the degraded Holesky network is more valuable to stakeholders than restoring it to a fully functional testnet asap. Ethereum's testing capabilities remain robust with the upcoming Sepolia testnet, the upcoming devnet, local testing capabilities, and Holesky still being partially functional for testing purposes in the degraded state anyways. In any case, Holesky becoming fully operational again is a question of when, not if.\n\nChristine's understanding of Holesky's degraded state:\n\n* Holesky's degraded state is \"a major blow to Ethereum\u2019s upgrade testing capabilities\". The failure is so bad that \"there\u2019s a chance [Holesky] may not ever become usable again.\"\n\nMy understanding of Holesky's role in testing:\n\n* A finalizing Holesky testnet isn't essential to staking providers in terms of testing their smart contracts. Smart contract development consists 99% of local testing, but for that last 1%, they can work with the non-finalizing testnet in its degraded state, they can wait and use the Sepolia testnet or the upcoming Pectra devnet, or they can simply delay their mainnet adoption of Pectra features.

The December community proposal for an unsafe block size limit increase was not \"narrowly avoided\" - it was caught well before any significant amount of stakers started signaling for it - and because it's a command-line setting in the hands of stakers, it's completely unrelated to the discussion about Ethereum's development speed/safety.

One of us seems to be definitely misinformed here.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of Holesky&#39;s degraded state:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Holesky stakeholders realized that they could gain more by studying the chain failure and trying to repair it naturally than by simply exerting centralized control to reset or revert the chain. At this point, studying the degraded Holesky network is more valuable to stakeholders than restoring it to a fully functional testnet asap. Ethereum&#39;s testing capabilities remain robust with the upcoming Sepolia testnet, the upcoming devnet, local testing capabilities, and Holesky still being partially functional for testing purposes in the degraded state anyways.

I'll take XRP as the altcoin of choice for this explanation:\n\nXRP is easy to pump. The vast majority of the coins (80%) are held by a few wallets, and the small supply that's left is bought by a very different type of investor than ETH investors. And there are two flavors of typical XRP investors. The first type just throws a couple hundred thousand/millions in the coin and forgets about it, because they are rich, old, technologically illiterate people that saw XRP in online propaganda videos and it's just play money to them. The second type of XRP investor is completely financially illiterate, invests $20 through Robinhood, and hopes for 1000x. These two types of investors might look completely dissimilar, but they have two key similarities. One, **they don't really leverage**, because they either don't know how to do it, or they don't care. Two, **they won't really cash out on a 10x or even 50x pump.** The first type doesn't need the money, and the second type needs 1000x. As a result, any gains from inflows tend to stay in the XRP ecosystem and the price is largely controlled by Ripple with occasional pump/dumps that allow them to both cash out and build hype for the next cycle.\n\nETH, on the other hand, has a different type of investor. It's mostly nerds like us, more financially literate, \"book smart\", and generally more \"middle-class\". We see the value in the network and invest a respectable amount that is economically significant to us. But we also see the potential of Ethereum, we realize we are smarter/more financially literate than the rest, and **we leverage/take higher risks**. As a result, there is a lot more leverage piling on ETH, with expectations of eventual breakout. There is also a lot more leverage in the form of DeFi collateral. Exchanges see this (it's all on chain or on exchange logs) and know that they can just crash it every few months with precise manipulation and make billions. This means that the beneficiary from ETH volatility is not an overseeing foundation with interests at least aligned to those of the holders, but neutral/parasitic exchanges, who drain a few billion from ETH holders every few months. This slowly drains ETH from adopters and investors, and any new ones arriving are not enough to support the price before they themselves do the same mistakes. Add on top of that that the more \"financially literate\" **ETH investor would start to cash out on a 3x or a 4x**, and all the price action makes perfect sense.\n\nThe ETH market action is entirely predictable and does what anyone would expect: it keeps crabbing, bleeding value to market makers, and bleeding in all ratios vs other altcoins. And it will keep doing that forever, as it *is* a valuable asset, but with all financial interests going against it significantly appreciating.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't really see a way out of this for Ethereum. We would all have to change our behavior at the same time, and game theory dictates that the ones that do not change their behavior come out on top. So we won't do that. Binance-Coinbase-Wintermute will continue to drain Ethereum's blood like thirsty vampires, every Sunday, like clockwork, forever.\n\n*Addendum: I think my theory above makes sense not only for the ETH/XRP action, but also for the general \"inverse\" behavior we see in the crypto markets, where many tokens that are considered \"good coins\" by the most active crypto subreddits severely under-perform, and other coins that are terrible in comparison or pure memecoins, over-perform. They just have the above types of investors in different ratios, leading to the observed bizarre market behavior in different degrees.\n\n*Addendum 2: I think the strength of Bitcoin is that while both types of investors throw some money in it, it somehow keeps the positives of both and avoids the negatives of them.

I&#39;ll take XRP as the altcoin of choice for this explanation:</p>\n\n<p>XRP is easy to pump. The vast majority of the coins (80%) are held by a few wallets, and the small supply that&#39;s left is bought by a very different type of investor than ETH investors. And there are two flavors of typical XRP investors. The first type just throws a couple hundred thousand/millions in the coin and forgets about it, because they are rich, old, technologically illiterate people that saw XRP in online propaganda videos and it&#39;s just play money to them. The second type of XRP investor is completely financially illiterate, invests $20 through Robinhood, and hopes for 1000x. These two types of investors might look completely dissimilar, but they have two key similarities. One, <strong>they don&#39;t really leverage</strong>, because they either don&#39;t know how to do it, or they don&#39;t care. Two, <strong>they won&#39;t really cash out on a 10x or even 50x pump.</strong> The first type doesn&#39;t need the money, and the second type needs 1000x. As a result, any gains from inflows tend to stay in the XRP ecosystem and the price is largely controlled by Ripple with occasional pump/dumps that allow them to both cash out and build hype for the next cycle.</p>\n\n<p>ETH, on the other hand, has a different type of investor. It&#39;s mostly nerds like us, more financially literate, &quot;book smart&quot;, and generally more &quot;middle-class&quot;. We see the value in the network and invest a respectable amount that is economically significant to us.

Add on top of that that the more &quot;financially literate&quot; <strong>ETH investor would start to cash out on a 3x or a 4x</strong>, and all the price action makes perfect sense.</p>\n\n<p>The ETH market action is entirely predictable and does what anyone would expect: it keeps crabbing, bleeding value to market makers, and bleeding in all ratios vs other altcoins.
