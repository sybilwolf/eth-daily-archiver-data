I don't feel as burned out as I sometimes do at the end of a long week, but in part that's because I didn't push it as hard as I sometimes do. Still not a ton of time to just laze around, but not hopping from event to event at a crazy pace either.

It's exactly what you'd all expect, so no need for too much depth. Ethereum doesn't scale, Vitalik's research isn't good any more, blobs aren't scaling fast enough, solo stakers should all go away, only the most performant clients should be allowed, L2 thesis is wrong and anyone who thinks otherwise is stupid because monolithic scaling works and Solana is going to hit one million TPS. I appreciate some of his previous technical insights but don't see why he's being given prime stage time at Ethereum conferences any more.\n* [Kaan and Grant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_oof2kK8hk) gave an overview of the Argot Collective, a spinout from the EF intended to house core Ethereum open source projects. Mostly languages (Solidity/Fe) and verification tools. It's currently 25 people still as a mostly-independent group within the EF but the goal is to complete spinning out by Q2. Most of the talk was about their governance structure and day to day operations, which is kind of interesting but nothing earthshaking. I would have liked to hear a little more about how this move fits into the broader picture of what's happening at the EF and if their autonomy at all changes the way their projects will be handled, but that wasn't quite the point today.\n* [Danny Ryan, now of Etherealize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4VmDitYB2w), gave one of the more productive and optimistic talks about the future of Ethereum. In Danny's time away, the world has changed, and he now sees Wall St as being ready to adopt blockchain tools. But people tend to expect the EF to do things that are actually outside its scope, and that leaves something of a vacuum in the gap in between. So he wants to make Etherealize the place that institutions and governments can go to figure out real adoption. And on the other hand, he wants to help Ethereum step up to fill the void of what people really need. Ethereum should focus on real decentralized systems and real value for real people as much as possible. He stated his support for the L2 roadmap, while noting we could still turn up the dial on L1 somewhat.\n* [Elias Tazartes of Kakarot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b--qg5o8muY) talked about the process towards Ethereum as a ZK-L1. Ethereum is moving more towards a model with duties split between heavy lifting with ZK proofs, and the decentralized validator network who verifies those proofs. To realize the full vision, we need to get proof generation down to below the slot time. Many steps involved, first with prover input generation (ZK-PIG), ideally 0-1 s but currently 1-2 mins with a remote RPC. Next is proving the state transition function, ideally <3s, today 2 min but can be parallelized down to 30 s. Then propagate the proof, which we know how to do but they're pretty heavy at a few MB each. Check out ethproofs.org for current status.\n* [Muriel M\u00e9dard of Optimum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mlkf-wTTDE) has a new model for decentralized memory for the world computer. The Web3 stack mostly maps onto the classic Von Neumann architecture model, particularly on the compute side. But our equivalents of a \"bus\" (e.g. gossip network) and \"memory\" (e.g. chain history) don't map on as well, and are pretty big limiting factors for scaling. So restructure those to make it look more like a classic computer. For the bus, they want to use random linear network coding for gossip. Now that I think about it, I don't see how RLNC makes gossip more \"bus-like\" but it is more efficient so that's cool. Didn't quite understand what they're doing for \"memory\" but they're wrapping it all up in their Optimum product.\n\nTomorrow I'm actually joining in a hike up Mt Elbert, and need to start driving at 4:30 in the morning. So I'm writing this up earlier in the evening and am not sure when exactly I'll be posting it tomorrow. But for now I need some sleep. I won't be missing out on too much at the conference, as Sunday is usually short and mostly focused on wrapping things up.\n\n-----\n\nI did want to quickly copy-paste the list of the top-three hackathon projects from each track out of a recent announcement on Discord. The one fun thing on Sunday I would have liked to do is watching each team present their project, but for now these links are the best I can do for you all. Let me know if any of them seem particularly interesting.\n\n**Infrastructure + Scalability**\n\n* Gas Killer - https://devfolio.co/projects/gas-killer-2c63\n* Batch'd - https://devfolio.co/projects/batchd-678a\n* Baseline - https://devfolio.co/projects/baseline-16c5\n\n**Impact + Public Goods**\n\n* FaceBuddy - https://devfolio.co/projects/facebuddy-0154\n* Ethical Fish - https://devfolio.co/projects/ethical-fish-0192\n* Action Item - https://devfolio.co/projects/action-item-5ce3\n\n**DeFi + NFT + Gaming**\n\n* SecurePool - https://devfolio.co/projects/securepool-26c0\n* Bot Or Not: Turing Test - https://devfolio.co/projects/bot-or-not-turing-test-6bd8\n* 0xCaliber - https://devfolio.co/projects/xcaliber-83cd\n\n**DAOs + Community**\n\n* Xao - https://devfolio.co/projects/xao-e6f8\n* SEELE - https://devfolio.co/projects/seele-3477\n* Pollination Station - https://devfolio.co/projects/pollination-station-5de5\n\n**Identity, Privacy + Security**\n\n* Ultra Anon - https://devfolio.co/projects/ultra-anon-9f12\n* Wingman - https://devfolio.co/projects/wingman-6cfb\n* zkHotdog \ud83c\udf2d\ud83d\udccf\u2705 - https://devfolio.co/projects/zkhotdog-7dd3\n\n-----\n\nRelevant Links\n\n* [ETHDenver 2025](https://www.ethdenver.com/)\n* [Talk Video Archive](https://www.youtube.com/@ETHDenver/videos)\n* [Live Streams on Twitch](https://m.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver/home)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver 2025 Day 6</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1j0tpka/daily_general_discussion_march_01_2025/mfea9qg/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The last full conference day at ETHDenver!

The protocol authenticates users, verifies proofs on-chain, and addresses issues with traditional proof of identity solutions.

Ram compared Halo 2 and Noir for benchmarking, highlighting their efficiency and open-sourced code for further exploration. Plans for real-world implementation and potential collaborations with other projects were also mentioned.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How might the use of the Anon protocol impact the way digital identity is managed and authenticated for Indian citizens, particularly in terms of privacy protection and efficiency compared to traditional solutions?\n\n\n\n2. In what ways could collaborations with other projects enhance the real-world implementation of the Anon protocol, and what specific benefits or challenges might arise from such partnerships in the context of protecting user privacy and ensuring secure identity verification?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

From there you could say well we should add Sol, ADA, XRP, etc.. because they have growing ecosystems and follow some similar value propositions to ETH.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-02 15:27:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mfovtx5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1j1l1st","parent_id":"t3_1j1l1st","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-02 07:59:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mfmei6s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1j1l1st","parent_id":"t3_1j1l1st","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProfStrangelove","body":"Yeah I wouldn't be surprised to get another post which mentions eth\n\nSo they can rotate some gains and capitalize another time\n\n\nEdit: called it\n\nEasiest buy of eth ever for me","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to get another post which mentions eth</p>\n\n<p>So they can rotate some gains and capitalize another time</p>\n\n<p>Edit: called it</p>\n\n<p>Easiest buy of eth ever for me</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-02 08:13:26","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-03-02 08:46:53","id":"mfmh8h1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1j1l1st","parent_id":"t1_mfmei6s","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/maninthecryptosuit","body":"Spot on","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Spot on</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-02 09:30:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mfmx1q3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1j1l1st","parent_id":"t1_mfmh8h1","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"If this would go through, BTC will keep getting influx from the institutional investors and MSTR.
