This unknown application scares me more that the uphill tech solution climb. Seeing Danny speak about filling the gap between where Ethereum is and what orgs need to use Ethereum as a solution seems like an important acknowledgement.  Yes, people in our community have barked about this gap, but it seems to finally getting some traction with people that have the stroke to make something happen.

The tool operates with the functionality to work with distinct configurations and even addresses specific integration needs for platforms like Foundry. Additionally, the tool features a capabilities map that includes reference graph visualization, inheritance graph representation, and detailed annotations for functions. The wake tool is ideal for managing and analyzing software projects efficiently, offering diverse functionalities such as compiling codebases, handling configurations, and visualizing code relationships.\n\nThe speaker discussed creating reference and inheritance graphs for function calls and inheritance in Ethereum projects, highlighting the benefits of their tools over existing options.

The tool operates with the functionality to work with distinct configurations and even addresses specific integration needs for platforms like Foundry. Additionally, the tool features a capabilities map that includes reference graph visualization, inheritance graph representation, and detailed annotations for functions. The wake tool is ideal for managing and analyzing software projects efficiently, offering diverse functionalities such as compiling codebases, handling configurations, and visualizing code relationships.</p>\n\n<p>The speaker discussed creating reference and inheritance graphs for function calls and inheritance in Ethereum projects, highlighting the benefits of their tools over existing options.
