They emphasize user convenience by providing features like Pass Key for wallet creation and a fund recovery mechanism.

The price growth will offset the reduction in block rewards.\n\nLet's do some basic maths here. Let's assume you're correct and this means that Bitcoin doubles every 4 years to offset the block reward decrease. Let's assume Bitcoin is currently at $80,000. Between now and 2060, there will be 9 more halvings. So $80K times 2 at the next halving in 2028 is: $160K\n\nLet's keep this going.\n\n2032: $320K\n\n2036: $640K\n\n2040: $1.28M\n\n2044: $2.56M\n\n2048: $5.12M\n\n2052: $10.24M\n\n2056: $20.48M\n\n2060: $40.96M - $8 Quadrillion market cap - compare this to the US stock market's current valuation of $25T and the estimate of all financial assets (not including real estate) and fiat in the world of about $200T.\n\nKeep in mind that this is ***not*** factoring in for inflation. Because the security budget is paying miners, they don't care about the value of dollars. They have electric and ASIC production bills to pay.\n\nSo what you're telling me, is that you think the current mining budget of $10B will secure a $8 quadrillion dollar market cap? Not a chance.\n\nThis will be a real problem much sooner too. Again, assuming you're right, by 2036 we'll be looking at $10B annually securing $13T. That's great value for money if you can either double spend even a small fraction of that $13T or if your adversary (eg. China or USA) owns 5% of that $13T and you own nothing, you can destroy a huge amount of their wealth with a minimal contribution of 51% of the mining hash power ($10B worth).\n\n>BTC is akin to gold and it won\u2019t be used for simple payments.

The confirmation times would be absurd due to the low security budget and significant incentives to re-org blocks. More info on that here in this research paper. https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/mining_CCS.pdf\n\n>I also think compute-power is going to become cheaper and cheaper in the future.\n\nThis in no way increases security because everyone has access to said hash power or at least a similar level of hash power on a per dollar basis.\n\n>There will be many hundreds of thousands of entities that hold BTC as a reserve asset that will want to secure the chain even if it brings no monetary gain.\n\nOr they could just not hold BTC and therefore not have to bleed money every year mining to secure their bags at a more expensive rate than it cose them to keep the gold in Fort Know secure. This is a pipe dream.\n\n>Also, if a single entity wanted to 51% attack the network, they would have to buy-up so much physical hardware that it would be impossible.\n\nIf you're TSMC or the Chinese government it would be pretty trivial to put aside a proportion of advanced ASICs as they're made and then a year later use it to attack the network.

On the other hand, if China has 51% of the hash power there really isn't much you can do. They can continually attack the network.
