There are many vaults and products that accomplish this in various ways, but the one Ive settled on is a product called **Tokemak** (https://app.tokemak.xyz/) that I feel obligated to share my research on. Security audits viewable here: https://docs.tokemak.xyz/developer-docs/security-and-audits\n\nTokemaks newer v2 AutoPools are basically set-it-and-forget-it liquidity vaults that actively manage assets for yield optimization. Instead of users needing to manually rebalance positions or track shifting incentives, AutoPools automate the process with daily rebalances and DAO based yield voting strategies. The core value prop here is simplifying liquidity provision while improving capital efficiency. you deposit assets into an AutoPool (and receive a LAT token in return), and Tokemak handles the rest\u2014dynamically adjusting exposure across different venues automagically. The yields come from the yields of the underlying tokens (mostly LSTs), fees from the LPs they are deployed to, and any other incentives etc. In general, it seems yields are around 2-4x normal staking yields or higher, paid out in ETH (and optionally, you can stake your LAT token to receive their protocol token TOKE for additional yields. This obviously fluctuates reguarly based on the ever shifting yield markets.\n\n**Usability:** The flow of use is very smooth, and I'm pretty impressed by how easy the protocol is to understand and use. Each autopool shows exactly how much and of what position they hold, with daily re-balances also shown without even needing to connect a wallet. You deposit whatever asset (Doesnt matter which, the deposit has built in swapping features so it will swap whatever youre depositing and then redistribute to its underlying allocations in a single transaction + approval). Once deposited, you instantly get metrics like estimated daily rewards etc.\n\n**Payouts/APR:** The APR and payouts are all denominated in ETH, and the protocol seems entirely focused on getting good raw ETH returns in a minimally risky way, plus some of their protocol token. You can see the exact breakdowns on their APR in each pools, and it shifts every few days to reflect current rates etc. For example their Base autopool (BASEETH) is currently yielding 11.75% APR in ETH, plus a paltry .36% TOKE yields (its low because the yield is from token buybacks, and this pool has low TVL so low buybacks.. so in theory the more TVL each pool gets, the higher the TOKE rewards ontop of whatever underlying yield they are getting, Clever). They are going to release a Stablecoin version of their autopools in early April, which they hope will attract more TVL to help the TOKE price. I'm not interested in TOKE though, and it seems to be a small part of their overall yield. I was happy getting 8% on LSTs, and the bonus TOKE is just that... A bonus.\n\n**Withdrawals:** This part has gotta be the best bit. Instant withdrawals from your position, with no holds, wait time or additional fees. You choose which asset you get back from the pool, even if its not part of the pool (withdrawal has built in swaps). slippage as low as .01%, Ive tested withdrawals a few times and always get almost exactly the estimates back. No fees to withdraw. Unstaking the position is also a single transaction to do, with no lockup. From fully staked LAT token to raw eth is 2 transactions and less then 1 minute. When you withdraw from the pool, it automatically sells some of the LP assets to fund your withdrawal, starting with the LOWEST YIELDING asset in the pool. Often this is raw ETH from recent deposits or a very stable LST like RETH, so not only does it seem to minimally affect the pool, your risk of IL seems much lower.\n\n**Fees:** The protocol charges 10% of the yields profits, which goes to the DAO and is then used to do token buybacks on the TOKE token, which doesnt have emmisions, and is nearly fully circulated (minus 20% locked in their treasury). the TOKE that is paid out to stakers is purchased from the open market using the 10% fee structure within the pools and distributed to stakers, creating a flywheel effect which.. is pretty interesting to me (though personally I dont believe the token will ever be worth anything again, its still a neat attempt at doing so.). This token and protocol have been around since last cycle, but their new autopilot product is whats suddenly made it interesting to me. Very fair fees, considering how much utility you get.\n\n**Risks:** The major risks in this protocol are a depeg of the underlying assets within each autopool creating conditions in which a withdrawal will give you less ETH then expected until those assets repeg, plus a few extra layers of smart contract risk. Yield farming is a lot riskier in general then raw staking, since you have many layers of smart contracts (Tokemak, Curve, Balancer, Each individual LST etc etc) vs just one or two. There is also the risk that the autopool gets drained of its underlying in a hack, in which case I assume everyone gets wrecked. They do however have audits for each product they release (Hexens, mostly), and such audits are publicly available.. you decide your own tolerance for risk in this space.. but as far as can be seen - these guys seem ontop of it and use primarily heavily vetted protocols for their autopool allocations.\n\nI have ended up putting more then half of my long term held ETH into these pools, in hopes of riding out the coming bad years while still generating a pretty aggressive yield - with the ability to achieve long term capital gains for better taxable results down the line when I exit bits here and there to TRY and supplement income.

The reality is that governments and big banks have captured crypto, and Ethereum may have sidelined itself as a result. Yes, Larry Fink says the the future is tokenization but the market seems to either not care at all or that it won\u2019t be Ethereum leading the charge.</p>\n\n<p>So, where does Ethereum go from here? The Ethereum Foundation doesn\u2019t seem focused on price narratives, and I don\u2019t expect that to change whatsoever in the slightest. While extremely frustrating as a long time participant and investor, it is what it is. Does that mean the burden falls on a late-to-start Etherealize? If so, it feels like time is running out. That initiative should have started years ago and likely before PoS even went live.</p>\n\n<p>What I once believed would be Ethereum\u2019s greatest strength\u2014an unwavering cypherpunk core\u2014now feels like one of its greatest weaknesses. If this was in fact the intended approach, Ethereum should have sucked it up and marketed itself as such. The lack of communication and marketing is astonishing and infuriating to be honest. I don\u2019t even know what the post is about other than trying to make sense of how weak Ethereum feels. We could have had it all.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-11 05:55:32","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-03-11 06:06:17","id":"mh719pr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1j8k469","parent_id":"t3_1j8k469","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/vlatkovr","body":">The reality is that governments and big banks have captured crypto\n\nBut the big banks and other fintech companies are actually building on Ethereum.
