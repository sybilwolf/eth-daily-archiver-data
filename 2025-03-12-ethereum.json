We kind of lost our way in thinking the value of ETH is not important for the succes of the blockchain once again. We are slowly realizing it again, and we are on the verge of understanding that protecting the value of ETH is perhaps the most important aspect of Ethereum succeeding. I\u2019m looking with joy as we are moving back to that initial idea, with several big players trying to bolster the social layer. The ticker is ETH.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-12 03:07:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mhczhp4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1j9cuge","parent_id":"t3_1j9cuge","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Filibuster69","body":"ETH's value is the most important paramerer in Ethereum because in a proof of stake world your economic security depends on it.
