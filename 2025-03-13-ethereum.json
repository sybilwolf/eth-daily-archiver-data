They go through what happened on the testnets and what it means going forward.\n\nThe takeaway is 'testnets are for breaking'. They add a lot of nuance to this statement, but that is how they look at it. They mention that for every one of the last few Ethereum upgrades they broke at least one if not all of the testnets. I was not aware of that. Something that changed is that the testnets are now much more used than they were 2 years ago.

They go through what happened on the testnets and what it means going forward.</p>\n\n<p>The takeaway is &#39;testnets are for breaking&#39;. They add a lot of nuance to this statement, but that is how they look at it. They mention that for every one of the last few Ethereum upgrades they broke at least one if not all of the testnets. I was not aware of that. Something that changed is that the testnets are now much more used than they were 2 years ago.

Some time ago people even said that no investor can make money from Linux. That is provably wrong. For example, if you bought Red Hat stocks 20 years ago, you would have made more money than if you bought Microsoft stocks back then. Not by much, but the growth was higher. Interestingly after pointing out that a lot of Linux companies are very profitable the 'Ethereum is Linux' narrative shifted a bit. Now it switched to Red Hat is like base and stuff like that. The analogies make less and less sense, at least to me. \n\nIn my view, Linux has pretty much won in every category, except the personal PC. Interestingly the Personal PC category has been marginalized in its importance with the advent of smart phones and tablets. But even on the PC, Microsoft now provides a one click install a full fledged Linux within Windows itself, called 'Windows Subsystem for Linux'.

Everyone interacts with a Linux machine all the time. Either directly or one step removed through the Routers, switches or servers they use. Now imagine that each usage of such a Linux box costs a tiny amount of money. Just imagine how much money would flow back to Linux. If you think Ethereum is the Linux of blockchains then no matter how small these fees are the usage will be so massive that there will be a huge amount of money flowing back to the Linux of blockchains. That is exactly what Ethereum is going towards. It is the only blockchain which has a scaling plan that can actually work in the long term. Everyone who is at least a little bit serious is building on top of Ethereum and they, or their users pay a little bit to Ethereum for every interaction. Currently, these use cases are still small and in some cases only possible since the introduction of blobs last year, so there is not much value flowing back just yet. The blob supply shock also drove prices for rollups pretty low, which is great as rollups can now experiment with different setups and expand their user base for cheap. There is a clear plan to grow the supply and there is a lot of interest by companies to build on top of it which shows that the demand is coming as well.

People often think we are greedy or Eth is greedy. No L2s are Eth all of the profit should flow to Eth. Ofcourse I am just spitballing could be 1 cent could be 50 cent idk. But I for one dont care if its 1 cent or 10 cent it really doesnt matter anymore at sub 1 dollar to me. So lets say others are 10x more price sensitive.

I also qualified it with the only thing left to hype for BTC was an ETF approval. What has played out over the last year and a half was not a proper crypto bull market like the past but rather a few players leveraged and borrowed billions upon billions to prop up BTC and continue the \"digital gold, buy now\" narrative and hype, all the while lobbying politicians, media, etc.. to further the hype train. Some of these same players shorted ETH as a hedge mind you, but that is besides the point. Some money did come in from ETFs and the political and regulatory environment should be more favorable going forward, but the HYPE behind those things is what drove prices up more so than the actual events.\n\nThe problem is 99%+ of the global wealth DOES NOT believe in crypto as an investment at this point. There was no one left to buy BTC at higher and higher prices cause why buy it? The last ditch attempt to get the US government to buy and hype failed. The narrative around BTC is at best \"digital gold\" but it seems at times more like \"buy it because someone else might buy it higher\" and that only gets you so far. They have completely abandoned any goal for building and improving the use cases, tech, utility, security, etc... I don't mind BTC as I think it is cool on some level, but I am highly against it being the flagship asset in this space that leads bull markets. I think it is detrimental for BTC to continue to be such a huge focus. 2021 was a proper bull market with much more of a focus on the potential of the asset class, the innovative underlying tech, and overall pitch to the those outside of crypto to come and join.\n\nIt has been very frustrating to watch the likes of SOL, XRP, etc.. make runs while ETH stayed flat, but these assets do not really function like ETH, nor have the same focus as Ethereum. They have some central players that prop up their asset and hoard a lot of the supply. They are much easier to manipulate the market higher with a small amount of funds and marketing. It remains to be seen but these assets may very well give up most of their gains as the tide goes out.\n\nETH is functioning as a proper asset and in some ways is the LEAST manipulated. It is the asset that objectively has the most legitimacy of anything in this space, even more so than BTC. There are natural buyers and sellers of ETH at all times. It is used as capital. It's used as currency. Its a productive asset. It truly is a triple point asset. Unfortunately this has not translated into price appreciation these past few years cause as I mentioned before 99%+ of the global wealth does not believe in crypto at this point. The vast majority of money coming in these last few years has been fanatical and leveraged BTC buyers or traders/investors looking for big short to medium term gains, which favor smaller market cap assets. Imo the biggest opportunity for ETH over other assets is that ETH will do really well if we can convince the other 99%+ of global wealth to make real investments and build in this space. Potentially exponentially greater returns for ETH over other assets if that were to happen.\n\nI think damage has been done to crypto's image over the last year. I am once again here in 2025 saying the same thing \"The next bull market will be led by ETH and Ethereum or the next bull market doesn't happen\". I would like to see Ethereum continue to build and reach out to others. We need to make it easier and easier for those outside of here to see the positives and potential in this space. There is so much to be excited about with Ethereum going forward. I do believe in the long run (looks longer now than before) ETH will do well.

I also qualified it with the only thing left to hype for BTC was an ETF approval. What has played out over the last year and a half was not a proper crypto bull market like the past but rather a few players leveraged and borrowed billions upon billions to prop up BTC and continue the &quot;digital gold, buy now&quot; narrative and hype, all the while lobbying politicians, media, etc.. to further the hype train. Some of these same players shorted ETH as a hedge mind you, but that is besides the point. Some money did come in from ETFs and the political and regulatory environment should be more favorable going forward, but the HYPE behind those things is what drove prices up more so than the actual events.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is 99%+ of the global wealth DOES NOT believe in crypto as an investment at this point. There was no one left to buy BTC at higher and higher prices cause why buy it? The last ditch attempt to get the US government to buy and hype failed. The narrative around BTC is at best &quot;digital gold&quot; but it seems at times more like &quot;buy it because someone else might buy it higher&quot; and that only gets you so far.

The thematic messages of vigilance, skepticism, and thoroughness permeated the discussion to enhance the security posture of blockchain systems.\n\nThe talk emphasized the importance of reading code to identify bugs and vulnerabilities in Ethereum blockchain technologies. The speakers highlighted the significance of looking for clues in the code and documentation, as most protocols are open-source and have verified sources. They encouraged developers and security researchers to focus on security from the beginning of the coding process and to continuously test for bugs using various tools like fuzzing, static analysis tools, and bug bounty platforms. Additionally, they discussed the history of issues in the ERC20 standard related to token loss in smart contracts, which led to significant financial losses for users due to flaws in handling transactions in contracts not designed to receive tokens.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nHow can the practice of thinking like an attacker enhance the security posture of blockchain systems, and what strategies can developers employ to adopt this mindset effectively?\n\n\n\nDiscuss the impact of past issues in the ERC20 standard on the overall security and trustworthiness of blockchain technologies.

Now you name actual properties - simple, decentralized, PoW, no premine, resistant to changes. The problem is most of these properties are actually muddled or outright negatives, if you look at them with an objective eye:\n\n\n- decentralization/PoW: bitcoin is overwhelmingly mined by a couple mining conglomerates using giant warehouses. These are easy targets, not resistant to nation state attacks. The modern bitcoin strategy has been to lobby governments (fragile approach) rather than be government-resistant (antifragile approach). It works here and now. But it's not a hard physical guarantee longterm, which is what you'd want in a store of value.\n\n\nOn top of that, PoW implies constant costs on the network and holders, to the tune of billions of dollars per year. Coupled with the halvings, bitcoin's security budget will be a problem within a few years. This has been explained in great detail by better people, so I'd encourage you to search for \"bitcoin security budget\" rather than provide my own inferior explanation.\n\n\n- no premine/resistant to changes: Satoshi's coins are Schroedinger's premine, and this will pose a problem when upgrades against quantum attacks are needed.\n\n\nIn contrast, compare with Ethereum:\n\n\n- quantum ready, with a plan to upgrade\n\n\n- can and has in the past reached 0 issuance, no negative sum burden to the network\n\n\n- explicitely avoids lobbying governments (resulting in great pain right now, but inevitably better for longterm resilience)\n\n\nOur biggest problem is the 70% premine, which has been smoothed out by years of PoW... and years of the Foundation dumping (which, ironically, people complain about). This is the remaining point where subjectivity can play a role; but there's no doubt our vectors are better aligned, towards minimization; whereas bitcoin's vectors are misaligned, with holders begging for entities like Saylor or the US government to acquire an increasingly high stake.\n\n\nWhen you look at it plainly, it's obvious ETH is the better store of value *and pays the price of bitcoin's aggressive lobbying/marketing/cult power*. Leading to the impression crypto=bitcoin in most people's minds.\n\n\nYou've got to think of bitcoin not just as a pet rock, but as a cancer, a mind virus actively stopping Ethereum's properties for being seen as they are.

Now you name actual properties - simple, decentralized, PoW, no premine, resistant to changes. The problem is most of these properties are actually muddled or outright negatives, if you look at them with an objective eye:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>decentralization/PoW: bitcoin is overwhelmingly mined by a couple mining conglomerates using giant warehouses. These are easy targets, not resistant to nation state attacks. The modern bitcoin strategy has been to lobby governments (fragile approach) rather than be government-resistant (antifragile approach). It works here and now. But it&#39;s not a hard physical guarantee longterm, which is what you&#39;d want in a store of value.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On top of that, PoW implies constant costs on the network and holders, to the tune of billions of dollars per year. Coupled with the halvings, bitcoin&#39;s security budget will be a problem within a few years. This has been explained in great detail by better people, so I&#39;d encourage you to search for &quot;bitcoin security budget&quot; rather than provide my own inferior explanation.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>no premine/resistant to changes: Satoshi&#39;s coins are Schroedinger&#39;s premine, and this will pose a problem when upgrades against quantum attacks are needed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In contrast, compare with Ethereum:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>quantum ready, with a plan to upgrade</p></li>\n<li><p>can and has in the past reached 0 issuance, no negative sum burden to the network</p></li>\n<li><p>explicitely avoids lobbying governments (resulting in great pain right now, but inevitably better for longterm resilience)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our biggest problem is the 70% premine, which has been smoothed out by years of PoW... and years of the Foundation dumping (which, ironically, people complain about). This is the remaining point where subjectivity can play a role; but there&#39;s no doubt our vectors are better aligned, towards minimization; whereas bitcoin&#39;s vectors are misaligned, with holders begging for entities like Saylor or the US government to acquire an increasingly high stake.</p>\n\n<p>When you look at it plainly, it&#39;s obvious ETH is the better store of value <em>and pays the price of bitcoin&#39;s aggressive lobbying/marketing/cult power</em>. Leading to the impression crypto=bitcoin in most people&#39;s minds.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve got to think of bitcoin not just as a pet rock, but as a cancer, a mind virus actively stopping Ethereum&#39;s properties for being seen as they are. Once we cut off the cancer, the current mispricing we&#39;re living through is bound to go away. &gt;~95% of all dollars into BTC are meant to be into ETH, basically.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-13 13:26:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mhmnduh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ja5dmp","parent_id":"t1_mhm9q6a","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/cryptOwOcurrency","body":"I think you're confusing two different things. BTC has indeed won the store of value niche, but that doesn't mean it has the best store of value properties. This is much like Facebook has won the social media network niche, but it doesn't have the best social media network properties. Or how email has won the digital letter niche, despite being an objectively awful and inefficient protocol.\n\nSo your list of positive aspects of BTC are not reasons that BTC is a better store of value; they are post hoc justifications for why BTC won the store of value *niche*. Technically inferior first-movers often win the adoption war, it's just the way the world works.\n\nIt's true that no coin may be able to best BTC as a store of value any time soon, but that's due mainly to this first-mover advantage and the resulting network effect. Litecoin is inherently better than Bitcoin, as it has a faster block time and a more ASIC-resistant mining algorithm, but nobody cares due to no network effect.

This isn't a 1 or 0 thing. ETH can still be appraised as a store of value, just as silver can still be valued in the face of gold. Furthermore, there are other properties to value ETH on besides store of value, such as DeFi collateral and medium of exchange.\n\nI think your comment is putting the cart before the horse. It's actually quite rare for a marketable instrument's value to be mostly derived from technical merits.

Ethereum accomplishes this through client diversity instead.\n\n> actual decentralisation\n\nTo me, \"decentralization\" really means \"network security\".

PoS has many practical advantages; PoW has fewer advantages and they are only theoretical. Theoretically anyone can mine, but staking requires purchasing an \"in\" from an existing holder.
