It would be like me saying \"The US produces $1 billion worth of fresh water every day. So, for $3 billion, I can buy all the water for the next 3 days and perform a dehydration ransom attack!\"\n\nIn the real world, it wouldn't work. Obviously I would start bidding up the price of water more and more, and then when people caught on to what I was doing, they would act in concert to stop me, because it's in their best interest not to die of dehydration. They would stop selling me water, protest me, ask the government to stop me, etc.\n\nThe same thing applies to a POW network. Sure, it \"only\" costs $20 billion on paper to attack Bitcoin. As soon as I start buying rigs and power in large amounts, the price starts going up. And, *everyone* in the Bitcoin ecosystem is incentivized to stop me. Now that includes the US government itself, since they have a Bitcoin reserve!!!
