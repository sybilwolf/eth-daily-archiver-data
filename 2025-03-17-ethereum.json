Hoodi will replace the Holesky testnet as the primary testing ground for validators on a large network.\n\nThe Hoodi testnet is being spun up by the EF's DevOps team - EthPandaOps. They will run most of the validators at launch themselves and hand over control to different client teams over the coming days. This network is being spun up so quickly that most clients don't even support it yet as a \"named network\" (e.g. `--network hoodi`) and a custom network config file needs to be passed to them. Hoodi will go through the Pectra network upgrade next week at epoch 2,048 (Wed Mar 26 2025 14:37:12 UTC). If that all goes successfully we should hopefully get a tentative mainnet date for the Pectra upgrade at the following all core devs call!\n\n> What about Holesky's future?\n\nHolesky's future is unclear for now. The network is finalizing but there is a huge exit queue so some things simply cannot be tested on the Holesky testnet anymore. The network will probably keep going for at least another month, until mainnet goes through Pectra. Afterwards I expect the Holesky to wind down.\n\nEdit: for Holesky node operators, from nixo:\n\n> Plan from the R&D testing call: ethpandaops would like to keep Holesky running for a few months to run some core dev tests on it before deprecation since it represents a unique situation, testing things like large gas limit increases.

There still are quite a bit of hurdles to overcome until they are better than current rollups.\n\nYour question regarding income from sequencing is only half valid. Sequencing fees can be split into base fee and priority fee as most rollups use EIP-1559. Even when they upgrade to based the rollup creator should be able to decide what happens with the base fee. They are only giving the control away over the priority fee part. If we look at the ratio on Ethereum mainnet it was around 80-90% base fee and 10-20% priority fee for a very long time. I am not convinced that this exact ratio would hold on a rollup as well, but at least it gives an indication that the rollup creator might be able to keep a substantial part of the income. \n\nAn additional advantage for the rollup creator is that they are able hand over part of their job to other actors, which lowers their operation cost and reduces their liabilities from a regulatory standpoint.\n\nThe disadvantage for the user at the moment is that based rollups have to keep the 12 second slot time of Ethereum which results in a worse UX compared to other rollups. At the moment normal rollups do not extract MEV directly and do not allow sandwiching. In based rollups toxic MEV is an issue again. Preconfirmations and MEV protection might solve most of the issues here. \n\nWhat based rollups can give the user in the future is seamless interoperability between different based rollups. This will allow more efficient trade exection and bring the different rollups closer together. Permissionless sequencing, which in my understanding comes with based rollups, will also give us pretty much real time censorship resistance.\n\nThere are reasons to think that based rollup might become a superior way of running rollups, we are just not there yet. At the moment there are pretty much no reasons for a rollup to become based though. I can see a future where 'normal' rollups will have to chose if they want to become based (or even native-based) for the better security guarantees and native interoperability it brings or if they turn into L2s with altDA for the cheaper execution prices and scalability they can get there. There might be no middle ground anymore.\n\nSpecific for the case of Base I have not seen yet any indication of them doing anything malicious or trying to defect from their goal of being a rollup. They are part of a publicly traded company and for sure do not do things out of the goodness of their heart. At the moment their goals still align very much with Ethereums goals, even though they are slower than competitors in making next steps regarding security. If they want to become a credibly neutral layer for other institutions to build on Base then I do not see another way than for them to become a based or even native-based rollup. If their goal is to 'just' bring defi to coinbase users, then their setup is good enough and there might be no reason to turn into a based rollup. We will see which niche they will try to occupy in the future.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In my view there is no reason for anyone to upgrade to based rollups, at least at the moment.

Sequencing fees can be split into base fee and priority fee as most rollups use EIP-1559. Even when they upgrade to based the rollup creator should be able to decide what happens with the base fee. They are only giving the control away over the priority fee part. If we look at the ratio on Ethereum mainnet it was around 80-90% base fee and 10-20% priority fee for a very long time. I am not convinced that this exact ratio would hold on a rollup as well, but at least it gives an indication that the rollup creator might be able to keep a substantial part of the income. </p>\n\n<p>An additional advantage for the rollup creator is that they are able hand over part of their job to other actors, which lowers their operation cost and reduces their liabilities from a regulatory standpoint.</p>\n\n<p>The disadvantage for the user at the moment is that based rollups have to keep the 12 second slot time of Ethereum which results in a worse UX compared to other rollups. At the moment normal rollups do not extract MEV directly and do not allow sandwiching. In based rollups toxic MEV is an issue again. Preconfirmations and MEV protection might solve most of the issues here. </p>\n\n<p>What based rollups can give the user in the future is seamless interoperability between different based rollups. This will allow more efficient trade exection and bring the different rollups closer together. Permissionless sequencing, which in my understanding comes with based rollups, will also give us pretty much real time censorship resistance.</p>\n\n<p>There are reasons to think that based rollup might become a superior way of running rollups, we are just not there yet. At the moment there are pretty much no reasons for a rollup to become based though. I can see a future where &#39;normal&#39; rollups will have to chose if they want to become based (or even native-based) for the better security guarantees and native interoperability it brings or if they turn into L2s with altDA for the cheaper execution prices and scalability they can get there. There might be no middle ground anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Specific for the case of Base I have not seen yet any indication of them doing anything malicious or trying to defect from their goal of being a rollup. They are part of a publicly traded company and for sure do not do things out of the goodness of their heart. At the moment their goals still align very much with Ethereums goals, even though they are slower than competitors in making next steps regarding security. If they want to become a credibly neutral layer for other institutions to build on Base then I do not see another way than for them to become a based or even native-based rollup. If their goal is to &#39;just&#39; bring defi to coinbase users, then their setup is good enough and there might be no reason to turn into a based rollup. We will see which niche they will try to occupy in the future.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-17 11:47:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"miazyfj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jd5yhz","parent_id":"t1_mi93709","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/timwithnotoolbelt","body":"Theres three reasons people use base currently imo.

The speakers, Harry CE and Max Senor, cover topics such as the history of Cypher Punk, the importance of cryptography, technological advances like public key cryptography and anonymous communication, and movements like Wikileaks and Anonymous. They emphasize the need for privacy, freedom, and empowerment of individuals through cryptography. They also touch on the intersection of Cypher Punk philosophy with anarchism and the ethical and moral aspects of the movement, distancing it from religious fervor and highlighting the importance of decentralization. Towards the end, they address funding challenges for Cypher Punk technologies and stress the need for support and contributions to advance the movement.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How has the Cypher Punk movement influenced the development and ethos of blockchain technology, particularly in terms of privacy, decentralization, and empowerment of individuals?\n\n- In what ways can the lessons learned from movements like Wikileaks and Anonymous inform the future direction and evolution of Cypher Punk technologies within the blockchain space?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
