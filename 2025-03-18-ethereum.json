And the second is $500 prize pool for the inaugural tournament for college basketball, you can access at <a href=\"https://frontofficefantasy.xyz\">https://frontofficefantasy.xyz</a> </p>\n\n<p>So far there has only been 1 RT in the contest which puts your expected value at $250 for doing it. The college basketball bracket only has a handful of people so your odds are pretty good there too. I recommend using desktop for now and if you sign up with Privy, you don&#39;t need gas to enter.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-18 10:16:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"migvr8c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jdyd7c","parent_id":"t3_1jdyd7c","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"I have no reach but I'm always happy to help a fellow EVM.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have no reach but I&#39;m always happy to help a fellow EVM.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-03-18 10:48:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mih2i41","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jdyd7c","parent_id":"t1_migvr8c","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/HarryZKE","body":"you've reached my heart sir, thank you\n\nalso worth mentioning im planning on giving 2% of the supply of tokens to EVMs, so with 1b planned supply, that's 15000 tokens for each EVM.

The talk outlined the concept of effective balance, its impact on validator activation, rewards, penalties, and voting weight. The introduction of a \"compounding validator\" with a maximum effective balance of 248 ETH was highlighted, along with features such as partial withdrawals and consolidation. Changes were also mentioned regarding slashing penalties to promote adoption and improve the overall efficiency of validators. Potential implications on validator count, infrastructure costs, and network security were discussed, emphasizing the need for key security and risk assessment.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nHow do you think the proposed changes to increase the maximum effective balance for validators will impact the overall stability and security of the Ethereum network?\n\n\n\nIn what ways could the adjustments to slashing penalties and rewards influence the behavior of validators and contribute to the decentralization of the network?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
