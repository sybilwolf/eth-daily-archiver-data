Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at Blackrock: Take ETHA, for example, iShares Ethereum Trust. It had $4 billion in inflow in its first 6 months. The number of ETFs historically who have had more than that is a very short list. But when you compare it to IBIT and the Bitcoin ETF complex generally, it doesn\u2019t look that amazing. When you compare it to the actual ETF universe, it\u2019s actually been incredibly successful. So I know that some people have that [negative] perception out there, but I can say that, **from Blackrock's perspective, we think it\u2019s been tremendously successful**, both commercially and the way that these products have functioned, the market quality, liquidity, etc.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a next phase in the potential evolution of this, because the ETF has turned out to be a really really compelling vehicle through which to hold Bitcoin for lots of different investor types. There\u2019s no question it\u2019s less perfect for ETH today - without staking. Because staking yield is a meaningful part of how you can generate investor return in this space. And all the ETFs, of course, at launch did not have staking. So, if that is able to get resolved - it\u2019s not a particularly easy problem, it\u2019s not as simple as, you know, a new administration just green-lighting something and then boom we\u2019re all good, off to the races. There\u2019s a lot of fairly complex challenges that have to be figured out, but if that can get figured out, then I think it\u2019s gonna be a step change upward in terms of what we see the activity around those products is.\n\n[Lubin talks about the tech]\n\n2:02:53 - Vivek Raman, Founder of Etherealize: Last question, and, zooming out, we are in a new paradigm of blockchain adoption. There\u2019s a lot of different players out there, there\u2019s a lot of competition out there. Ethereum was founded on the basis of decentralization and being a resilient network. I\u2019ll zoom out and ask as the final question: Does decentralization matter anymore, from an institutional standpoint, and what value do they put on a decentralized network? I\u2019ll start with Robbie.\n\n2:03:20 - Robert: Well, I think it does matter, I think some of the negativity around Ethereum and the narrative lately is very overdone. There is a lot to be optimistic about. Joe\u2019s obviously characterized that very eloquently. When you look at our experience, take BUIDL for example, there was no question that the blockchain that we would start our tokenization on would be Ethereum. And that\u2019s not just a Blackrock thing, that\u2019s really anybody who would enter this space. That\u2019s the natural default answer. That\u2019s really important.\n\nAnd you see even today, we\u2019re excited about having this be a multi-chain product now, we\u2019re seeing assets across all of them, but Ethereum has a significant majority of the assets still, and so clients clearly are making choices. They do value the decentralization, they do value the credibility and the security. And that\u2019s a great advantage that Ethereum continues to have.\n\nPersonal thoughts: Yes it's great to finally hear Blackrock say ETHEREUM instead of \"blockchain\".

She emphasizes the importance of understanding the majority users' needs and values in contrast to early adopters, suggesting methods like identifying online \"watering holes\" and testing value propositions with real users. Georgia also highlights the significance of testing key user acquisition and retention moments to gauge the product's appeal and value proposition. She advocates for utilizing innovative approaches and seeking collaboration at the adoption Hub for further insights and strategies. Additionally, when questioned about user recruitment for testing, she suggests engaging at the adoption Hub and focusing on user research rather than sales pitches.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can understanding the needs and values of majority users versus early adopters impact the success of a web three product like a DeFi protocol in terms of adoption and user engagement?\n\n- In what ways can identifying and testing key user acquisition and retention moments help in refining the value proposition of a web three product, such as a DeFi protocol, for wider adoption?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
