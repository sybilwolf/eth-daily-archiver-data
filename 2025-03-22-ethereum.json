Let's talk some macroecon storms.\n\nAt this moment I am much more concerned about a *deflationary spike* than I am about tariffs. The market has already crashed about tariffs; that's baked in, now. A deflationary spike, though, will straight up blindside most of the market.\n\nFor starters, take a good look at [this chart from the St. Louis Fed.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)\n\nThe Fed printed about $5 Trillion in COVID quantitative easing policy between 2020 and 2022, and this produced an inflationary pulse in 2022. Then the Fed abruptly reversed policy and started quantitative tightening to stop inflation. They actually shrank M2 by about $1 Trillion, or 5% of the total M2.\n\nNow, I think that the best way to visualize monetary policy is with waves in a pool. Note that this is not how most people visualize QE/ QT policy. I think this way because money moves from one bank account to another much like waves push water around.\n\nAnd the thing with dealing with waves is that timing your move is actually more important than making a huge wave. \n\nNow, note the period of times between things. The Fed started their COVID policy in March 2020 and inflation officially peaked in June 2022. From this, I am making two educated guesses:\n\n* It actually takes a really long time for money to work it's way all the way through the economy. The time from stimulus to peak inflation is actually only a quarter wavelength, so a full inflationary/ deflationary pulse wavelength through the global economy is about 11 years long. That's *shockingly* slow (I am surprised I'm surprised, though; the US has infamously bad wealth inequality.)\n\n* Because that wave is so slow, the Fed actually missed the correct timing window. If you wanted to stop the inflation in 2022, the correct time to pivot would have been in summer 2021. Instead, they started in June 2022, which by my best guess, appears to be when inflation was naturally cresting, anyways.\n\nNormally inflationary pressures are much stronger than deflationary ones and inflationary pressure cancels out deflationary pressure. Not right now. When the Fed missed their timing window to start QT, they created a black swan scenario where an inflationary QE pulse followed by a deflationary QT pressure formed *constructive wave interference.* \n\nWe are currently on the deflationary leg, and the deflationary leg is due to hit it's peak effect in...Q2 to Q3 2025.\n\nFrom that point on, I'm sure you can guess how the Fed will respond. They'll lock the money printer open again and asset prices will soar. I think it's probably safer to think we'll see crypto flying high in Q1 or Q2 2026, but yeah, ATH this year is doesn't strike me as too implausible.

The talk, titled \"Layer Zero: Reimagining Ancient Philosophies to Build New Worlds,\" explored the concept of layer zero in the context of web3 and crypto space values. The speaker discussed the importance of reconnecting to human values and underlying philosophies to address systemic issues in technology, advocating for a deeper integration of spirituality and technology. They touched upon topics such as community currencies, the concept of Da and Chi, and the need for decentralized systems that align with nature and human values. Projects like Pagoda and Light Forest were highlighted as examples of initiatives bridging Asian philosophies with technology. The speaker emphasized the need for individuals to do inner work and reconnect with the web of life to create a more connected and mindful world. Questions from the audience revolved around recommendations for further reading on the topic and ideas for reimagining concepts of money in the cryptocurrency space. The discussion also touched upon the DigicNX project, aiming to connect digital nomads with local communities in Shanghai, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building deeper connections between different worlds.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nWhat role do you think ancient philosophies and spirituality can play in shaping the future of technology, particularly in the crypto space and decentralized systems?\n\n\n\nHow can initiatives like Pagoda and Light Forest serve as models for integrating Asian philosophies into technological projects, and what lessons can be drawn from these examples for creating more holistic and value-aligned systems in the crypto space?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
