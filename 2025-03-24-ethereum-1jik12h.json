I don't even know whether to call them mistakes, but they're definitely decisions that have led to lower mind and market share than would've otherwise been possible. I will call them mistakes here because of their consequences, not necessarily because I believe the decisions should have gone the other way.\n\nThe common long term theme is a lack of marketing and build-it-and-they-will-come attitude. As has been discussed extensively, alt L1s use their huge amounts of VC money to lobby and bribe people into adoption. Ethereum doesn't do this, people either decide do use it on its own merits or they don't. Rocket Pool is quite similar. Most other staking protocols pay large incentives to DAOs, CEXes and dapps to hold or integrate their LST. Rocket Pool has always just relied on people choosing to stake with it because of its decentralization ethos. No Ledger Live integration, no short-term looping incentives etc. In the early days, the DAO was even against incentivizing liquidity, although that one turned out to be unavoidable. A recent example is Arbitrum choosing to stake with Lido because of a huge commission rebate that means Lido doesn't even really make any money from the deal. In the aftermath of the Bybit hack, it was also apparent that a lot of their ETH was held in stETH and even Mantle's staking token. Mantle then rugged the hackers when trying to unstake, which was somehow perceived as a good thing from the few reactions I have seen when that ability shouldn't even exist imo. I can't really blame people for taking the money when they have a choice of which LSTs to integrate or get a good offer for an exclusive deal, but it is still disappointing that the only way to get ahead seems to be spending huge amounts of money unsustainably.\n\nAnother major mistake seems to have been combining the lack of marketing with a priority to do things \"right\" over UX. For Ethereum, this is chain fragmentation and lack of L1 scaling in favor of sustainable long-term scaling. For Rocket Pool, it's a lack of rETH withdrawal requests before Pectra among other things. The reason is the same: not wanting to centralize the protocol even temporarily to make things easier, but the lesson seems to be that users don't care. UX is king and decentralization is a secondary consideration, which is also a major reason crypto as a whole can't compete with web2 yet.\n\nHaving said all of this, there is one significant difference. Ethereum has enjoyed a first mover advantage. So while it's losing dominance against other chains like Solana, it will likely still be in a good enough position when UX catches up to regain dominance and \"win\". I am not so optimistic about Rocket Pool. If a year from now rETH has trustless withdrawal requests, does it even matter if the DAO doesn't have any money to pay for liquidity anymore and the protocol sits at 1% staking market share? And while they both aim to be permissionless base layers for others to build on top of, Rocket Pool has never achieved the amount of traction necessary for that to materialize significantly.

The implementation of access lists could lead to significant scaling improvements, security enhancements, and better indexing in the Ethereum ecosystem. The speaker highlighted the importance of knowing state access ahead of time to enable concurrent execution and prevent conflicts, emphasizing the benefits of an account-centric model for scalability and security. There was also a discussion on the challenges and potential solutions related to correctly implementing access lists to enhance consensus rules and improve transaction predictability.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How might the introduction of deterministic state addresses and access lists impact the overall scalability and security of Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions, and what are the key considerations in implementing this new account model?\n\n\n\n- In what ways can the usage of access lists improve transaction predictability and consensus rules in the Ethereum ecosystem, and what challenges need to be addressed for successful implementation?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

The Governor will detail the Cowboy State\u2019s eight-year history of passing forward-thinking legislation around digital assets, and the benefits of the Wyoming Stable Token for consumers, his state, and the nation.   Governor Gordon and Director Apollo will also be available to meet with members of the news media immediately following the main stage discussion. Members of the media and general public who are unable to attend the Summit may livestream it on Rumble or here.   \u201cWyoming has set the gold standard for digital asset innovation, leading the way with legislation and regulatory clarity that other states\u2014as well as the federal government\u2014are working to emulate. Governor Gordon\u2019s leadership, particularly in pioneering the Wyoming Stable Token Commission, is a shining example of how government can embrace digital assets while ensuring consumer protections and financial stability,\u201d said Cody Carbone, President of The Digital Chamber.
