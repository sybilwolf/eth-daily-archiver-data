He explained the importance of oracles in bringing off-chain information onto the blockchain, using examples like price oracles for DeFi contracts. He highlighted the need for specialized oracles in dispute resolution scenarios, emphasizing the challenges of designing an oracle system, including participant selection, information format, aggregation methods, and incentive structures. George compared delegated and crowd models for oracles and discussed different projects like Chainlink, giving insights on aggregation mechanisms and CIL resistance. He also delved into the concept of \"microcheating,\" attack vulnerabilities, and various incentive functions used by oracle projects. George presented research on voting mechanisms for dispute resolution and the comparison between data aggregation techniques like taking medians and voting by intervals. He also addressed concerns about oracle reliability, potential free riding in voting systems, and the balance between centralized, algorithmic, and decentralized oracle models in the crypto space.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can the crypto community work towards addressing the challenges of designing a reliable oracle system, considering factors such as participant selection, information format, and incentive structures?\n\n- In what ways can different oracle models, including delegated, crowd, centralized, algorithmic, and decentralized, contribute to improving the reliability and efficiency of bringing off-chain information onto the blockchain?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

You deposit 100 USD, mint 100 USDC, sell the USDC for 101 USD, and you've made a $1 profit. Loop that enough, you eat through the order book and USDC is at $1.00 again.\n\nSay USDC price is $0.99. You deposit 100 USD, buy ~101 USDC, redeem them for 101 USD, and you've made a $1 profit. Loop that enough and USDC is at $1.00 again.\n\nWith USDC, any old person with a Coinbase account can mint and redeem them. With USDT, only specified institutions can, but it works all the same as long as there is at least one institution performing this profitable process (USDT can in theory perform it themselves, even).\n\nThe peg for a fiat-backed stablecoin is strictly enforced by arbitrage, and it can only break if that arb cycle isn't functional. For example, if there is a bunch of sudden redemption pressure due to insolvency risk, but on a weekend so nobody can actually transfer USD into their accounts to perform the arbitrage loop needed to meet that redemption pressure (since USD doesn't settle on weekends).\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/11/stablecoin-usdc-breaks-dollar-peg-after-firm-reveals-it-has-3point3-billion-in-svb-exposure.html\n\nSo the chain itself doesn't matter in terms of keeping a stablecoin's peg. The only thing that matters is the mint/redeem arbitrage loop. The peg breaks if and only if the redemption loop breaks.\n\nBank stocks are a bit different, since they aren't a directly redeemable claim on an asset. Like, you can't just walk into a bank as a stockholder and demand a part of the assets on their balance sheet, or conversely give them assets and demand shares of stock. A more fitting example is perhaps shares of ETFs, since they can be directly redeemed for their underlying stocks by authorized market makers at any time. Thus, ETFs generally track the prices of their underlying stocks extremely accurately - no matter whether the ETF itself is a popular low-cost index fund or a scarcely held high-fee scam.\n\nEdit: And as /u/Bob-Rossi mentioned, market cap is where to look to get an idea of which stablecoin deployment is more popular, which may be a proxy for what people believe about its security.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Yet, why do stable coins on all networks maintain pegs as if the network makes no difference?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a great question, and I have what&#39;s hopefully a great answer.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s because they are constantly arbitraged back to the price of one dollar, because they are actually redeemable for real dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Say USDC price is $1.01.
