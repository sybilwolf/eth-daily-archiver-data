The talk covered hashing, encryption, and signatures as first-generation cryptographic primitives, and introduced programmable cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party computation, and fully homomorphic encryption. Examples, applications, and resources for diving deeper into cryptography were shared, emphasizing the blend of art and science in creating secure systems. The speakers also provided a brief overview of Diffie-Hellman key exchange and its role in establishing secure connections like HTTPS.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How can programmable cryptography, such as zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation, enhance the security and privacy of decentralized applications built on the Ethereum platform?\n\n\n\n2. In what ways can developers successfully balance the art and science of cryptography to ensure the creation of robust and secure systems in the context of Ethereum development?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
