Seems like now is a good time to bring it all together. The first version of the post had issues being approved. I had to move the links to a separate post. \n\nFirst of all, EOF is not one single improvement, there are 12 EIPs bundled together. They all are around how the Ethereum Virtual Machine works. The most prominent one is the introduction of the Ethereum Object Format (EOF v1) which gave the bundle of EIPs their name. All these changes are on a very low level, deep down the Ethereum stack, so most people will never directly touch it, but these changes have an influenced on the layers above it. Only very few people understand that layer of the EVM stack and I am definitely not one of them, so I will try to rehash the discussion from other people. I try to do it as well as possible, but be warned this is just how I understand it.\n\nAfter the recent blog post by one of the a geth core dev (light client) and more application side community members (Ramana and Moody) there has been quite some discussion again. Their conclusion was that EOF is vastly too complex to achieve what they want to achieve and there are a few easier shortcuts one can take through the compilers without having to change the EVM itself. This would mean less risk.\n\nThe nethermind core dev Ben Adams had a longer discussion on the daily gwei discord about the above blog post rehashing what the object Format means and why it is necessary and also what the shortcuts would mean. The discussion is spread out over several days and channels. Search for EOF to find them all.\n\nFirst about the object format itself: This format defines how compiled solidity code is stored and organized. The current format used is a format that has been used in computer science until the 70ies. Mostly an unstructured mess of executable code and storage. One can jump from any part of the code to any other one and it is pretty impossible to judge from the compiled code what it actually does, because it is all intermingled and executable code could become storage or vice versa. This makes it pretty much impossible to analyze compiled code for its security. For more than 50 years we use more structured formats to store binary code. This makes programs more secure and easier to reason about. So, EOF is a way to bring the lower level of the EVM to the modern era. He says that even the opponents of EOF agree that if the EVM would be designed today they would change the EOF to a modern format as proposed by the EOF EIPs. \n\nNow to the specific points brought up in the above mentioned blog post. For Ben Adams the proposed solutions are just additional hacks which make the EVM more complex, add technical debt and do not solve any of the things EOF was set out to solve. These hacks also bring risks in itself, so they will have to write more code and more test to make sure these are safe to use. He assumes these would take another year to ship. This would collide with other suggested EL improvements on the roadmap (ePBS and Focil), so these suggested EOF changes would probably never ship.\n\nHe also argues that the gains from canceling EOF would be minimal as the code has been written and the test have been implemented as well. He argues there has hardly been any EL change tested so thoroughly. All the time has already been spent to make sure EOF is as safe as possible, any change to it would just cost more time.\n\nHe agrees that changing is a risk and it is a big change, but compared to all the codebase changes in Nethermind since the last upgrade (dencun) EOF is only a small fraction of all changes, but he agrees they are in a critical part of the code. \n\nThere is also a recent blog post by the Besu team about their stance on EOF.\n\nIn short they say nothing in the above mentioned blog post changed their view on EOF and Fusaka should include it. They say an additional PAY opcode should be added to mitigate a smaller issue with EOF.\n\nThe solidity lang group also published a blog post 2 days ago making the case for EOF. This one is very detailed. If you are on the technical side have a look at it. They also are all for EOF as it improves tooling, formal verification possibilities, transpilation of code into different VMs and overall code verification. This has a lot of benefits for devs, L2s and also for client teams. They also say that it is too early to ossify the execution layer side of things just yet.\n\n\nMy overall feel from these posts and the ACD calls is that only a small subset of core devs and community members are against it. Currently it only seems to come from lightclient, a geth core dev and the former strong opponent Marius van der Wijden, another geth core dev, is now indifferent. Every other core dev seems to be at least indifferent or very pro to include EOF in Fusaka. They see the risk, but are confident that the risks have been tackled properly. The discussions I have heard in the ACD calls where mostly about smaller tweaks to EOF. When I look at his I do not see a compelling reason to be against EOF itself. There might still be good reasons to tweak small things here and there, but the overall package seems to have broad support.\n\nTLDR: EOF is good. It has complexity which has been tackled by improving the testing. There are opponents, but they are very far and few in between and most people in the know seem to support it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Funny, I wanted to write something about EOF for a few days now.

Let me break it down:\n\n1. **Security Budget & Block Reward:**\n\nThe concern about the block reward decreasing over time is valid but requires some context. Yes, the block reward will decrease gradually as the block subsidy halves approximately every four years. But it\u2019s essential to understand that Bitcoin\u2019s security model is not solely reliant on block rewards \u2014 it\u2019s a combination of incentives.\n\n2. **Transaction Fees:**\n\nThe key part of Bitcoin\u2019s long-term security model is the transition from block rewards (currently 6.25 BTC per block) to transaction fees as the primary incentive for miners. While the block reward will decrease, transaction fees are expected to grow in importance. As Bitcoin adoption increases, more transactions will be processed, and thus, transaction fees will naturally rise. This increase in fees will help maintain miner incentives.\n\n3. **Mining Economics:**\n\nBitcoin mining is indeed energy-intensive, but miners are incentivized by the potential rewards \u2014 not just the block subsidy, but also transaction fees. As the network matures, mining efficiency improves, and transaction fees are expected to offset the declining block reward. This is a gradual process, and many well-informed analysts believe that it will create a more sustainable network in the long run.\n\n4. **Indestructibility & Long-Term Security:**\n\nThe statement about Bitcoin becoming \u201cindestructible\u201d is rooted in the idea that Bitcoin\u2019s security doesn\u2019t rely purely on block rewards. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, the difficulty adjustment algorithm, and the fact that miners can adapt to a lower block reward by finding more efficient ways to mine or adjusting to changing market conditions all contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s long-term resilience. There are already numerous proposals and technologies, like the Lightning Network, that are optimizing Bitcoin\u2019s scalability and usability, indirectly increasing miner incentives.\n\n5. **The Future of Bitcoin:**\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy and block reward schedule are deterministic and transparent. Unlike traditional systems, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t rely on a central authority to adjust its policy \u2014 it follows the code. That said, if in the future the block reward proves to be insufficient, it\u2019s always possible to make network upgrades via soft forks, which have been implemented in the past to ensure the protocol continues to function optimally.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nWhile the block reward decreasing over time is a concern, Bitcoin\u2019s security model is robust, and transaction fees will gradually take over as the primary miner incentive. The protocol is designed to evolve in response to changing economic conditions, and Bitcoin\u2019s long-term security is backed by the incentives of a decentralized, competitive network of miners.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has always been designed to be resilient, and it\u2019s not about a \u201ckindhearted\u201d group of miners \u2014 it\u2019s about a robust, economically driven network that adapts to ensure security and sustainability.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>first of all fool is yourself. second of all. nowadays eveyone can look up any answer through AI. let me do it for u...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to address a few misconceptions in the comment you\u2019ve mentioned.
