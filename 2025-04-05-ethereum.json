Also, can I come up with a better name for it? The name came from: I\u2019m one of those people who always reads the Daily the next day, so I knew I wouldn\u2019t be breaking any news in these posts, and I didn\u2019t want people to have the expectation of more than a summary of what\u2019s happened.\n\n**What I learned from doing it:**\n\nI was spending a lot of time following Ethereum anyway, so I thought I might as well write it up for other people that don\u2019t have the time to follow Ethereum closely. It couldn\u2019t take much longer than what I was already doing, right? I said I\u2019d try it for a month, anyway, to see how it worked. It takes longer than expected, however, and then I started to spend more time reading about Ethereum, as I felt I\u2019d better be more knowledgeable if I was going to explain things to other people.\n\nIt was also harder than expected because Reddit shadow-bans some posts because of banned links. Some of my posts didn\u2019t go up till long after I'd first tried to publish them, as I figured out what was wrong (thanks to u/Tricky_Troll for help with that).\n\nI think I\u2019ve learned how to minimize time wasted on banned links now, however. First, test post things in a sub where you\u2019re a moderator. Just create your own sub if you don\u2019t have one (they\u2019re free). That way you can immediately see if a post was removed by Reddit. I also check posts from an alternate account. Then do A/B testing until you find the problem link. You can probably find a different link to replace it with, e.g. from X, which doesn't seem to have a ban problem.\n\nSuggestions from my learning about banned links:\n\nAs a sub, we should collect a list of banned links and disseminate it. DAO forums are one category, as well as other major Ethereum sites like eips dot ethereum dot org and ens dot domains.\n\nAs Reddit users, we ought to try to get Reddit to change their bad policies: massive over-banning of links, no transparency on what links are banned, and shadow-bans so you don\u2019t know there\u2019s a problem with your content. Does someone here want to start a sub and a movement to pressure Reddit to reform this?\n\n**My objectives in starting Yesterday in Ethereum**\n\nYesterday in Ethereum is what I wish existed, but doesn\u2019t: a way to follow Ethereum pretty closely (not just news but also useful information) without spending much time on it.\n\nI wanted it to be a tl;dr (I almost always summarize the things I link to); promote the Daily (as most Reddit users will only see the top level of r/Ethereum, never go into the Daily); evangelize Ethereum (I\u2019m a true believe, and I find it easy to write positive things about it); and educate people about Ethereum. The last point overlaps a lot with evangelization. Many of you have a better technical understanding of Ethereum than me, but I think I\u2019m pretty good at ELI 15-ing it: making it easy for people to understand the value of the technology.\n\n**Do you think I can get monetize this?**\n\nI\u2019d like to keep on doing this, and preferably improve it (e.g. with an email newsletter). I enjoy doing it, but it takes a lot of time so I\u2019d probably have to monetize it to justify continuing to spend the time on it. Do you think it\u2019s practical to monetize it? Do you have any suggestions on how to do it? I remember that u/EvanVanNess had a grant from the Ethereum Foundation for the Week in Ethereum News (though he lost it)\u2026 or I could ask if a major crypto publication wants me to do it for them (though I prefer independence).\n\nYesterday in Ethereum may go on hiatus for a while, or stop (maybe I\u2019ll do one more this weekend, if I have time), as I think about whether I can continue it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For those of you that don\u2019t get out of the Daily: I started doing posts at the top level of <a href=\"/r/Ethereum\">r/Ethereum</a> summarizing Ethereum news.

The key metrics to look at here are the cost of attacking the blockchain, the number of entities who need to collude to attack the blockchain and how well the blockchain can handle and recover from an attack. A successful attack on the Bitcoin network would be cheaper to perform and much more difficult to recover from.\n\nFor Bitcoin there are a few ways to look at the cost and difficulty of attacking the network. One can calculate the cost to acquire the amount of PoW ASIC mining rigs needed to gain the majority hash rate and 51% attack the network, which often is estimated to be around $10-20 billion if you simply could go out and buy all the equipment on the market. Then there's the cost to pay for electricity to operate the mining equipment. This cost is closely related to the block reward, which at the time of speaking is roughly $1.5 million per hour. This actually means that the lowest cost to attack the Bitcoin network, if you someone has access to the mining equipment already, is only $1,500,000 per hour. So an attacker doesn't actually need a budget for $10-20 billion, for someone with the opportunity the network can be attacked with essentially no penalty. Another angle would be to rent the hash power by setting up a pool offering 20% higher mining rewards than competitors to attract miners and allow outdated mining equipment that couldn't otherwise mine profitably to come back online. This way an attacker with a budget of say $2 billion would have almost a year to gain majority hashpower and launch an attack, without needing to purchase any mining equipment.\n\nObtaining 51% of the hashpower on the Bitcoin network gives an attacker complete control of the network. The attacker with 51% of the hashpower can censor transactions, perform reorgs that rewrite history and double spend. The concept of finality is only theoretical in Bitcoin, meaning there's no real protection against reorgs and the way to ensure that a block remains valid as part of the canonical chain, is to wait for *some* period of time until enough subsequent blocks have been added to the chain and it is deemed safe to assume the chain is valid. This is why when you deposit BTC to an exchange, you have to wait for some amount of confirmations before the amount is credited. Furthermore, in a 51% attack, blocks can be reorganised at no cost to the attacker as Bitcoin doesn't have the concept of slashing. The only way to actively stop an attack on Bitcoin, would be to accrue more honest hash power, or introduce a fork that replaces the hashing algorithm, effectively removing Bitcoin's security by rendering all ASIC miners useless.\n\nBecause Ethereum has both slashing and achieves economic finality, it offers much higher security guarantees and make it easy to remove a malicious actor from the network. Any kind of attack on the network will result in great financial loss to the attacker. Because it requires 2/3 of active validators to come to consensus and reach finality, an attacker with 33-50% of the total stake will be able to prevent the network from finalizing by not attesting to blocks. This does not halt the network, but means economic security isn't reached. However, in such an event the attacker will be penalized by the inactivity leak, and their stake will erode until it represents less than 1/3 and network again finalizes.\n\nA \"51% attack\" that takes complete control of Ethereum actually requires 66.7% of the total stake which comes out to about 22 million ETH worth roughly $40 billion at the moment - if they were able to gain control of ETH already staked. If they were to buy all that ETH on the market to set up their own validators, that price would be $80 billion, assuming they could buy 40 million ETH on the market without casusing the price to increase. Should an attack occur, the community would orchestrate a soft fork and the attacker would lose their stake, meaning a malicious actor only can perform one attack at a cost of $40-80 billion. This would also cause ETH to instantly become more scarce, making a similar attack in the future much more expensive and less likely to repeat.\n\nAnother way to determine the level of security, is to look at how many mining pool or staking pool operators would need to collude to attack the networks, whether that is from hacking, bribery or coercion. In Bitcoin the largest 2 mining pools, Foundry and Antpool, currently control over 51% of the hashpower. This means only 2 entities must collude, be ceased or become compromised in order to 51% attack the network. In Ethereum it would require the largest 3 staking pools, Lido, Coinbase, and Binance to reach 67% of the total stake. One can argue that isn't a big difference, but since an attack on Ethereum from these 3 actors would result in them getting slashed, they would be permantly removed from the equation. In the case of Bitcoin, there'd be no effective way of dealing with Antpool and Foundry, you'd have to wait for miners to realize they were lending their hash power to attacking the network and take their miners offline or divert them elsewhere. In such a scenario surely Foundry and Antpool would lose business, but they wouldn't suffer a loss to the tune of tens of billions of dollars and the mining equipment would still remain available on the market and could be used in a similar style of attack in the future.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum&#39;s PoS conensus mechanism is by far more secure and face a much smaller centralization issue than Bitcoin&#39;s PoW mechanism.
