Ethereum was still the only bet.\n\nToday it is 2025 and I am down huge sums of money from the tops. I've still got 85% of my life savings in ETH so this is very scary. But as with last time, when I look around, what do I see? Bitcoin is still a pet rock and closer to a security budget crisis than ever. Solana, loves devious and misleading marketing, isn't all that decentralised and has a questionable scaling plan with little research going on beyond Firedancer, their push to create high throughput validator software. But we have that with Nethermind recently pushing above 1 giga gas in testing and also Reth, a client built in Rust, specifically with performance in mind. But we also have so much more with rollup development, single slot finality (or close to it), statelessness, the beam chain etc etc. The list of things on the roadmap being researched is, for the first time in my 8 years in this space, too long for me to list and remember them all.\n\nI could list off other smart contract platforms, but it's all the same story for most of them. I'm sure that there are some genuine attempts from smaller teams, but how can you compete with the absolute powerhouse which is Ethereum's research? Even if there was an equally innovative competitor, good luck competing with Ethereum's moat. have you seen the non-exhaustive list https://ethereumadoption.com?\n\nSo what's different this time around? I'm not seeing much. Ethereum is still in the lead and the world still needs a permissionless settlement layer (yes, it does. But that's a different discussion for another post).\n\nBut ok, let me play devil's advocate for a moment so you know I'm not just full of hopium, or maybe even copium at these prices. It's been 8 years since our first DApp launched. Where is the killer DApp? A large portion of the public hates anything crypto, and rightly so after the Gensler SEC forced only shitty JPEGs of NFTs to be allowed as digital baseball cards aren't securities but tokenised album royalties are.\n\nI understand the frustration around the lack of meaningful DApps taking off. But what if I told you we've already got our killer DApp and that more are coming now that there is no longer an actively hostile regulatory regime in the USA?\n\nStablecoin volumes are through the roof and Ethereum is dominating. The project I work for is paying a Nigerian Telegram moderator and a Turkish artist to do work for us. They get a few hundred bucks from time to time - employment and currency stability which is hard to come by where they're from. What does it cost us? A fraction of a cent on an L2. An L2 which very soon will be a decentralised and a cross-L2 liquidity sharing based or native rollup. As financially privileged westerners, we may not quite see the significance of this. It is business without borders. To taxes other than income tax, no tariffs. Just me looking for someone to help with someone and the largest possible market of people who could fill that role.\n\nAs for DApps for us privileged westerners, well the US regulatory regime change has seen a boom in experimentation. Companies are finally willing to build the long discussed apps which would've previously landed you a Wells notice from the SEC. I think in 1-2 years time there will be some amazing apps being build which can plug right into the recently developed account abstracted wallets.\n\nWhile the jury is still out on what macro does to ETH price in the short to medium term, my long term investment is actually looking better than it was the last time we saw these levels of capitulation.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>My average buy was $450 when we crashed down to $80 in 2018/19.

It&#39;s not ready because people are emotional and that&#39;s not going to change. Meanwhile, I have not sold anything. But unfortunately there are many, many paper hands and also manipulators that want to see the prices go lower. A whale could easily undercut the market by intentionally selling lower. Let&#39;s say they allocate 1,000-2,000 ETH to be sold at discount. They can start selling lower and lower on purpose. Meanwhile they wait to scoop up more with sidelined cash at a massive discount.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-06 19:46:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mlsxial","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jsnf2h","parent_id":"t1_mls2hp7","score":0,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/edmundedgar","body":"> But shouldn't crypto and ETH be more resilient?

Unconvincing when Ethereum was originally created with a primary goal of moving to PoS. If you didn&#39;t like it, you didn&#39;t like ETH already anyway. It wouldn&#39;t have been ETH without the merge.</p>\n\n<p>In favor of it having a positive effect: People are incentivized to lock up ETH. That should lower supply.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll give you that price performance has been abysmal since the merge, but I don&#39;t think your reasoning is the appropriate explanation. Solana uses staking and has been doing very well for the past few years.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-06 21:44:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mltd3bo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jsnf2h","parent_id":"t1_mltc6ww","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/El_Lechero696969","body":"I know that this is a Eth sub, but BTC maxis think that one of the reasons for Eth downfall is the change from POW to POS.
