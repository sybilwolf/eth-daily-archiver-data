Moving a factory into the US when it still has to get all of its raw materials from other countries at tariff-hiked prices defeats the purpose.\n\n3.

There's a lot of noise out there, and it's easy to get caught up in the doomer narratives. The market's been weird, L2s are confusing to some, and it's easy to get frustrated. But let's take a step back and look at the big picture:\n\nFirst of all, it would be weird to look at something that's literally number 2 behind Bitcoin, and no alt L1 is even close to that, and say it's dead. It's just that there are a lot of people confusing \"\"financial gain for an investor over a given period\"\" and \"\"overall success of the ecosystem\"\".\n\n*   **Ethereum is a System, not a Stock**: It's more than just a token that people trade and a ticker on an exchange. It is designed as this amazing ecosystem of interoperable blockchains. We keep building because that is where it should end up.\n\n*   **L2's and scaling**: It's probably worth remembering what happens next if the scaling works out well for Ethereum. Maybe 99.9% of people never even touch the base chain, because everything good can be done on chain. There is a chance that L2s will be all that's needed and Ethereum can continue printing money! \"\"But it's Timbuk, look at the current transactions\"\". Of course it hasn't gone up yet. It always takes time, just compare a modern car to one from a hundred years ago. Looked ridiculous then, seems like the future now.\n\n* **The core focus continues**: All those institutions which have been investing and using resources, do not need to follow any of the stupid nonsense and do what they must as adults. That involves creating tradable products to make it more easy for them to move.\n\nFinally, at the core of all things is that we should do whatever it takes to maintain a decentralised system. Don't listen to the noise, the only one that does that is the ticker which everyone so feverously check and that makes us blind in the first place.\"\n\n-----------------------\n\nIt needs a bit more dialing in. It's got substance but it's probably trying a bit too hard to have personality and ends up a tad unhinged and nonsensical \u2014 a different AI model might help. This is not the newest Gemini model. Also, I should probably adjust the system instructions to make it more authoritative and less casual.\n\nI've been scraping some more data for it this week but I haven't given that into the model yet. I also think a good validation dataset will go a long way. But I think it will require a bit of manual work for me to sift through some old dailies to identify some really top tier responses in addition to the ongoing responses I've been getting to my training series of questions.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong><em>\ud83e\udd16 EthFinance FUD Buster Alpha Response \ud83e\udd16:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Look, I get it. There&#39;s a lot of noise out there, and it&#39;s easy to get caught up in the doomer narratives. The market&#39;s been weird, L2s are confusing to some, and it&#39;s easy to get frustrated. But let&#39;s take a step back and look at the big picture:</p>\n\n<p>First of all, it would be weird to look at something that&#39;s literally number 2 behind Bitcoin, and no alt L1 is even close to that, and say it&#39;s dead. It&#39;s just that there are a lot of people confusing &quot;&quot;financial gain for an investor over a given period&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;overall success of the ecosystem&quot;&quot;.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Ethereum is a System, not a Stock</strong>: It&#39;s more than just a token that people trade and a ticker on an exchange. It is designed as this amazing ecosystem of interoperable blockchains. We keep building because that is where it should end up.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>L2&#39;s and scaling</strong>: It&#39;s probably worth remembering what happens next if the scaling works out well for Ethereum. Maybe 99.9% of people never even touch the base chain, because everything good can be done on chain. There is a chance that L2s will be all that&#39;s needed and Ethereum can continue printing money! &quot;&quot;But it&#39;s Timbuk, look at the current transactions&quot;&quot;. Of course it hasn&#39;t gone up yet. It always takes time, just compare a modern car to one from a hundred years ago. Looked ridiculous then, seems like the future now.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The core focus continues</strong>: All those institutions which have been investing and using resources, do not need to follow any of the stupid nonsense and do what they must as adults. That involves creating tradable products to make it more easy for them to move.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, at the core of all things is that we should do whatever it takes to maintain a decentralised system. Don&#39;t listen to the noise, the only one that does that is the ticker which everyone so feverously check and that makes us blind in the first place.&quot;</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>It needs a bit more dialing in. It&#39;s got substance but it&#39;s probably trying a bit too hard to have personality and ends up a tad unhinged and nonsensical \u2014 a different AI model might help. This is not the newest Gemini model. Also, I should probably adjust the system instructions to make it more authoritative and less casual.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been scraping some more data for it this week but I haven&#39;t given that into the model yet. I also think a good validation dataset will go a long way. But I think it will require a bit of manual work for me to sift through some old dailies to identify some really top tier responses in addition to the ongoing responses I&#39;ve been getting to my training series of questions.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-08 22:52:58","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-04-08 23:19:48","id":"mm61t90","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ju6nrw","parent_id":"t1_mm5rx67","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Ideally we can enlist more than just you for that.
