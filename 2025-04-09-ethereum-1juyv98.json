Also it's not guaranteed to \"win\" given tech changes so fast.\n\nI'd argue native dapps are most definitely relevant to the blockchain's native token, as they are literally what drive mindshare and volume... look at NFTs, speculative defi applications etc.\n\nSustainable is subjective, there was hardly any fees generated in the bear market for Ethereum. Crypto's main usecase is still speculation (and stables.. look at tron, eth will do well here). Casinos in real life are still thriving.. look at vegas.\n\nInternational institutions - it depends on the use case. Look at Ethena's new L1 that is centralized by design.

The speaker delves into hypothetical future scenarios, stake distribution, cost reduction incentives, and the implications of issuance adjustments on stakers and the network. The discussion also touches on the impact of parameterizing reward curves, governance processes for agreeing on new issuance curves, and the need for consolidation incentives in the absence of MEV burn in orbit ssf design.

The speaker delves into hypothetical future scenarios, stake distribution, cost reduction incentives, and the implications of issuance adjustments on stakers and the network. The discussion also touches on the impact of parameterizing reward curves, governance processes for agreeing on new issuance curves, and the need for consolidation incentives in the absence of MEV burn in orbit ssf design. There is emphasis on seeking fair solutions and community support for sustainable economic activity on Ethereum. Additionally, the potential effects of institutional interest in staking and competition in the market are considered, highlighting the quest for balance and efficiency in the issuance policy for Ethereum.</p>\n\n<h2>Discussion Questions:</h2>\n\n<p>How might the implementation of consolidation incentives impact stake distribution and overall network security on Ethereum, especially in the absence of MEV burn in the orbit ssf design?</p>\n\n<p>What challenges and potential conflicts could arise when attempting to establish governance processes for agreeing on new issuance curves within the Ethereum community, and how can these be effectively navigated to ensure sustainable economic activity?</p>\n\n<p>Your mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

As is, ETH's inflation is lower than even BTCs. And is lower than almost any other asset on Earth, except stocks that see heavy buybacks. ETH is a very scarce asset in terms of its issuance.\n\n> But losing ultrasound and the rise of L2's kicked the second part in the balls and 'ETH is money' minus the ultrasound\n\nThe ultrasound meme was oversimplistic and misguided. There is no way to ensure Ethereum has negative issuance. In fact, a successful ETH that acquires monetary premium has positive inflation. These 2 things are one and the same. Monetary premium == positive inflation, burn it down onto your brains. They are the same. You cannot have monetary premium and deflation at the same time, they contradict each other. Because to have deflation means more ETH is being consumed for its commodity-like properties than is being minted, therefore it's not being hoarded which is exactly what having monetary premium means. Think about gold, it has monetary premium because its industrial use as a commodity is a very small chunk of its total production. All the rest is being hoarded in vaults and jewelry. Gold has a positive issuance.\n\n> /high revenue portion seems to not have had any legs to stand on.......\n\nThis is a different issue and something that needs to be fixed. Ethereum's fee adjustment algorithm both for the base fee and the blobs, needs a change. For a very simple reason, the current fee mechanism is designed for a long-term equilibrium between supply and demand where you only need to adjust for short-term bursts of demand. For that the existing mechanism works well and is very reactive.

As is, ETH&#39;s inflation is lower than even BTCs. And is lower than almost any other asset on Earth, except stocks that see heavy buybacks. ETH is a very scarce asset in terms of its issuance.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But losing ultrasound and the rise of L2&#39;s kicked the second part in the balls and &#39;ETH is money&#39; minus the ultrasound</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ultrasound meme was oversimplistic and misguided. There is no way to ensure Ethereum has negative issuance. In fact, a successful ETH that acquires monetary premium has positive inflation. These 2 things are one and the same. Monetary premium == positive inflation, burn it down onto your brains. They are the same. You cannot have monetary premium and deflation at the same time, they contradict each other. Because to have deflation means more ETH is being consumed for its commodity-like properties than is being minted, therefore it&#39;s not being hoarded which is exactly what having monetary premium means. Think about gold, it has monetary premium because its industrial use as a commodity is a very small chunk of its total production. All the rest is being hoarded in vaults and jewelry. Gold has a positive issuance.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>/high revenue portion seems to not have had any legs to stand on.......</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a different issue and something that needs to be fixed.

Of course L2 operators are not ossified yet - most are less than two years old, many of them less than one year old. They're still dialing their systems in and finding market fit.\n\nIf we consider for a moment where Ethereum would be today if we had ossified earlier, it becomes blindingly clear that Ethereum can't afford to ossify yet. And that comes with unfortunate, unavoidable trade-offs.\n\n> [The EF is] willingly breaking invariants like history permanence, and state permanence\n\nThese aren't really invariants - they've both been discussed since 2021. They've been on all the public roadmaps. Neither of them delete data permanently (archival services will always exist), they just make it unnecessary for full nodes to store all that data that they aren't using at all. That's a win for everyone as far as I understand it.\n\n> In 2021, at least, developers would have the support of ecosystem projects that would airdrop them tokens, which made me money on the side that I could spend on building Ethereum tooling. This is not the case anymore, and all airdrops go to some third-world grifter who is willing to take an entire day out of their week just to understand how they can grift their way into airdrop inclusion criteria.\n\nYeah, airdrops are gamed now, everything's bots and everything sucks, this is no one's fault though. It's an inevitability of human nature. Botting exists everywhere money exists.\n\nIf your income as an Ethereum dev relies on ecosystem projects airdropping you, I feel like that was always a tenuous income path. Much more reliable to either get hired or create something profitable yourself. The airdrops were probably meant to jump-start you into something independently profitable, anyways.\n\n> The EF and other involved parties are not interested in fixing the Ethereum price in the short term. Often as an Ethereum developer I would be able to pay for improving the ecosystem with my bag appreciating, but Ether practically hasn't appreciated and I would have had to be a really good trader to cash out on some of the local tops along the way in the last few years.\n\nSad days price is down, yeah it sucks for all of us, but is it really the Ethereum Foundation's job to \"fix the price of ETH in the short term\"? That's absurd to me. I thought the point was that Ethereum is perhaps the only chain that doesn't sell out its long term goals for short term price appreciation.\n\nThis sticks out as by far the most problematic part of the tweet to me. \"Fixing the price in the short term\" is something we all need to actively resist, insomuch as it means to sacrifice Ethereum's long term goals and vision so that it might become a lifeless husk ten or twenty years from now.\n\n> I don't think this question is easily answered by just saying that you can still run an archive node or use torrents. When all history which is older than a year gets expired this obviously also changes the node requirements and again it changes entirely how you have to reason through the system and so on.\n\nHow does history expiry change how you have to \"reason through the system\"? What specific applications? What dapp are you building where you need to know, in real-time, which transactions happened more than a year ago?\n\nI really do think that the question is answered by just saying you can still run an archive node or use torrents. But I would really want to hear the arguments for this one.\n\n>  Interoperable ERC20s may be a first proof of concept of what an interoperable L2 would look like on the Superchain, but truly what developers want and what seemingly the EF and neither all of the L2 operators can provide developers is one unified system that just works.\n\nThe Open Intents Framework (ERC-7683) is currently solving the superchain problem. I wonder if OP has any issues with it. Or maybe he's just frustrated that it's not production ready yet?\n\n> Everything is constantly in flux and the EF's official declared goal is that they actually do not care about the lonesome developer. They care about the use cases which really change their consumer numbers on the L1 and the L2s.\n\nSorry, but mass adoption matters more than the \"lone developer\". Is the EF perfect? Definitely no, but we do need to start with things that \"really change the numbers\". That's how adoption happens.\n\nYes, things are still in flux. There still does not exist a scalable, neutral, reliable blockchain in the world. Ethereum is still in the process of growing to be that blockchain, so it still needs to be in flux in some ways.\n\nIn summary this tweet has some kernels of truth in it, but I find it to spend a long time ranting about things that aren't important, while hand-waving the most critical parts of its argument. I think some of it is due to salt that the \"call yourself a blockchain developer and don't ever worry about profitability\" gravy train is starting to end.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think dev experience is important, but this particular tweet feels a bit complainy and pessimistic to me.

This is not the case anymore, and all airdrops go to some third-world grifter who is willing to take an entire day out of their week just to understand how they can grift their way into airdrop inclusion criteria.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, airdrops are gamed now, everything&#39;s bots and everything sucks, this is no one&#39;s fault though. It&#39;s an inevitability of human nature. Botting exists everywhere money exists.</p>\n\n<p>If your income as an Ethereum dev relies on ecosystem projects airdropping you, I feel like that was always a tenuous income path. Much more reliable to either get hired or create something profitable yourself. The airdrops were probably meant to jump-start you into something independently profitable, anyways.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The EF and other involved parties are not interested in fixing the Ethereum price in the short term. Often as an Ethereum developer I would be able to pay for improving the ecosystem with my bag appreciating, but Ether practically hasn&#39;t appreciated and I would have had to be a really good trader to cash out on some of the local tops along the way in the last few years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sad days price is down, yeah it sucks for all of us, but is it really the Ethereum Foundation&#39;s job to &quot;fix the price of ETH in the short term&quot;? That&#39;s absurd to me. I thought the point was that Ethereum is perhaps the only chain that doesn&#39;t sell out its long term goals for short term price appreciation.</p>\n\n<p>This sticks out as by far the most problematic part of the tweet to me. &quot;Fixing the price in the short term&quot; is something we all need to actively resist, insomuch as it means to sacrifice Ethereum&#39;s long term goals and vision so that it might become a lifeless husk ten or twenty years from now.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t think this question is easily answered by just saying that you can still run an archive node or use torrents. When all history which is older than a year gets expired this obviously also changes the node requirements and again it changes entirely how you have to reason through the system and so on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How does history expiry change how you have to &quot;reason through the system&quot;? What specific applications? What dapp are you building where you need to know, in real-time, which transactions happened more than a year ago?</p>\n\n<p>I really do think that the question is answered by just saying you can still run an archive node or use torrents. But I would really want to hear the arguments for this one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interoperable ERC20s may be a first proof of concept of what an interoperable L2 would look like on the Superchain, but truly what developers want and what seemingly the EF and neither all of the L2 operators can provide developers is one unified system that just works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Open Intents Framework (ERC-7683) is currently solving the superchain problem. I wonder if OP has any issues with it. Or maybe he&#39;s just frustrated that it&#39;s not production ready yet?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything is constantly in flux and the EF&#39;s official declared goal is that they actually do not care about the lonesome developer. They care about the use cases which really change their consumer numbers on the L1 and the L2s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sorry, but mass adoption matters more than the &quot;lone developer&quot;. Is the EF perfect? Definitely no, but we do need to start with things that &quot;really change the numbers&quot;. That&#39;s how adoption happens.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, things are still in flux. There still does not exist a scalable, neutral, reliable blockchain in the world. Ethereum is still in the process of growing to be that blockchain, so it still needs to be in flux in some ways.</p>\n\n<p>In summary this tweet has some kernels of truth in it, but I find it to spend a long time ranting about things that aren&#39;t important, while hand-waving the most critical parts of its argument. I think some of it is due to salt that the &quot;call yourself a blockchain developer and don&#39;t ever worry about profitability&quot; gravy train is starting to end.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-09 10:21:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mm8t120","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1juyv98","parent_id":"t1_mm88sdi","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"Yep, this echoes a lot of what I'm feeling (nondev, but enthusiast) and what I know many small devs feel to an extent.
