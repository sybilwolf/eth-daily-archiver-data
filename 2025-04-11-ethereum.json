My dreams of a large house &amp; garden have been significantly scaled down...and today we are viewing houses significantly shitter than I had been researching before. ....I will have to face everyday that the small house I will live in is because of my own greed of not selling at 4,000. I know I shouldnt complain as a profit is a profit, I live in a safe country, etc etc,  but dam, this is taking some processing. AMA p.s as we rose above 4,000 last I transfered the ETH into the exchange to sell but only sold 1/4 of it, because greed told me it was going higher &#39;for sure&#39;...and I didnt set a stop loss, and watched it slowly drop to todays levels. stick to your plan guys, my pain and regret huuuuurts. p.s still bullish lol</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-11 05:42:54","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-04-11 05:49:45","id":"mmjy2tp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jwiyn9","parent_id":"t3_1jwiyn9","score":31,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/mild-blue-yonder","body":"You made life changing money and actually changed your life.

They explained the process of identifying solo stakers through correlations between public keys and IP addresses, emphasizing the role of the Trusted MAV relay and the vulnerability it introduces. The attack poses threats to network resilience and highlights potential risks for solo stakers with limited network protection. The ease of obtaining IP addresses and the prevalence of MAV relay architecture among validators were also addressed, indicating potential vulnerabilities in the current staking system.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nWhat measures can solo stakers take to enhance their network protection and mitigate the risks associated with potential attacks like the one demonstrated in the presentation?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
