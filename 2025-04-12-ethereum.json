So, it is time to repost and improve and older post again to add some nuance to the term 'centralized rollups'. \n\nIn short, the super power rollups have is that they can be very centralized and still have most properties of the underlying decentralized L1 without having its overhead. That is why the rollup centric roadmap was generally agreed to be the way forward . \n\nLet me go into more detail:\n\nDecentralization is difficult to quantitatively define, but I guess most of us have an intuitive understanding of what it means, so I leave it at that. Decentralization in itself is not why we want to decentralize the network. We want to have properties which come with decentralization. These properties are:\n\n- Permissionlessness: Anyone can participate.\n\n- Trustlessness: You do not have to trust a central authority to make sure your funds are safe.\n\n- Immutability: Once a transaction is on chain it is difficult to revert it or even pretty much impossible after the block has been finalized a few minutes later.\n\n- Censorship resistance: No single entity/state actor can apply pressure to prevent certain users to use the network or prevent interaction with certain contracts.\n\n- Resilience: Local outages cannot harm the network at all.\n\n- Security: No one can move your funds without having access to your private key.\n\n- Transparency. Anyone can verify that the transactions have been applied correctly.\n\nRollups can achieve these properties without having to have tens of thousands of validating nodes running all around the world. Rollups leverage the following methods:\n\n- Trustlessness and Security: Fraud proofs or zk proofs directly give you trustlessness and security. A centralized sequencer cannot move your funds as long as a fraud proof system is there. This gives you the same security as on L1. No decentralization necessary.\n\n- Immutability: With posting state roots to the L1 the rollups cannot revert transactions anymore as they would have to attack the L1. This gives us immutability. The larger rollups (Base, Arbitrum and Optimism) post state roots every minute or 5 minutes. This means we get immutability on pretty much the same level as on L1. No decentralization necessary.\n\n- Censorship resistance: If you have escape hatches and forced transaction inclusion in the smart contract on L1 we can have censorship resistance even with a single centralized sequencer. Sure it is not real-time censorship resistance, but for most practical purposes good enough to prevent censorship as any attempt to censor can be circumvented through the L1.  No decentralization necessary.\n\n- Transparency: Publishing transaction data in blobs lets anyone follow the current state of the rollup. No decentralisation necessary.\n\n- Permissionlessness: Forced transaction inclusion from L1 allows anyone to make transactions on the rollup without any sequencer being able to stop you from participating. Not the best user experience, but possible to do. \n\nHere are some places where a small level of decentralisation will help to improve the rollup or the user experience on the rollup. To be clear rollups can achieve the following properties with way lower number of sequencers than any L1 can. Think a dozen, compared to several thousands or even tens of thousands for an L1.\n\n- Improve Permissionlessness: This can be done by increasing and distributing the number of sequencers in a unpermissioned or even permissioned way. As long as multiple entities are allowed to sequence and they are in different jurisdictions they are not beholden to a single entity. This makes access to the network permissionless. There do not need to be thousands of sequencers to achieve that. A handful are enough. This will improve the user experience from a simple fully centralized rollup which only has forced transaction inclusion.\n\n- Resilience: Having more than 1 centralized sequencer massively increases the resilience. Again, a handful (< 10) are enough. Some rollups also have the property that if no new state roots have been proposed for some time they become permissionless and anyone can then jump in to become a sequencer.\n\n- Real time censorship: A more decentralized sequencer set can help in real-time censorship resistance, but it is technically not necessary for general censorship resistance.\n\n\nAre rollups the infinitely scalable, resilient, permissionless and censorship-free utopia that we set out to build a few years ago? No, we are not really there yet. The bigger ones like Arbitrum and OP mainnet are pretty close to it though. They give you most of the security Ethereum mainnet provides. That is why I personally do not feel too nervous to have a large portion of my stuff on these two. Base has improved on most of the technically solvable issues, but severely lacks in their governance part, which defines how fast the bridge contracts can be upgraded and how the security council is organized. I hope zk rollups will improve a lot more in the coming year. They still have ways to go though.\n\nBased rollups by nature bring a larger level of decentralization compared to 'normal' rollups do, so they have better permissionlessness, resilience and real-time censorship properties out of the box. \n\nNative rollups will get rid of security councils and limit bridge contract upgrades, which for me is more important than the advantages based rollups bring, but this will take some time to get implemented properly.\n\nIn summary, if you think about it, it is pretty mind blowing being able to transact through centralized sequencers and still being able to have most of the advantages a fully decentralized L1 gives you but at an orders of magnitude higher scale. The rollup centric roadmap is so elegant and well thought through.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In the last few days I have read the term &#39;centralized rollups&#39;, which was meant to discredit certain rollups, too often.

This was demonstrated when soneium tried to censor certain memecoin trades. Someone forced their swaps to be included and it worked. Pretty powerful message, that even Sony cannot censor on their own chain. These are cypherpunk values at its best. Escape hatches and similar mechanisms have been so normalized that any serious project has to have them, at least on the roadmap. Depending on the exact implementation they also allow to process transactions even if the sequencer is down.\n\nIf you go to the risk analysis subpage of L2beat (https://l2 beat.com/scaling/risk) you can sort how different Rollups and L2 handle sequencer and proposer failures. The large 3 are not an issue here and many other have a mechanism as well, interestingly zk rollups do not.\n\nIt totally agree with the upgradeable bridge contracts and their upgrade windows. That is the real issue in my opinion.\n\nAnd a small but important correction, rollups post all the necessary information to rebuild the state of the rollup on Ethereum, not just summarized data.

They discussed the challenges of achieving scalability while maintaining data security and integrity, underscoring the significance of layer 2 technologies in addressing these issues. The speaker also touched upon the potential of optimistic rollups and zk-rollups in enhancing scalability and security on the Ethereum blockchain, providing insights on their respective benefits and limitations.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How can the Ethereum community collaborate to improve on-chain data availability for Layer 2 solutions and enhance the scalability of the network while preserving data security and integrity?\n\n\n\n2. In what ways do optimistic rollups and zk-rollups offer practical solutions to the scalability and security challenges faced by the Ethereum blockchain, and what considerations should developers keep in mind when implementing these technologies?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

The difficulty bomb made it exponentially more difficult to mine new blocks after some predefined date.

With the difficulty in place, they would have to have at least a minimal amount of coordination and invest some time into preparing an upgrade to removes the difficulty bomb. Not impossible, but more difficult than without it. It was assumed that the difficulty bomb is enough to dissuade miners to step out of line.\n\nI am not sure how such a mechanism can help with L2s. An L2 is just a smart contract on L1. There is nothing anyone can do to prevent a new L2 from being deployed. All the metrics you are suggesting are also off chain metrics, so there is no simple way to measure them and for the Network to know about the state of them. This means you need a committee of people to judge bridge contracts and their associated L2s according to qualitative metrics and then somehow punish the contracts on the L1. Not something I think is feasible without breaking some of the core values that Ethereum has.\n\nWhat can be done however is that we come up with better alternatives to the most simple and unsafe L2 designs. And that is what happened with the rollup centric roadmap. Rollups are only possible thanks to the introduction of Blobs. Rollups can give a much better security than L2s which in turn means, rollup providers might be able to get paid more because the transactions have more value. We see this when looking at the TVLs of Rollups vs L2s. Rollups are more successful than L2s and this did not happen by accident. In the fully developed version of the rollup centric roadmap the Ethereum L1 will also receive more revenue and in turn burn more ETH, but to get there we need more rollup transactions for a stable blob fee market to develop. \n\nL2beat is then doing a marvelous job to then track these qualitative metrics of the rollups and distill them down into a simple pie chart style risk analysis. Anyone can see how dangerous it is to use a certain rollup. Then there is also how the community talks and uses rollups. I keep my stuff mostly on Arbitrum and some on OP mainnet, because I think the other rollups are not secure enough. Vitalik will not mention stage 0 rollups at all, except if they are new, then they have a certain grace period. So to get to the point. This kind of discussion style and the prevalence of optimism collective rollups normalized that we have escape hatches and forced transaction inclusion in even the newest rollups. Which is great and leaves us in the much better place than if we would just have let L2s happen.\n\nFurther down the development roadmap we have based rollups which shifts part of the revenue stream from the rollup provider to the L1. In my understanding based rollups have not proven themselves to be economically sustainable for the providers or have a better UX for the users, so they still have some way to go before the get there. There is a lot of work on improving that.\n\nThe only thing which I see problematic are the governance councils who define how and when to upgrade the bridge contract. All other purely technical solutions have been implemented by all of the larges rollups (yes, even by Base). But the governance part seems to be very difficult and that is why Arbitrum is not a stage 2 rollup yet, same with OP mainnet and Base, but these two are even further behind. \n\nTo solve the governance issues, there is a plan to have native rollups further in the future. Native rollups give a much better security out of the box than all the other rollup designs, but they still are in the drawing board stage and we need some technological advancements like zk proof generation speed for native rollups to become viable. Definitely possible, but just not today. Hopefully in a year we will have some early versions of native rollups.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The difficult bomb was part of Ethereum as a safeguard against miners not playing along with upgrades.

All other purely technical solutions have been implemented by all of the larges rollups (yes, even by Base). But the governance part seems to be very difficult and that is why Arbitrum is not a stage 2 rollup yet, same with OP mainnet and Base, but these two are even further behind. </p>\n\n<p>To solve the governance issues, there is a plan to have native rollups further in the future. Native rollups give a much better security out of the box than all the other rollup designs, but they still are in the drawing board stage and we need some technological advancements like zk proof generation speed for native rollups to become viable. Definitely possible, but just not today. Hopefully in a year we will have some early versions of native rollups.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-12 12:38:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mms72jy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jxalb3","parent_id":"t1_mmrujsn","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"One of the benefits of L2s is expressivity and one of the reasons they aren't all stage 2 is because they're leading the way and not all are the same so just because one becomes stage 2 doesn't mean they all can.
