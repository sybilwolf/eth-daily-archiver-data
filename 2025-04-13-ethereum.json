As one of Asia's leading virtual asset exchanges, HashKey Exchange received approval from the Hong Kong SFC on April 10, becoming one of the first exchanges in Hong Kong authorized to provide staking services.\n\nAs the SFC stated in the announcement: \"In setting out its regulatory approach, the SFC recognises the potential benefits of staking in enhancing the security of blockchain networks and allowing investors to earn yields on virtual assets within a regulated market environment.\" In February this year, the SFC released its \"Virtual Asset Development Roadmap\" (the \"A-S-P-I-Re\" framework), proposing the expansion of virtual asset products under a clear regulatory framework, including staking, leverage, and lending services. Less than two months after the roadmap's introduction, the SFC has already implemented the policy, demonstrating its strong support for the virtual asset industry.\n\nTerence Pu, Managing Director of HashKey Exchange, stated: \"This approval marks a milestone in Hong Kong's regulatory innovation for virtual assets.

I've been tinkering with it and I definitely see the potential. Classic bots are straightforward, you program them to do a job and they do it. Llm bots are kind of that on steroids, instead of programming them to do a task, you train them on the expected outcome, teaching them with text and examples about how the markets work, and then you wire them to the network so they can act on what they know and develop even more knowledge. It requires some fairly robust hardware, but someone who was committed enough could start with what they have in front of them until they reached a point that more hardware was necessary.\n\nI have been able to accomplish 95% of this just by messing with chatGPT, so if I'm this close to success I know that someone with more time or robust technical skills could cross the finish line more quickly. \n\nSo it's like this.

The power of the model you can run is determined by your gpu. The models I could run on my 3080 seemed like a kindergartner, the models I'm running on my 5090 seem much more competent.\n\nOnce you get the llm interface running, you just talk to it, train it, send it data and examples of what interests you. The more you interact with it, the smarter it gets. Someone who is a genius will find a way to import nft trading data, or mev data, or something else useful to them. Even better, direct a stream of useful data into the box for real time learning.\n\nThe big leap I haven't crossed yet is wiring it to the network. This might sound difficult to us, but given the support of chatgpt i think it's well within grasp.

The session covered topics such as account recovery, relayers for sending transactions on-chain, the creation of a registry, and using ZK circuits to generate email proofs. Dimitri from ZK email showcased a registry where blueprints could be created for proving statements about emails. Attendees were guided on creating proofs about emails, utilizing these blueprints, and interacting with the SDK through TypeScript demos.\n\n\n\nLater in the session, the focus shifted towards integrating email-triggered transactions on-chain. The demonstration emphasized using an email-off contract that allowed commands triggered by email replies to execute on-chain transactions. The process involved users replying to specific emails, relayers sending ZK proofs, and contracts executing defined commands based on email interactions. Attendees were encouraged to explore the provided SDKs for specific functionality like account recovery, email signing, Oauth login, and email wallet. People were also introduced to the option of self-hosting the relayer infrastructure. Additionally, attendees were directed to the ZK email booth for further assistance, where they could seek help in getting their email proofs compiled and operations integrated.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nHow can the integration of email-triggered transactions on-chain enhance user experience and expand the utility of Ethereum blockchain technology?\n\n\n\nWhat are the potential challenges and security considerations involved in utilizing ZK circuits to generate email proofs for on-chain transactions, and how can developers address them effectively?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
