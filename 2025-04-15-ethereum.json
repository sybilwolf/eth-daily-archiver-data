The outage, caused by a connectivity issue in AWS&#39;s Tokyo data center, led to temporary suspensions of withdrawals and trading issues on these platforms. Binance resumed withdrawals shortly after, but users still faced trading problems. Other services like Rabby and DeBank also reported outages linked to AWS disruptions. This incident, reported by CoinDesk, highlights the crypto industry&#39;s reliance on centralized infrastructure, potentially impacting Ethereum trading and raising concerns about decentralization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[L1 Ethereum Transactions Per Day]</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1.252M</strong> transactions/day for Apr 14 2025 up from 1.133M from one year ago</p>\n\n<p><strong>[L2 Ethereum Transactions]</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>| Chain        | Yesterday | 24h Change | 30d Change | 1y Change |\n| ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |\n| Base         | 7.94M     | +4.3%      | +13%       | +204%     |\n| Arbitrum One | 1.85M     | +6.0%      | +39%       | -3.1%     |\n| Celo         | 1.26M     | +2.8%      | +40%       | +334%     |\n| Soneium      | 1.18M     | +11%       | -21.0%     | \u2014         |\n| Gravity      | 603.07k   | +3.2%      | -15.1%     | \u2014         |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>[TVL from top 5 projects]</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>| Project       | TVL ($)   | Daily Change (%) |\n|---------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Arbitrum One  | 10.66B    | \u2b06 4.46%          |\n| Base          | 10.15B    | \u2b06 5.73%          |\n| OP Mainnet    | 3.30B     | \u2b06 5.85%          |\n| ZKsync Era    | 506.44M   | \u2b07 2.96%          |\n| Starknet      | 423.25M   | \u2b06 0.46%          |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>[Ongoing events]</strong><br/>\n<strong>-</strong> BUIDL Asia April 15-16 | @buidl_asia on X</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-15 11:30:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mn9yv1h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jzklxj","parent_id":"t3_1jzklxj","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Ethzenn","body":"**Day 76 of buying 0.1 ETH daily until we reach All Time High**\n\nObtained 7.6 ETH for an average price of $2,230 per coin.\n\nValue of my ETH is -26.4%  \nIf I purchased BTC instead, I'd be -4.3%  \nIf I purchased SOL instead, I'd be -13.5%\n\n6 stETH Mainnet:\u00a0[ethzenn.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/ethzenn.eth#asset-multichain)  \n1.6 ETH Ink L2:\u00a0[ink.ethzenn](https://explorer.inkonchain.com/address/ethzenn.eth)  \n\\~Today is the best day to buy ETH\n\n[cryptle.io/eth](http://cryptle.io/eth) \\#35 5/5  \n\ud83d\udfe5 \ud83d\udfe7 \ud83d\udfe7 \ud83d\udfe8 \ud83d\udfe9","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Day 76 of buying 0.1 ETH daily until we reach All Time High</strong></p>\n\n<p>Obtained 7.6 ETH for an average price of $2,230 per coin.</p>\n\n<p>Value of my ETH is -26.4%<br/>\nIf I purchased BTC instead, I&#39;d be -4.3%<br/>\nIf I purchased SOL instead, I&#39;d be -13.5%</p>\n\n<p>6 stETH Mainnet:\u00a0<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/ethzenn.eth#asset-multichain\">ethzenn.eth</a><br/>\n1.6 ETH Ink L2:\u00a0<a href=\"https://explorer.inkonchain.com/address/ethzenn.eth\">ink.ethzenn</a><br/>\n~Today is the best day to buy ETH</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cryptle.io/eth\">cryptle.io/eth</a> #35 5/5<br/>\n\ud83d\udfe5 \ud83d\udfe7 \ud83d\udfe7 \ud83d\udfe8 \ud83d\udfe9</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-15 01:42:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mn7b984","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jzklxj","parent_id":"t3_1jzklxj","score":43,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/bitcoinjethsus","body":"How are we down twice as much as flippin SOL over the last 10 weeks?

They provided a refresher on public infrastructure and how certification authorities can issue certificates for encryption. The speaker, who is Mexican, shared insights on using government-certified credentials for digital signatures, citing a United Nations model law from 2001. In Mexico, the government has certified around 24 million individuals and 2 million businesses with private keys, allowing for self-sovereign account creation. The speaker emphasized the global presence of public infrastructure enabling crypto services, mentioning Spain's use of RSA keys and the need for updates in cryptographic standards. Attendees asked questions about securing private keys and the impact of private key adoption in Mexico, highlighting its use in legal documents and tax purposes.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How can the integration of government-certified credentials and private keys in digital signatures impact the adoption and trust in blockchain technologies, especially in regions like Mexico with a large user base of certified individuals and businesses?\n\n\n\n2.
