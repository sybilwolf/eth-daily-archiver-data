The Discovery Tool is used for research projects and solving various issues, with a focus on L2 solutions. They highlighted challenges and solutions related to project tracking, data correctness, and update monitoring. Moreover, they demonstrated the use of templates in standardizing data, integrating automatic field severity assignments, and managing template associations with specific contracts. The speaker showcased practical implementations such as categorizing severity, monitoring contract changes, and organizing templates for efficient project management within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How can the integration of automated field severity assignments improve efficiency and accuracy in managing research projects within the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n2. In what ways do standardized templates contribute to better data correctness and tracking in the development of L2 solutions on Ethereum?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

By not trying to do anything, they avoided any metrics, any measurements of performance/success. You can't compete with a pet rock. There's no way to outperform a pet rock. It just is. \n\nWhat hurts ETH is that it's trying to accomplish things. Which opens it up to competing L1s trying to do those things better. Money that would've flowed to ETH has flowed to alt L1s, it's flowed to L2s, and other projects. \n\nIf ETH had no competition, it would've flipped BTC by now because the market understands that ETH is better than BTC. We saw that when ETH almost flipped BTC in 2017. But, then, the competition came flooding in and the ratio has been bleeding ever since. \n\nETH needs to win to flip BTC. It needs to become THE L1 and everything else has to die.
