Monero was hailed (and IMO) still is supposed to be what BTC is. BTC maxis were defending Bitcoin&#39;s long term viability via solutions like lightning, and any talks about smart contracts are considered a fad. </p>\n\n<p>ICOs were mostly grifts, now we have memecoins so I guess grifting doesn&#39;t change.</p>\n\n<p>Now in 2025 the focus seems to be about speed and how cheap things can be. No concerns regarding how cheap fees can lead to centralization, DoS attacks. No talk about concerns on state growth, no talk about being able to store the whole state (full node vs light node) and able to verify it. No talk about not your keys, not your coins. BTC maxis have resigned their fate to Saylor and governments to buy their bags, BTC is no longer P2P cash, but it&#39;s electronic gold or whatever the cult feels like calling it now.</p>\n\n<p>I am however, thankful that EF and the Ethereum community is rallying to start playing ball, especially since more deregulation started with the change in the US administration. We are starting to play the same game, not staying and circlejerking in our own safe space. Hoping to see more coming out of the community to combat FUD, and show that Ethereum is stil THE best protocol for the backbone of financial world. It is the most secure, decentralized, and neutral. It SCALED, and it will scale more.</p>\n\n<p>There is no second best.

It's important to follow the steps accurately to ensure the successful execution of the tests on the live network. The process involves creating contracts, deploying smart contracts, setting up transactions, validating test outcomes, and ensuring that the tests match the expected results. Additionally, modifications and interactions with the blockchain are demonstrated, showcasing how tests can be extended to multiple contracts and internal calls, ultimately leading to the successful execution and validation of the tests. Participants are encouraged to actively engage in executing the provided commands and observing the test outcomes to gain practical understanding of executing tests on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe speaker discussed conducting tests on Ethereum blockchain technologies, specifically focusing on transactions and smart contracts. The importance of testing for consensus among different clients was highlighted, as failing to do so can lead to split chains. The process of creating and implementing tests for new Ethereum improvement proposals (EIP) was detailed, with a focus on testing scenarios such as sending funds, stack underflow, and using specific op codes. The speaker emphasized the open nature of tests in the Ethereum ecosystem, encouraging community involvement in verifying and improving test cases. Additionally, information about job opportunities for protocol testing roles within Ethereum was shared, along with a reminder to report issues responsibly to remain eligible for any rewards.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can conducting thorough tests on transactions and smart contracts contribute to maintaining consensus among different clients in the Ethereum network, and prevent the occurrence of split chains?\n\n- In what ways do you think the open nature of tests in the Ethereum ecosystem fosters community involvement and contributes to the verification and improvement of test cases for Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs)?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

If it can't come in Pectra, then let's do a fork right after, 1 month after. This is a stop gap measure while we prepare to introduce a cleaner solution like EIP-7918. It buys us time while we keep scaling blobs with Pectra and raise the L1 gas. We have killed endogenous demand for ETH, and the price action and constant brigading is killing exogenous demand for ETH. The current fee update mechanism is not apt for the scaling regime, that's all. It's designed to quickly adapt price to short-term changes in demand around a stable equilibrium between supply and demand. But it sends prices to 0 when we are aggressively scaling supply, and we want to scale aggressively therefore we need to patch this up immediately. Let's make this happen. /u/aelowsson , /u/adietrichs , /u/vbuterin .\n\nStep 3. Scale Ethereum aggressively. Scale the L1 aggressively, scale blobs aggressively.

We just need to fix with step 2 a mismatch between the fee price update mechanism and the scaling roadmap.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum is under attack and we allowed it to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Step 1. Clean up the brigading, ban recurrent offenders. If you read this forum, downvote and report. If you are a mod, clean up and ban. Drive-by posting and non-constructive posts break <a href=\"/r/Ethereum\">/r/Ethereum</a> rules.</p>\n\n<p>Step 2. Introduce a min blob fee of ~ 1 GWei and a min gas fee of ~ 1 GWei ASAP. If it can&#39;t come in Pectra, then let&#39;s do a fork right after, 1 month after. This is a stop gap measure while we prepare to introduce a cleaner solution like EIP-7918. It buys us time while we keep scaling blobs with Pectra and raise the L1 gas. We have killed endogenous demand for ETH, and the price action and constant brigading is killing exogenous demand for ETH. The current fee update mechanism is not apt for the scaling regime, that&#39;s all. It&#39;s designed to quickly adapt price to short-term changes in demand around a stable equilibrium between supply and demand. But it sends prices to 0 when we are aggressively scaling supply, and we want to scale aggressively therefore we need to patch this up immediately. Let&#39;s make this happen. <a href=\"/u/aelowsson\">/u/aelowsson</a> , <a href=\"/u/adietrichs\">/u/adietrichs</a> , <a href=\"/u/vbuterin\">/u/vbuterin</a> .</p>\n\n<p>Step 3. Scale Ethereum aggressively. Scale the L1 aggressively, scale blobs aggressively. Don&#39;t be FUDded out of the long-term vision, it&#39;s sound.
