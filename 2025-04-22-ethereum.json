Eels aims to answer key questions about adding new blocks to the blockchain and changes in the chain's state precisely. By optimizing for readability and providing extensive documentation, Eels serves as a playground for prototyping new EIPs, making it easier for researchers to experiment and for client developers to have tests readily available. The goal is to streamline the EIP development process and integrate Eels into the EIP process to ensure all EIP implementations and updates happen efficiently. The team also welcomed contributions and highlighted tools for testing Eel behavior without implementing CL changes.\n\n\n\nThe presentation outlined how Eels leverages Python to specify the execution layer, organizes different hard forks in a structured manner for readability, and offers a diffing tool to track changes between consecutive forks. Additionally, the team encouraged integrating Eels into projects using EVM back ends and implementing EIPs on Eels for feedback and improvement. Overall, Eels aims to facilitate the development and testing of EIPs while enhancing collaboration between researchers and client developers in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can leveraging Eels and integrating it into projects using EVM back ends enhance the efficiency of EIP development and testing processes within the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n- In what ways does the use of Python for specifying the execution layer and the organization of hard forks in a structured manner contribute to the readability and effectiveness of Eels for prototyping new EIPs?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

Eels aims to answer key questions about adding new blocks to the blockchain and changes in the chain&#39;s state precisely. By optimizing for readability and providing extensive documentation, Eels serves as a playground for prototyping new EIPs, making it easier for researchers to experiment and for client developers to have tests readily available. The goal is to streamline the EIP development process and integrate Eels into the EIP process to ensure all EIP implementations and updates happen efficiently. The team also welcomed contributions and highlighted tools for testing Eel behavior without implementing CL changes.</p>\n\n<p>The presentation outlined how Eels leverages Python to specify the execution layer, organizes different hard forks in a structured manner for readability, and offers a diffing tool to track changes between consecutive forks. Additionally, the team encouraged integrating Eels into projects using EVM back ends and implementing EIPs on Eels for feedback and improvement. Overall, Eels aims to facilitate the development and testing of EIPs while enhancing collaboration between researchers and client developers in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h2>Discussion Questions:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>How can leveraging Eels and integrating it into projects using EVM back ends enhance the efficiency of EIP development and testing processes within the Ethereum ecosystem?</p></li>\n<li><p>In what ways does the use of Python for specifying the execution layer and the organization of hard forks in a structured manner contribute to the readability and effectiveness of Eels for prototyping new EIPs?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
