Lower compliance costs, faster settlement, and 24/7 access\u2014all things traditional finance can\u2019t achieve without blockchain.\nWhile TXSE hasn\u2019t confirmed Ethereum integration, it makes perfect sense for it to have some sort of blockchain integration and potentially as a L2? (Fast, cheap and secure with them having more control of the chain). BlackRock is already building on Ethereum and stated it is \u201cthe default.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd39 4. Citadel Is Allegedly Holding a $3B Short Position on ETH\nAlready mentioned by some folks here (maybe some of the onchain explorers here could show the source) and although this isn\u2019t confirmed through public filings (since crypto is less transparent), but the rumor aligns with Citadel\u2019s prior history\u2014see GME, where they aggressively shorted and manipulated media sentiment while controlling order flow.\nIf true, this short could suppress ETH price in the short-term\u2014while accumulation happens quietly OTC or via ETFs and tokenized products. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Final Thoughts\nThis isn&#39;t guaranteed, therefore THEORY\u2014but the incentives line up too well. It&#39;s not crazy to think we&#39;re watching a coordinated long-term play by institutions, who have both the capital and time horizon to make it work.\nIf anyone has hard data on the Citadel short (on-chain or CEX flow analysis), would love to see it added here.\nETH today feels less like a dying asset and more like early TCP/IP \u2014 boring to the masses, but about to become the rails everything runs on.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-23 00:43:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mokmrsv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1k5s1dr","parent_id":"t3_1k5s1dr","score":34,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"I would say that this is likely.

It emphasized the challenges posed by fragmented digital identities controlled by a few corporations, advocating for decentralized solutions.

They also presented features such as privacy-preserving proof of uniqueness and decentralized trustless issuance, showcasing how Prado ID can unify identities across different chains and devices. The session concluded with a Q&A discussing organizational identity support, key management, UI challenges in data disclosure, and comparisons with other identity solutions like World ID.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can decentralized solutions like Prado ID address the challenges associated with fragmented digital identities controlled by corporations in the Web3 space?\n\n- In what ways could the integration of self-sovereign identity solutions, such as Prado ID, impact the future of online identity management and privacy protection for users in a decentralized ecosystem?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
