Power outages that usually never happen. Internet going down which usually never happens. I of course picked the clients with bugs and was down because of that. Plus my validator went down several times just like that. The VPN that came with dappnode never really worked for me, so fixing meant being at home. When the validator is online usually that's obviously no problem, but with the several downtimes this lead to be stressful. \n\nSince the hardware now doesn't even boot correctly I think this is a sign that I shall stop validating.

The goal was to learn and I learned a lot. But with no hardware, little luck when it comes to proposing blocks, the MEV lottery ending at one point or another and tax disadvantages I think it's just time to end this project and experiment. I was and still am proud, it is cool validate, it is rewarding to see attestations coming in and of course the few block proposals are a thrill.
