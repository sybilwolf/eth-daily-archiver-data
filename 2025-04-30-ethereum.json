When Ryan went on hiatus it only went down faster. I always had issues with how much David understands the technology, but to be fair, not everyone has to know the ins and outs of Ethereum. I also do not. But it was a bit wild to hear him talking about scaling in one of the rollups this year and making the statement that pectra does not include any blob scaling (which it does) and then trying to make the point that Ethereum does not scale. He then got corrected off-mic but did not walk back his argument. That is pretty bad. \n\nIn one of the last podcast he apparently did not even know that the next Ethereum upgrade is called pectra. Not sure why anyone whose goal is to educate will be able to do so when he has no concept of what is going on.\n\nThere was also a long interaction with him on the daily gwei discord in the last few days where he said that rollups (or L2s) are 95% the same as an alt L1. When challenged about this opinion he did not really get into where he gets this 95% from or what it even means.\n\nNo idea where he gets his information from, but to me it sounds to be very biased, without any proper foundation and often outright wrong.
