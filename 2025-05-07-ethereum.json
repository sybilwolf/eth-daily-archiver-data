This upgrade combines the Prague execution layer hard fork and the Electra consensus layer upgrade, incorporating 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). Key enhancements include:\n\n* **Smart Accounts and Delegation (EIP-7702):** This EIP introduces smart contract capabilities to wallets, improving user experience by enabling features like gas fee payments in alternative cryptocurrencies. Experts, such as Daniel Lehrner, noted, \u201cEIP-7702 brings Wallet UX to the next level. It is a big step in making blockchains available to the masses.\u201d\n* **Validator Consolidation (EIP-7251):** The maximum effective balance for validators increased from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, allowing for validator consolidation.

We might as well forget about the upcoming gas limit increases, which would become largely pointless if the average block size doesn't exceed 25 Million due to a fee floor. As a side effect of Ethereum regularly running under capacity, clients wouldn't necessarily fail early under routine network load, so they could start failing instead during periods of network stress in a correlated way.\n\n* Lower value transactions become non-viable on Ethereum L1, pushing them to L2 or to alternative L1s. This fragments ETH's network effect, limits long-term revenue gains, and threatens Ethereum's long-term success.\n\n* Ethereum loses a measurable amount of credible neutrality, because devs/stakers gain access to a contentious new network parameter that has extreme potential effects on the profitability and viability of use cases and entire companies.

But let's be real, nobody actually cares whether ETH is deflationary on time scales shorter than decades. Every other coin that is outperforming ETH has much higher inflation. When ETH price is down, people think ETH sucks whether it's inflationary or deflationary. When ETH price is up, everybody piles in whether it's inflationary or deflationary. In the long term, gas prices will go up if Ethereum succeeds - no fee floor needed.\n\n* Burn revenue. Let's say - conservatively - that we have ten more years until Ethereum sees wide adoption, fulfills its ultimate use cases, and runs at 100% capacity at maximum scaling with fee price discovery. And let's say that 1559 reform could reliably generate about 0.25% per year in net fee burn (net burn hit about 0.37% at its 2023-2024 peak). In total, after ten years, we would be able to burn 2.5% of ETH supply before the reform becomes obsolete.

The cycle will never end and just like Bitcoin, Ethereum is inherently bullish mathematically speaking.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-05-06 23:50:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mr0xiue","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1kgq8a7","parent_id":"t1_mr0swar","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ThereIsNoGovernance","body":"You are a blind FOOL.\n\nWhy?\n\nOn the malicious CEXs and ETFs, they can pretend to dump ETH, whilst not selling a single gwei, (all accounts and txs are private, zero accountability).\n\nWe put our whale friends on the honest exchanges.
