The higher the gas limit, the more likely gas prices will spiral downward.\n\nEIP-1559 works well when there is sufficient demand, but it fails hard when the gas limit is much higher than demand. Many other EVM chains have had to implement minimum floor price for gas.\n\nWhat happens when L1 demand is insufficient, and gas price keeps falling from 1 Gwei to 10-100 Finney? Validators have very little control over setting base fees.
