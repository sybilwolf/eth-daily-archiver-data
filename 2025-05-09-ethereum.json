Ballard represented the Trump Organization on and off over the years and he\u2019s been a top fundraiser for the president\u2019s campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>His image as a Trump whisperer has allowed his firm to rack up a staggering 130 new clients since the November election, including Chevron, JP Morgan, Palantir, Netflix, Bayer, United Airlines and T-Mobile. In April, POLITICO\u2019s parent company, Axel Springer, hired Ballard Partners to engage with the administration.</p>\n\n<p>Ballard\u2019s firm hauled in $14 million during the first three months of 2025 \u2014 more than triple its lobbying revenues from the same time a year ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Crypto Czar David Sacks quickly became involved:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Within minutes of the president\u2019s posting, a furious David Sacks \u2014 the White House \u201ccrypto czar\u201d \u2014 called Wiles to complain, according to three people familiar with what occurred. The White House was hosting a crypto summit in Washington the following week, and it looked bad that the president was singling out some companies for praise but not others.</p>\n\n<p>Wiles, who hadn\u2019t been with the president that morning, started working the phones trying to find out what happened. Soon White House officials realized that one of the clients in the Truth Social post was Ballard\u2019s \u2014 and that the tweet hadn\u2019t even mentioned Trump\u2019s own budding crypto company.</p>\n\n<p>Trump would later follow up on the message in a second Truth Social post, adding the names of other crypto companies. But by then, it was too late \u2014 and Trump was furious.</p>\n\n<p>Trump\u2019s aides were incensed, too, accusing Ballard of assigning his employee to get Trump to hawk his client. One of them, a top aide to the president, called and yelled at Ballard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That second post mentioned Ethereum.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-05-09 02:11:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mre2ms7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1kibfzg","parent_id":"t1_mre1p6t","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/DayTraderBiH","body":"Interesting.

In the long term no matter how much we scale the L1 it might only be a small fraction of the whole L1 + Rollup throughput. Or in other words no matter how much we scale the L1, its contribution on the whole transaction throughput of the Ethereum network is only small. \n\nFor example Vitalik assumes we can get to 100k tps on rollups with Blobs. If we assume a 100 times scaling of the L1, we will still have 'only' about 2k tps on the L1. So if we assume that there was never any tps increase on the roadmap for the L1 (obviously a wrong assumption), then we are talking about a single digit percentage throughput increase for the whole Ethereum system by massively scaling the L1. If this tiny increase makes L3 unviable, they did not really have a good product market fit anyway. I would put the same argument forward for the rollups. If you include L2s in the discussion above, there were numbers like 1 million tps thrown around not too long ago, then the influence of scaling the L1 on the whole tps is even more miniscule. Scaling the L1 does not invalidate the layered scaling approach. In my view the only thing it does is it makes the L1 a feasible settlement layer for everything that is built on top. Without scaling the L1, the global settlement part of the Ethereum vision would not work out very well. \n\nPersonally, I do not really know if useful L3s will be a reality in a few years.

I would assume that publishing the proofs or state roots to the L1 is only a small fraction of the cost of running the whole infrastructure for an L3 so it might not really matter whether these proofs are published to the L1 or an L2. And even if the cost of publishing to the L1 are expensive they could just reduce the publishing frequency to the L1 and save some money there. Publishing directly to the L1 would also make their dependencies much easier (no L2 which has to be up for the L3 to work).
