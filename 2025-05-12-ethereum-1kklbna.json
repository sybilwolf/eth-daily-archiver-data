How do corporations monetize those today? I previously wrote about monetizing information retrieval. That brings us to the second thing AI is being used for: automation. To be clear, I'm not against automation. I'm about as [pro-tech](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-tide-of-technology/) as they come. I'm generally of the opinion that technology can't be suppressed, the adoption of useful technology is an inevitability, and the only viable path for our species long term is through technological advances. I want an AI to take my job; I just don't want to be crushed beneath the cruel boot of capitalism when it does. However, increasingly it looks like we'll be given little choice in the matter. As we adopt AI, we aren't just using it as an alternative to Google. We're feeding detailed task descriptions into them and expecting it to do the work for us. Artists are using AI to generate concept art at the earliest stages and to refine towards something they polish. Programmers are using AI to generate classes, simple functions, and comprehensive tests for software they write. Lawyers are using them to create draft arguments for courtrooms. I am already seeing many job listings that explicitly require you to use AI. Many more are implicitly requiring AI use to hit performance quotas. Our relationship with AI is increasingly becoming mandatory and it is learning from us with every use.\n\nAll of those detailed queries you are feeding into the AI are being written down and associated with your job description. Each time you submit a query, don't like the answer, and then submit a *refined* query you are telling the AI it didn't get it quite right the first time and what you really meant by the previous query. You are fine tuning it to understand the language of your occupation, what success at these tasks looks like, what success in your role looks like, and even how to manage your role. The Faustian bargain we are making with the tech oligarchs is they give us some free inference and we teach them how to do our jobs so they can package it up as an AI product. After Google has your job in a black box your job is gone and Google will retain all the remaining revenue from it in perpetuity. You either don't realize what you're giving up by using it or you aren't in a position where you have a choice even if you do.\n\nThe way this plays out isn't that suddenly an entire occupation vanishes. Rather, the AI starts with the simplest tasks and humans oversee the results at all times and serve as an error correction layer for the AI. Each corrected error is used to train the next generation so it can do those tasks without as much supervision and start to take on more complicated tasks. For example, if you want to automate truck driving you start on the simplest possible roads with a drive by wire system as a backup. Think 8 hour highway drives with few mountains and gentle weather conditions like the highway from Phoenix to LA. Maybe this automates 10% of the workforce and each driver on those system is overseeing 10 trucks at a time.  Each successive generation can drive in more difficult conditions. If you want to retain a job in the industry you either have to be contributing to the automation of that ecosystem or at the peak of skill where the AI can't do it yet. If you are seeing a tough job market in your field with fewer junior resources this process is going to catch up to you quickly. If you are at a company and think you are using AI for task automation, you aren't. You aren't using AI for automation, you are the one being automated. All the money of your occupation is going to flow to those who own the AIs.\n\nThe obvious answer here is to be the one who owns the AI. Now how do you do that today? Buy MSFT shares? That's a very diluted play and basically is the equivalent of telling you to first have $5M then you can live off it. Most AI plays are private equity at this point. You can't buy shares of Perplexity or Claude even if you wanted to. What you need is focused ownership over models that automate skills as that model becomes adopted and forces workers out of industries. The most approachable way to do that is to convert your own subject matter expertise into a model that you own and can monetize directly. DeAI is building the full tech stack to help you with that.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s a follow up on my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1joonxr/daily_general_discussion_april_01_2025/mkxmlgg/?context=3\">previous AI post</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, AI is being used for information retrieval and automation.
