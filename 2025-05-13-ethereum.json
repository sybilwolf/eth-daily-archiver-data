What does the world look like in 20 years once this has played out? I see three possibilities.\n\nThe first possible outcome is just an extension of what has already been happening for the last 50 years but rapidly accelerated by AI. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer - now accelerated by the force multiplier of AI. Imagine a world where there are two nations divided by a fence. The nation on one side of the fence has all the products of superintelligence. They have the most delicious food, addictive entertainment, desirable styles of fashion, and life extension technology granting effective immortality to whomever can afford it. On the other side of the fence is a nation without access to AI. Nothing the poorer nation makes can be better than their neighbor. The richer nation will presumably have superior versions of any replenishable commodity you can make today or will be able to make equivalents with little to no effort. Why wouldn't their meats be lab grown, their harvests be genetically enhanced, and the entire process be automated? No one has taken away the trees, livestock, or factories from the poorer nation but practically speaking there's nothing they have to trade except mineral rights.\n\nThe only thing of value the poorer nation can trade will be the literal earth and whatever minerals it may contain that can't otherwise be sourced from the air and water the richer nation has access to. If you, by lottery of birth, happen to be born to the poorer nation and don't own property with valuable mineral rights, you will just have nothing of value you can trade that you can make with your human brain and human hands. You are born onto a Monopoly board but every property is already taken and there is no passing Go for a free $200. No one you can hire in your nation has anything of value either. Over time people from the poorer nation with desperate need of the products of superintelligence are going to trade every bit of extractable value until there is nothing left to trade. Then that nation will basically be left homesteading; its' resources consumed.\n\nHowever, there needn't be a geographical fence. As long as property rights are enforced by the state, the divide is actually just between whomever owns the superintelligence and whomever does not. You can blend the geography however you like. From 1920 to 1980 the rich were divided from the poor by access to energy. From 1980 to 2025 they were divided by access to transistors. Going forward they will be divided by access to AI. This is the final divider, the final opportunity. After this there will no pathway in the endgame for anyone to emigrate from the proverbial poor nation. Wealth mobility = 0. Game over.\n\nIn this AI endgame whomever owns the AI will receive a roughly pro-rata share of whatever it produces. In a late stage capitalism outcome people are of no economic value. As with any other product of no economic value: they will be systemically destroyed by capitalism. Ironically, late stage capitalism eventually collapses into communism because everyone surviving owns the means of production and their share of it finances their lifestyle. This route leads to a reduction of the world population to something fewer than 1 billion.\n\nYou probably don't want to be amongst the 6B+ people being eradicated.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Next up in my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kklbna/daily_general_discussion_may_12_2025/mry7owy/\">deAI post series</a> I&#39;ll be talking about some future endgame states for humanity.
