Aztec is a privacy preserving L2. In some communication it is also described as a rollup. Not sure exactly if it is a rollup or not. The interesting thing is that Aztec encourages people to run their own nodes, sequencers and provers. They want to be decentralized from the start. The testnet start was accompanied with a lot of hype and some expectation of airdrops for early supports. Not sure if this is true though. \n\nThis hype lead to a massive jump in discord users and by looking at the questions many people tried to run a node for the first time ever. Nevertheless there are 3766 aztec nodes indexed at the moment. Which is pretty massive for a testnet. Most of the nodes (~60%) are in Germany and France. One of the cheapest server providers called 'contabo' has servers in France and Germany, that is why most of the nodes are located there. Most of the Aztec discord users seem to be from Asia. A not very reliable self declaration vote on discord resulted in Indonesia to the biggest group, but also India and Turkey came out pretty high. \n\nAs far as I have seen many people try to run the aztec node alone and use one of the many public RPC providers. This approach is not very reliable as the RPCs start blocking their requests and the aztec nodes they run fall behind. Some started paying for their RPC access but even then it seems to be a bit unreliable. Some other started to run their own sepolia nodes. Interesting to see how the aztec testnet helps that more people get the skillset to run nodes.\n\nFrom these 3766 nodes 320 are also sequencers (same as validators). Which means they publish blocks and attest to published blocks. Aztec had a preselected group of reliable community members which could start up sequencers before the official testnet start. All in all about 200 sequencers where there before the testnet officially started. For 2 weeks now, they allow 5 validators to be added through their smart contracts and they also add some people manually.  The idea is to stabilize the testnet in the beginning. On the first days they allowed many more people to join, but this destabilized the network until it went down. They had to issue a software upgrade and had to boot some of the newer validators again (me included).\n\nThese limited validator slots are very sought after and people are botting it and bidding up prices. Last week one could easily get in with a sub 1 sepolia ETH gas fee within the first few minutes of opening up the 5 slots. Yesterday, people were paying 120 to 205 sepolia ETH to get in and it all happens on the first block. As the sepolia faucets do not give your that much ETH all the winning bids have bought their Sepolia Ether through the layer zero testnet bridge. This means it cost them 20-40$ to get a validator. There were also many failing bids as well which also cost 5-20$ or so. It is gonna be interesting to see if we reach a plateau in the coming days or if people just start bidding higher. \n\nThere is also the prover market, but as I am not running a prover I have very little knowledge about it. \n\nOverall, the testnet is running pretty fine. There were 2 emergency upgrades in the first week, but since then it is pretty smooth sailing.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>About 2 weeks ago the Aztec testnet started. Aztec is a privacy preserving L2. In some communication it is also described as a rollup. Not sure exactly if it is a rollup or not. The interesting thing is that Aztec encourages people to run their own nodes, sequencers and provers. They want to be decentralized from the start. The testnet start was accompanied with a lot of hype and some expectation of airdrops for early supports. Not sure if this is true though. </p>\n\n<p>This hype lead to a massive jump in discord users and by looking at the questions many people tried to run a node for the first time ever. Nevertheless there are 3766 aztec nodes indexed at the moment. Which is pretty massive for a testnet. Most of the nodes (~60%) are in Germany and France. One of the cheapest server providers called &#39;contabo&#39; has servers in France and Germany, that is why most of the nodes are located there. Most of the Aztec discord users seem to be from Asia. A not very reliable self declaration vote on discord resulted in Indonesia to the biggest group, but also India and Turkey came out pretty high. </p>\n\n<p>As far as I have seen many people try to run the aztec node alone and use one of the many public RPC providers. This approach is not very reliable as the RPCs start blocking their requests and the aztec nodes they run fall behind. Some started paying for their RPC access but even then it seems to be a bit unreliable. Some other started to run their own sepolia nodes. Interesting to see how the aztec testnet helps that more people get the skillset to run nodes.</p>\n\n<p>From these 3766 nodes 320 are also sequencers (same as validators). Which means they publish blocks and attest to published blocks. Aztec had a preselected group of reliable community members which could start up sequencers before the official testnet start. All in all about 200 sequencers where there before the testnet officially started. For 2 weeks now, they allow 5 validators to be added through their smart contracts and they also add some people manually.  The idea is to stabilize the testnet in the beginning. On the first days they allowed many more people to join, but this destabilized the network until it went down. They had to issue a software upgrade and had to boot some of the newer validators again (me included).</p>\n\n<p>These limited validator slots are very sought after and people are botting it and bidding up prices. Last week one could easily get in with a sub 1 sepolia ETH gas fee within the first few minutes of opening up the 5 slots. Yesterday, people were paying 120 to 205 sepolia ETH to get in and it all happens on the first block. As the sepolia faucets do not give your that much ETH all the winning bids have bought their Sepolia Ether through the layer zero testnet bridge. This means it cost them 20-40$ to get a validator. There were also many failing bids as well which also cost 5-20$ or so. It is gonna be interesting to see if we reach a plateau in the coming days or if people just start bidding higher. </p>\n\n<p>There is also the prover market, but as I am not running a prover I have very little knowledge about it. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, the testnet is running pretty fine. There were 2 emergency upgrades in the first week, but since then it is pretty smooth sailing.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-05-15 00:10:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"msesday","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1kn0zzo","parent_id":"t3_1kn0zzo","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"> A not very reliable self declaration vote on discord resulted in Indonesia to the biggest group, but also India and Turkey came out pretty high.\n\nAirdrop farming hotspots.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>A not very reliable self declaration vote on discord resulted in Indonesia to the biggest group, but also India and Turkey came out pretty high.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Airdrop farming hotspots.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-05-15 15:35:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"msj3n0f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1kn0zzo","parent_id":"t1_msesday","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/etherchris","body":"Why don\u2019t we fight fire with fire.
