The increased blob space increased the lead a bit more. This shows that there is not a huge demand for alternative DA at the moment. In the long run I expect this to change again, but it is great to see that there is a clear demand for Ethereum native DA and that Ethereum can provide enough for the rollup space to grow.\n\nCurrently there are more blobs available than is demanded from the market. Not surprising when availability just doubled less than 2 weeks ago. This means blob prices are at the bottom (1 Wei) and essentially free. This is the same situation we had after the introduciton of blobs with the Dencun upgrade. It took a bit more than 6 months to consistently fill the available blobs and a fee market to develop. At the moment 3.5-4 blobs are filled out of the 6 available. I would expect it to also take a few months again for demand to match the available blobs and a fee market to develop. If you check etherscan you can see that blob carrying transactions still pay the normal gas fees though which costs them between 0.3-5$ depending on how much calldata they use with the transaction. So there is still some fees paid back to Ethereum.\n\nIn the long run we will most probably see a higher income from selling blobs alone. The demand is here which is a great indicator of things to come. There is also the discussion to include a fixed or dynamic minimum fee for blobs in the next upgrade (Fusaka) which would result in rollups having to pay a small amount even when there are many more blobs available than is demanded from the market. This is especially important as Fusaka comes with a massive increase of blob space. At the moment an increase by a factor of 8 is discussed, but it might be a bit smaller right after the upgrade and increased slowly afterwards. \n\nIf you want to have sources check out the dune dashboards which look at blobs. The hildobby one is always a great start. You already used growthepie.xyz which generally is very reliable. If you want to check the actual block carrying transactions and what they pay, go to Etherscan and click Blockchain->View Blobs and check the gas fees paid for some of the transactions.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What happened in the last few days/weeks is that Ethereum Blobs overtook alternative DA providers like Celestia in actual data posted.

At the moment 3.5-4 blobs are filled out of the 6 available. I would expect it to also take a few months again for demand to match the available blobs and a fee market to develop. If you check etherscan you can see that blob carrying transactions still pay the normal gas fees though which costs them between 0.3-5$ depending on how much calldata they use with the transaction. So there is still some fees paid back to Ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>In the long run we will most probably see a higher income from selling blobs alone. The demand is here which is a great indicator of things to come. There is also the discussion to include a fixed or dynamic minimum fee for blobs in the next upgrade (Fusaka) which would result in rollups having to pay a small amount even when there are many more blobs available than is demanded from the market. This is especially important as Fusaka comes with a massive increase of blob space. At the moment an increase by a factor of 8 is discussed, but it might be a bit smaller right after the upgrade and increased slowly afterwards. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to have sources check out the dune dashboards which look at blobs. The hildobby one is always a great start. You already used growthepie.xyz which generally is very reliable. If you want to check the actual block carrying transactions and what they pay, go to Etherscan and click Blockchain-&gt;View Blobs and check the gas fees paid for some of the transactions.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-05-18 18:47:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mszwlo1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1kpd36v","parent_id":"t1_mszfymd","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/sour_chili","body":"In the long run, cheaper blobs might mean less revenue for Ethereum right now, but they help solidify its role as the backbone of a growing L2 ecosystem.
