It's the Ethereum Foundation org chart. I know this has been discussed a lot in the past couple of months, mostly with a negative connotation, but I still wanna add some thoughts. \n\nAs you can see there are a lot of teams on the payroll. Some teams are in my opinion essential (e.g. the Geth team, Protocol Support, etc.) for Ethereum, especially when it comes to really implementing specs and basically running the protocol (obviously in the end the validators run the protocol, but client teams are as close as it gets). The research heavy teams have been questioned a lot though and I think it's fair to do that. It's not \"our\" money, but still the community and ecosystem should voice concerns if money is spent unwisely. Given that ETH had just a very few upgrades and a lot of the research done couldn't be implemented (just because the scope of every fork needs to be limited)... should all these teams exist? We could argue that the impact of a lot of teams was close to 0. \n\nWhen I was a Product Manager years ago, I wouldn't design new features if the roadmap was full. Deep in my heart I want things to be efficient. So why not cut the cost? \n\nWith Ethereum pivoting and likely increasing the amount of forks per year and hence the amount of features that make it into the protocol, the argument that all this research doesn't matter already weakens. At the same time there's one thing that is even more important. One killer feature can change everything. If R&D is successful and one of these teams creates something that only Ethereum has/ can do, then the impact of that is already so huge, that all the money invested in R&D that doesn't hit the chain isn't really relevant anymore. I believe now is the time to invest in research since we can expect the results of that process to be included in a fork soon. \n\nSo we shouldn't spend money just to spend money and distribute ETH from the foundation to others. But since the Foundation tries to align the implementation output with the research output and the bottleneck the investments make more sense than ever. Let's hope we see some younger EIPs make it into the protocol rather sooner than later!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have been thinking a bit about <a href=\"https://x.com/0xstark/status/1922642395654394082\">this tweet</a> (or <a href=\"https://warpcast.com/abcoathup/0xf8597ef8\">this cast</a> if you prefer Farcaster).

Deep in my heart I want things to be efficient. So why not cut the cost? </p>\n\n<p>With Ethereum pivoting and likely increasing the amount of forks per year and hence the amount of features that make it into the protocol, the argument that all this research doesn&#39;t matter already weakens. At the same time there&#39;s one thing that is even more important. One killer feature can change everything. If R&amp;D is successful and one of these teams creates something that only Ethereum has/ can do, then the impact of that is already so huge, that all the money invested in R&amp;D that doesn&#39;t hit the chain isn&#39;t really relevant anymore. I believe now is the time to invest in research since we can expect the results of that process to be included in a fork soon. </p>\n\n<p>So we shouldn&#39;t spend money just to spend money and distribute ETH from the foundation to others. But since the Foundation tries to align the implementation output with the research output and the bottleneck the investments make more sense than ever. Let&#39;s hope we see some younger EIPs make it into the protocol rather sooner than later!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-05-19 07:28:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mt33f2p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1kq4i2u","parent_id":"t3_1kq4i2u","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"I guess we are mostly speaking about the left side of the organizational chart.

If I would have to split something off, I personally think geth does not have to be an integral part of the EF anymore as there are now many flourishing client teams outside of the EF which ensure that there is a lot of client diversity. But I am also not sure how much the geth team really costs the EF as I would guess a large part of their salary is paid by the protocol guild (~70k$ of the total salary).
