If I interpret that first peak as general hesistancy while entering this new range, we might need another test of $560 or so before heading upward, to provide extra reassurance of support.  <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/TPgkOrl\">My very rough chart of pennant and zoomed out</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Definitely think failure and re-test of mid-low 400s is still possible, but feel like it&#39;s less likely -- I&#39;ve trimmed my trading stack to give a little fiat just in case.  If it does go down, I&#39;ll be underwater a bit, but a good buy down below should help make me feel better if I was wrong about the pennant &lt;shrug&gt;</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><em>edit</em>: Following up - a crazy volume profile indicator I like to use is showing some weakness at 510-530, which I&#39;d like to have seen resolved if we actually were going to break up; though it&#39;s also showing decent support at 440-480.   Which makes me think this is less a pennant, and more that we&#39;re going to be range-bound in the 500s for a while.   I don&#39;t like that, but it also doesn&#39;t sound right -- so just throwing my hands up and copying the call for \ud83c\udf7f  Maybe the market is so bullish, that&#39;s all the testing of 500s that we needed to do :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-14 07:43:45","distinguished":null,"edited":"2020-12-14 08:08:08","id":"gftj7ta","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kcrx35","parent_id":"t1_gftbjh5","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/sm3gh34d","body":"It does, but makes no sense given the macro situation.
