They aren&#39;t big names, just average joes that got started in crypto about the same time I did.  All of them are gone, and I&#39;m still here with no one to share my feelings with.  Silly but true.  I&#39;m actually a bit bummed about it. And this is not to downplay this sub or crypto twitter, but it just isnt the same as talking shop with someone else who is on the same page, in person. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I played around with Bitcoin back in 2013, found ETH in late 2015, and have generally mucked around in the space without a real concern about when I would cash out.  This year I finally made the decision to cash out at least partially when a certain threshold is hit.  I&#39;m a bit sad, I guess, that I&#39;ve finally committed to an end of sorts. I plan on holding a portion of my crypto holdings indefinitely - I&#39;d like to will them to my kids eventually.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>No real point to this post - just wanted to share :) Got thinking about this with the post from <a href=\"/u/ethlongmusk\">/u/ethlongmusk</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-17 11:34:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gg677fj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kerp5j","parent_id":"t3_kerp5j","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Throw in the towel on Eth?

Uniswap has $2B of liquidity. If ETH moves by 0.5% in the span of a block, there is $10 million of arbitrage opportunity there. At an average price of 400 gwei, a full block will include ~$3000 of fees. Without big changes in Uniswap v3, I suspect we could see gas price spikes in the thousands as volatility increases.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-17 10:47:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gg61beg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kerp5j","parent_id":"t1_gg5zit7","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SplinterCole","body":"Thats pretty dope actually, thx! \nI\u2019ll let the smart guys capture it and keep the liquidity deep, while i save my transactions until sundays :-)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thats pretty dope actually, thx! \nI\u2019ll let the smart guys capture it and keep the liquidity deep, while i save my transactions until sundays :-)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-17 11:30:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gg66pss","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kerp5j","parent_id":"t1_gg61beg","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/al-powell","body":"Some of you may have seen already but 0.2 ETH up for grabs in the Dai hard Christmas puzzle: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ke9fwk/dai\\_hard\\_a\\_christmas\\_challenge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ke9fwk/dai_hard_a_christmas_challenge/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some of you may have seen already but 0.2 ETH up for grabs in the Dai hard Christmas puzzle: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ke9fwk/dai_hard_a_christmas_challenge/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ke9fwk/dai_hard_a_christmas_challenge/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-17 12:13:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gg6c2ui","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kerp5j","parent_id":"t3_kerp5j","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-17 12:17:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gg6cl14","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kerp5j","parent_id":"t3_kerp5j","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/argbarman2","body":"Definitely meth singles nite","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Definitely meth singles nite</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-17 12:20:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gg6cxry","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kerp5j","parent_id":"t1_gg6cl14","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/FishyCatfish69","body":"Graph protocol mainnet and token launched today.

There is room for lots of different people to play a role within the network. Even if you just happen to know which dapps are up and coming on Ethereum, you can use that knowledge to be a curator on the network and profit.</p>\n\n<p>The protocol is applying a similar model to Ethereum whereby there is a foundation (The Graph Foundation) that is governed by The Graph Council (which I am on, a 6-of-10 multisig, representatives of the five main stakeholder groups in the protocol) and the long term aim is for the governance to dissolve into a system that can represent core interest groups more effectively, so moving towards a DAO model, perhaps. The near-term focus of the council is to take ownership of the smart contracts post-launch and to oversee grant and ecosystem funding.</p>\n\n<p>You can see all your fav dapp subgraphs in the explorer - <a href=\"https://thegraph.com/explorer/\">https://thegraph.com/explorer/</a> and if you want to read more about the governance, economics, or technical stuff there is a lot of great content on the blog - <a href=\"https://thegraph.com/blog/\">https://thegraph.com/blog/</a></p>\n\n<p>Finally if anyone is interested in getting involved in any of the roles in the ecosystem - indexer, curator, subgraph developer, delegator, all the action is happening in the discord - <a href=\"https://discord.gg/6Sg7xzgF3m\">https://discord.gg/6Sg7xzgF3m</a> you&#39;ll see me in the indexers chat, feel free to reach out (as long as its not about token price/purchasing)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-17 10:46:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gg617md","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kerp5j","parent_id":"t1_gg5vawl","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/TaxExempt","body":"Shit, had an opportunity to pre-ico them back in 2018.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Shit, had an opportunity to pre-ico them back in 2018.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2020-12-17 09:46:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gg5tnmq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kerp5j","parent_id":"t1_gg5qn8e","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/suclearnub","body":"I'm tempted to put some money into mirror.finance's mirrored US stocks... should I?
