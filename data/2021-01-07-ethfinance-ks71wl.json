So why did I do it then? Because while I am balls deep in crypto, I'm not irresponsibly so. I have crypto savings goals and I have old school savings goals. This is so that if I were to lose my crypto wallet or if ETH and BTC were to go to $0 tomorrow, no matter how unlikely, I am still on track to achieve my savings goals. I don't ever want to expose myself to the risk of not having any savings and having lost the last 4 years of saving to a black hole. So what I have done is set myself an annual minimum savings goal which I must meet each year, anything I save over that goes into crypto. This savings goal is enough for me to ensure that I can get on the property ladder before my 30s and hopefully own my own property outright by my 40s or 50s. I don't want that bare minimum financial dream of mine to be dependent on crypto. If crypto fails or I lose my wallet and I didn't put anything aside then I would be well on the way to forever renting and being a wage slave for the rest of my life. I can't let there be even a slight possibility of that even if it means I won't quite make the same sick gainz as I would otherwise this bull run.\n\n**You should also ask yourself the following:**\n\n>*Is my financial future entirely dependent on crypto?*\n\nIf the answer is yes then you are probably over-invested. Make sure you have a contingency plan so that you can still achieve some bare-minimum financial goals such as paying off debts by a certain date or owning your own property one day even if crypto fails. The only exception I would make to this is if you're working a low paying job, if you're quite old and have no savings/retirement plan or if you live in a country where such goals simply aren't possible by saving the old fashioned way. If any of these are you, having all of your eggs in the crypto basket is probably ok as any other methods of achieving your bare minimum financial goals aren't possible. Just be sure to do everything you can to reduce the risk of losing your crypto or getting scammed.\n\nFinally, you may think that ETH and/or BTC going up in price is a given long term or that crypto is too big to fail now. Well I would just about agree with you. However, please consider these two things:\n\n1. There are *many* and I mean *very many* ways for you to lose your crypto. ETH doesn't have to go to zero for you to lose everything if you get hacked because you left your crypto on an exchange or because you got phished. You could get sim swapped or you could copy/paste the wrong wallet address when transferring your funds. Someone could even put a gun to your head and rob you because you openly bragged about your 32 ETH. Hackers and scammers will always have new ways to catch you off guard. Don't ever let your guard down as nobody will come to your rescue once it is too late.\n\n2. When you spend all of your spare time learning about Ethereum, browsing r/ETHTrader, reading the r/EthFinance daily, browsing crypto twitter and watching crypto YouTube, you only ever see the bullish side. You're in an echo chamber. As a result, like me, you probably underestimate the risks which could see crypto lose value in the future. So while I personally find it super unlikely that crypto will go to $0 or fade into irrelevance (especially if you have a diversified portfolio and don't only hold assets on the Ethereum blockchain), it is important to reckognise your own limitations as a human being to be able to fairly asses the probabilities of different potential outcomes. I've spent nearly 4 years in this space and what scares me is not any particular threat wiping out crypto, but it is that everything seems so bullish and crypto adoption almost seems guaranteed that I worry that my own limitations to objectively assess the probabilities of different outcomes for crypto are why crypto seems like such a sure bet. Then one day, a black swan event will come and I'll wonder why the fuck I didn't see it coming.\n\n**Relevant Resources (old posts of mine):**\n\n*Most Relevant:* [Diversification and minimising risks](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gyas6u/diversification_is_multifaceted_what_i_have/)\n\nMy previous post on creating an exit strategy and managing risk: [Do YOU Have an Exit Strategy?

It seems that the likely scenario for global transaction settlements powered by blockchain is a bank backed stablecoin like J.P. Morgan Coin transacting on a private blockchain like Quorum. \n\nI don\u2019t know what this means for Ethereum and I\u2019m curious on your thoughts. On one hand, Quorum is an ethereum based private blockchain so this could be good for ethereum. On the other hand, these blockchains will be privately run by big banks. Will they be able to work with mainnet? Could these blockchains use ethereum mainnet as a bridge and interact with dapps or other private blockchains? If so that\u2019s likely very good for ethereum.
