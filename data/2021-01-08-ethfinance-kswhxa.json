I don't think there is much to be said that is relevant. IMO the wrench attack meme is indeed highly misleading. Here's my take:\n\nThe Ledger details are already released. But;\n\n1) There is no immediate way for an attacker to know whether those details are still valid (you could have moved, or never lived at the address in the first place);\n\n2) there is no immediate way for the attacker to know that *you* correspond to the leaked details (i.e. there could be multiple people at the address and they don't know what you look like);\n\n3) there is no plausible way for the attacker to know that you actually own a Ledger, either if you ever did, or you got rid of it;\n\n4) there is no plausible way for the attacker to know that you use the Ledger or hold any substantial crypto.\n\n5) Even if they can research all of the above and absolutely confirm you are a worthwhile target of value (which is a huge effort and virtually impossible because you could literally sell crpyto any time), they then have to plan the attack, which *certainly* involves the threat of violence, because they will necessarily have to interrogate you, in your home, to find the ledger and get you to execute a transaction while you all sit around like pals. *That is an extreme risk for a robber*. If it fails, or is successful but you're caught later, you're looking at serious prison time. Most robbers are not into actual violence. They pick known valuable targets and know *exactly* what they're going for up-front.\n\n6) It would much easier for an attacker to do research a local crypto meet-up, maybe even a conference. Should local crypto meet-ups be avoided? It's a fair bet that 90% of the attendees will hold cryptocurrency worth stealing.\n\nWith this in mind, if after all these risk considerations (and probably more that I have not considered), they decide to go ahead, what can the potential Ledger owner do to mitigate this? As far as I can see. About nothing. Why? Because, if a hardened attacker who is prepared to use violence against you has already decided to invade your home and interrogate you, it scarcely matters if your Ledger is secure. They're going to beat the sh!t out of you anyway until they can reasonable establish that you Ledger, or other crypto, is inaccessible.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>While I agree with you that there are risks, and that having a discussion is important, I think OP is spot on. I don&#39;t think there is much to be said that is relevant. IMO the wrench attack meme is indeed highly misleading. Here&#39;s my take:</p>\n\n<p>The Ledger details are already released. But;</p>\n\n<p>1) There is no immediate way for an attacker to know whether those details are still valid (you could have moved, or never lived at the address in the first place);</p>\n\n<p>2) there is no immediate way for the attacker to know that <em>you</em> correspond to the leaked details (i.e. there could be multiple people at the address and they don&#39;t know what you look like);</p>\n\n<p>3) there is no plausible way for the attacker to know that you actually own a Ledger, either if you ever did, or you got rid of it;</p>\n\n<p>4) there is no plausible way for the attacker to know that you use the Ledger or hold any substantial crypto.</p>\n\n<p>5) Even if they can research all of the above and absolutely confirm you are a worthwhile target of value (which is a huge effort and virtually impossible because you could literally sell crpyto any time), they then have to plan the attack, which <em>certainly</em> involves the threat of violence, because they will necessarily have to interrogate you, in your home, to find the ledger and get you to execute a transaction while you all sit around like pals. <em>That is an extreme risk for a robber</em>. If it fails, or is successful but you&#39;re caught later, you&#39;re looking at serious prison time. Most robbers are not into actual violence. They pick known valuable targets and know <em>exactly</em> what they&#39;re going for up-front.</p>\n\n<p>6) It would much easier for an attacker to do research a local crypto meet-up, maybe even a conference. Should local crypto meet-ups be avoided? It&#39;s a fair bet that 90% of the attendees will hold cryptocurrency worth stealing.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, if after all these risk considerations (and probably more that I have not considered), they decide to go ahead, what can the potential Ledger owner do to mitigate this? As far as I can see. About nothing. Why? Because, if a hardened attacker who is prepared to use violence against you has already decided to invade your home and interrogate you, it scarcely matters if your Ledger is secure. They&#39;re going to beat the sh!t out of you anyway until they can reasonable establish that you Ledger, or other crypto, is inaccessible.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-09 05:12:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ginhyao","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kswhxa","parent_id":"t1_gimoh50","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Whovillage","body":"I was casually dreaming of Flippening like a true Etherean the other day and something dawned on me - what really is flippening?   \n\n\nYes, it is Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in market cap.
