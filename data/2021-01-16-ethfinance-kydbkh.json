By that I just mean regardless of what anyone says about how great Bitcoin or ethereum is right now, there are risks. </p>\n\n<p>So take stock market. if you zoom out of SP500 chart since inception it looks like one long ass bull run for the last 100 years. That\u2019s pretty good proven historical track record. </p>\n\n<p>Not saying you should or shouldn\u2019t invest in one or the other but just zoom out and understand the risks of any investment you make and also your own tolerance for these risks. This is really key. </p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re young and have time on your side which is a great advantage. You have ability to allocate your risks and sit on them. In other words diversify. Many mkts are cyclical. One year asset A may outperform. Another year asset B. In a decade if you diversify properly you will likely do very well net.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-16 05:20:53","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-01-16 05:39:30","id":"gjge659","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_kydbkh","parent_id":"t1_gjgdc32","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jmart762","body":"Thanks for the input!
