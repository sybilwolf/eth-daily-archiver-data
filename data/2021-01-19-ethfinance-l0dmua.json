Also because there is only one way to so it. Meanwhile for Kraken staking you could either stake or buy with ETH/ETH2.S pair which trades at a discount. Now you would have two routes.\n\nMore simple discussion with wBTC and wETH. More fun with multiple layers like yCrvWSBTC (y vault, curve, wrapped, synthesix, BTC).\n\nEven more troublesome if you go over an aggregator and all the middle elements of the route would touch your FIFO tokens. Like eth->wETH->tBTC->token X. Thinking within one block they are uniquely distinguishable (only the others in a common pool are tracked FIFO) and should be no problem.\n\nMy approach, if the underlying thing is the same I mark it as taxless swap.\n\nStaking stETH and yCrvWSBTC is a bit more tricky. I think one would have to see the underlying token as taxless, but the earnings (exiting or eth2 launch) could be treated differently. At least if you sell them short term. If you keep them long term it's even more tricky, would do it with the FIFO thing though.\n\nLikely we know the answer in 10yrs \ud83d\ude48 but someone has to prepare a jurisdictal clearing approach.

Also because there is only one way to so it. Meanwhile for Kraken staking you could either stake or buy with ETH/ETH2.S pair which trades at a discount. Now you would have two routes.</p>\n\n<p>More simple discussion with wBTC and wETH. More fun with multiple layers like yCrvWSBTC (y vault, curve, wrapped, synthesix, BTC).</p>\n\n<p>Even more troublesome if you go over an aggregator and all the middle elements of the route would touch your FIFO tokens. Like eth-&gt;wETH-&gt;tBTC-&gt;token X. Thinking within one block they are uniquely distinguishable (only the others in a common pool are tracked FIFO) and should be no problem.</p>\n\n<p>My approach, if the underlying thing is the same I mark it as taxless swap.</p>\n\n<p>Staking stETH and yCrvWSBTC is a bit more tricky. I think one would have to see the underlying token as taxless, but the earnings (exiting or eth2 launch) could be treated differently. At least if you sell them short term. If you keep them long term it&#39;s even more tricky, would do it with the FIFO thing though.</p>\n\n<p>Likely we know the answer in 10yrs \ud83d\ude48 but someone has to prepare a jurisdictal clearing approach.
