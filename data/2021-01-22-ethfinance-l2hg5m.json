Might do it in the future but right now the interest I would earn on what I am comfortable minting up to (around 600 liq price if placed in stable coins) would be nice but not very impactful.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-22 13:08:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gk8mlt8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l2hg5m","parent_id":"t1_gk8ammx","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Y'all are the best for real.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Y&#39;all are the best for real.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-22 20:17:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gkak4w8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l2hg5m","parent_id":"t3_l2hg5m","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cantBelieveGotThis","body":"For real for real?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For real for real?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-22 21:59:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gkb0wrp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l2hg5m","parent_id":"t1_gkak4w8","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"The realest.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The realest.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-23 04:44:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gkcywnk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l2hg5m","parent_id":"t1_gkb0wrp","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Mkkoll","body":"Every time you are tempted to panic sell or swing-trade, remind yourself that ETH hasn't even started yet.\n\nBeaconchain 2.0 is in the oven and the devs are buidling every day. \n\nInstitutional investors are just starting to dip their toes in the water.

(Philosophy undergrad. Sue me.)  This might be another.\n\nLast Friday night, I decided to let go of some \"bags\".  These were not financial bags, but they were emotional bags.  I've stated this many times, but I started in crypto in 2014.  In 2014 and 2015, I didn't have much to invest, but over time I bought about 5 BTC and I had something like 4165 XMR.  Total invested was well under $10K.  My cost average on the XMR was well under $1. BTC was probably a $400 average.   \n\nYou can look at the charts, but crypto was sideways or down in 2014/2015.  Sometime early in 2016, I looked at this $7-8K and I thought, hell, I can do better in TradFi.  My stock market returns were 20+%.  I dumped all but one BTC and I sold 4000 XMR.  I meant to sell it all, but somehow I didn't.  \n\nA year later, shit had CHANGED in crypto.  Early 2017 was crazy.  Maybe around March or so, I jumped back in and started buying ETH and BTC.  As 2017 turned to 2018, I don't have to tell you what happened.  We had a blow-off top and a long bear market.  But...since 2014....I always had my XMR.  \n\nAt one point in time, XMR was worth $440 per.  The 4,000 I sodled would have been worth more than $1.6mm.  CLEARLY, I should have never sodled in 2016.  \n\nDid I learn a lesson?  Sure.  From the blow off top until, well, November 2020, I never sodled a fucking THING.  I told myself that my big mistake was selling in 2016.  This was true, but it was emotional baggage that followed me into 2020.  The XMR had outlived its usefulness in my portfolio. It ain't going to outperform ETH and a basket of DeFi.  I still believe in XMR as one of the few true \"currency\" cryptos.  It has its place.  But I let it go.\n\nThe difference is that I didn't sell it for USD.  I sodled for ETH and USDC to buy more ETH.  I guess it's fortunate for my state of mind that so far XMR is down from around $160 to $135 and I've picked up some ETH using USDC at lower prices than where ETH is right now.  \n\nThere will be hella capital gains tax to pay...virtually all that sale was profit...but not until April 2022.  In the meantime, I have increased my ETH hodlings and ventured into some more DeFi plays.  \n\nIt feels good.  It feels right.

BTC ain't exactly going anywhere, but DeFi is where all the action is heading.  And you can't have DeFi without ETH.\n\nThree years ago, when this was part of r/ethtrader, we tried to have a weekly altcoin thread for a while.  We also expanded the discussion to ETH and ERC-20's.  At that time, many people (including me, at times) would get a little salty when the discussion veered off of ETH into other assets.  There were forum darlings, notably OMG, and for a while NEO (Chinese ETH!) and QTUM and maybe FUN.

That being said what you are saying is laughable even at face value.\n\nDo you think market makers don't make money? They do. They can do this because they have sufficient liquidity to affect the market and the right data to not fight the market.

Obviously they are applying a model to data to decide when to buy and sell and making money at it to afford that real estate, that infrastructure, and the labor to maintain them.

That being said what you are saying is laughable even at face value.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think market makers don&#39;t make money? They do. They can do this because they have sufficient liquidity to affect the market and the right data to not fight the market. They have a sufficiently powerful model of the market to have a statistical edge and they apply that to be on the right side of a move more often than not. Their strategy is different than a small trader and it needs to be because of the AUM involved. They obviously aren&#39;t going to make their model public but it obviously works because they exist and have for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>There are high frequency trading bots that have made fortunes. Obviously they are applying a model to data to decide when to buy and sell and making money at it to afford that real estate, that infrastructure, and the labor to maintain them. What evidence do you need exactly that this is true? The floors of buildings nanoseconds away from the NYSE that are filled with computers? There&#39;s more than one ted talk on the topic, look it up.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a crypto project called Numeraire Signals predicated on the fact that you are wrong. It has paid out $40M in profit thus far. It&#39;s strategy changes frequently as it adapts to market conditions, but a changing strategy <em>is</em> its strategy.

It&#39;s just a matter of waiting for the bigger platforms (like Instagram) to integrate it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-22 05:35:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gk69lt8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l2hg5m","parent_id":"t1_gk66x3l","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/earthquakequestion","body":"Yeah I agree with most of what you're saying and maybe this comes down to a misunderstanding of what we're discussing on my part.\n\nI totally get the digital armor concept, or any skinned item in a game (or even more importantly the ability to sell/trade rare items that actually benefit players more than just customization), and I get the idea of ownership as it might pertain to a virtual world for example.

Closing below $33k (or really 32.9 on my lines) would be bearish ballgame for the near-term.</p>\n\n<p>For supports and possible bounce/entry points, I&#39;d defer to my previous comment which would still apply. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/l1sdgu/daily_general_discussion_january_21_2021/gk41ubn/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/l1sdgu/daily_general_discussion_january_21_2021/gk41ubn/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n\n<p>edit 15mins from close: TIMBERRRRRRRR</p>\n\n<p>edit for convenience: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here are some BTC-based targets to monitor as we go through a much-needed correction.  </p>\n\n<p>$30,000 - a big one, obviously, both psychological and the last local bottom  </p>\n\n<p>$29,200 - might be a place for a small bounce as it&#39;s the 100per12-Hour  </p>\n\n<p>$27,300 - the 10-Week MA  </p>\n\n<p>$24,000 - the 100-Day MA  </p>\n\n<p>$22,000 - the 20-Week MA -- hugely important as bouncing off this guarantees a renewed bull market and closing below it likely brings a new bear  </p>\n\n<p>Everything is determined by BTC in a crash.
