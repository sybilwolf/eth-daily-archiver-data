I have spent the last week trying to to engage with people in r/BitcoinMarkets in the same way that I used to\u2014engaging in discussion to try and move our joint understanding forward\u2014and they just don't seem very interested in doing that for some reason. So it genuinely feels fantastic to enter a brand new community and already have so many people taking the time to reach out; perhaps this really is where I belong now.\n\nAnyway, I can't get to sleep, so I'm going to go ahead and try to address u/i-love-the-pink-one concerns about higher timeframes. For tonight, I'm only going to look at a couple from the 1d and leave the rest for discussion in the morning. \n\nTwo things I would like to note, the first of which is, for the past few years *most* of my analysis work has been within the confines of BTC since I was mostly frequenting r/BitcoinMarkets, as I mentioned. So for some things, it may take me a bit to get caught up on specific intricacies. The second being\u2014don't get *too* caught up in indicators in the middle of ATH-breaking bull markets. While they're certainly by no means useless, more often than not a strong trend will trump what would normally be a strong signal.\n\nSo first let's look at the RSI. Yes, [while there is a bearish divergence](https://www.tradingview.com/x/g0Q9Hman/), if you look at the 12h I would argue that it already played out on the drop from $1400 => $1040. [Additionally, you have a hidden bullish divergence on the 12h as well.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kS2rzzyt/) \n\nSo the RSI and the over/undersold indicators really don't bother me much right now, especially since we have plenty of room/time to see where this move goes as it hopefully continues up, and if it does, you have a lot of upward space due to that hidden div.\n\nIn the same way, the MACD could, I suppose, be potentially problematic, but again, we're just coming off a strong pullback in which I personally believe that BTC was more influential than anything else. Those 3-4 days that precipitated that pullback were dictated by BTC's lack of momentum more than ETH's. While the second push after the ATH was certainly a bit weak, I really think we need to wait and see what happen over these next few days. If what played out tonight continues through, we'll likely see a lot of these indicators flip right back. \n\nYou also might be underestimating ETH's potential gains by simply judging it against its own history. I know that may sound a bit ridiculous, but look at the recent volume. If ETH is really going to start breaking from BTC a bit, which the analysis against the ratio seems to predict, then we may be looking at a very different asset over the next few weeks/months. [Consider BTC's historical indicators during these runs, for example.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3L71p85m/)\u2014logic is hardly of dire consequence.\n\nYou might think I'm being a bit overly optimistic here, and I'll admit that is certainly true, and in part, that's simply because I'm playing the positive side of your doubt on purpose. I'm not one to encourage empty optimism. So I'm looking forward to hearing more of your side tomorrow. \n\nAnd for the sake of a bit of skepticism before I run, let's say that we do take another dive here, and/or slow down a bit for awhile. This begs the question, if the ratio analysis seems so solid, are we really going to pull back here? And if so, is that going to crush the ratio formations?\u2014[Not necessarily, take a look at BTC's chart right now.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tt8egELn/)\n\nYou could see this one of two ways. The first as a consolidation/flag pattern, but the second way that I see it is, a little bear flag whose tail is struggling to get above the conversion line, and even further, a conversion line that's just crossed down. Now, admittedly, this is a pretty weak bearish cross, but a bearish one nonetheless. So it might not be ridiculous to see another drop to the \\~24k-27k zone, bouncing off the cloud, before regaining real momentum. \n\nAnd along with this, ETH has outperformed BTC for the last couple of weeks regardless. So sure, maybe you're right. Maybe we see ETH just consolidate a bit more while BTC does the same, only at a ratio that still drives us forward. \n\nAnyway, those are my thoughts. I think I probably yammered on a bit too long; so please forgive me as I'm much too tired to proof read this lol. Regardless, I hope that we can at least generate some interesting discussion around this tomorrow!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Okay, so first of all, I have to give a big shoutout to everyone for the upvote-welcome-party, as well as many of the comments.

The SEC literally won't let them sell the ETH at the moment for any reason other than that. This happens every day, even on those days where ETH is added it is still offset by this 200 ETH.

After the ETH CME goes live, major institutions will start shorting ETH and BTC to allow them to accumulate more of it at lower prices. This is still a lot of upward pressure, and if you ever see that upward pressure outweigh the downward pressure (which *will happen*) the short options hit their stop order buys. Meaning all of the shorts intended to keep the price low suddenly turn around and drive the price higher.\n\nNow is when we point out that the CME hitting an emergency stop *does not turn off crypto trading.* Wall Street's run home and cry in momma's lap option is gone. So, in desperation...Wall Street will call \"daddy,\" and by this I mean the Federal Reserve. And ask them to loan them something absurd like 20 quintillion dollars to put the mother of all short options on crypto so they don't lose their shirts.

After the ETH CME goes live, major institutions will start shorting ETH and BTC to allow them to accumulate more of it at lower prices.
