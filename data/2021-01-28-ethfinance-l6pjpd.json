A belief that this project would develop into something useful for the crypto space. The progress on Ethereum has blown all those initial expectations clean out of the water. We are doing things on digital wallets like Argent that I NEVER imagined possible. I am able to do whatever the fuck I want with my ETH, with the only detriment being gas prices.</p>\n\n<p>Most of you don\u2019t need to hear it, you\u2019ve been here through the years and you\u2019re not fucking selling. You\u2019ve watched as big name companies start taking a shine to Ethereum. You just witnessed a partnership formed with Reddit. You saw spez make little rocket ship emojis. Reddit is on board, and the world is on board with Reddit right now.</p>\n\n<p>To anyone concerned about why we aren\u2019t going parabolic right this moment, the answer is WE SHOULDN\u2019T! If we were being treated like a meme investment then that would be very bad. We should keep pursuing higher highs and higher lows. We should keep buying and holding, because that value has 20+ other ways to splinter off and create more value just by owning and using it.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulate those in GME and DOGE. Embrace and appreciate their success. Then realize what happens when people combine these beliefs and come to ETH.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-01-28 20:02:50","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-01-28 20:07:12","id":"gl6wqkp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_l6pjpd","parent_id":"t3_l6pjpd","score":36,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/neededafilter","body":"I feel DOGE pumping is just the WSB crowd memeing the entire crypto space as a joke, which it perceives it is.

I'm not so sure that that works for the GME-specific case. A synthetic market just tracks the oracle pricing of the tokenized asset; there's not an in-built market pressure from the tokenized asset to the real-world asset.\n\nIf traditional exchanges suspend retail access to a stock like GME, and retail goes to Kwenta or Mirror or Synthetix, and mints a bunch of tokenized GME, they can't arbitrage against the traditional markets, because they can't buy on the traditional markets.\n\nIf we want DeFi to be able to exert market pressure on traditional finance, we're going to need something else. Actors with access to both markets, who can arbitrage the differences, that's great, but the volume of the tokenized trading will be orders of magnitude smaller at first. To really make it work, you need a 1:1 redemption bridge, not unlike GBTC or ETHE. And how do we do that in a decentralized way?
