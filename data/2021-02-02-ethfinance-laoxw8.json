I'm reading up as much as I can, including all your helpful comments and insights, but I'll admit I'm far from getting my head wrapped around it properly! What I do take from it all though is that I can see how it can have huge potential in the future.\n\nMy intention was to invest in property but I've quickly come around to thinking a long term hold in Eth would be easier to manage. I can stomach the fluctuations and can hold for the long haul, so would be looking to stake. I'm not completely tech-stupid, but I'd be wary of staking on my own and would favour a solution with ease of use, so would something like CB staking (once launched) or RPL be the best bet? Considering Argent too, think I could about manage to figure that one out!\n\nI think I know the answer to this one, but when would be better to invest further?

I haven&#39;t been able to focus on trading because of my internship and my grandfather in hospital passing away. I&#39;m a little worried that if I make a trade back into ETH that it will drop. Is it worth the gamble? Everything is looking quite strong at these levels from a cursory glance, though RSI is looking quite high on multiple charts. The 12 hour and 1 day charts seem overheated to me, but volume has dropped. Should I wait for another dip below $1500 before placing a bit? I was thinking a limit buy just above the support, maybe $1400-$1430? I was right about the short term bearishness for the past couple of weeks, but wrong about the mid term upward trend.

Such airdrops can be based on anything: coins can be sent to every  wallet (an early practice) or wallets that had interacted with the smart contract in question in the past in one way or another, or whoever donated in some gitcoin donation rounds (either in general, or to certain projects). Since they are all individually tailored to what the project has in  mind, there is no formula for how to be entitled. Donating to useful cryptoprojects on  gitcoin and trying out the services of crypto projects that have not yet issued a governance coin cannot hurt, but there are no guarantees.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-02 20:19:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gltp1r6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_laoxw8","parent_id":"t1_gltme1h","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/negedgeClk","body":"The doodly is not nearly updooted enoughly.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The doodly is not nearly updooted enoughly.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-02 09:07:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"glr4ftm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_laoxw8","parent_id":"t3_laoxw8","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/readreed","body":"[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/AQdls6MQ-Ethereum-is-ready-to-go-4000-in-next-5-months/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/AQdls6MQ-Ethereum-is-ready-to-go-4000-in-next-5-months/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nvincemcmahon.gif","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/AQdls6MQ-Ethereum-is-ready-to-go-4000-in-next-5-months/\">https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/AQdls6MQ-Ethereum-is-ready-to-go-4000-in-next-5-months/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>vincemcmahon.gif</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-02 09:33:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"glr8kgh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_laoxw8","parent_id":"t3_laoxw8","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/five3x11","body":"It'll hit $10k minimum by the end of the year.
