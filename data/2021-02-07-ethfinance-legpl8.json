Assuming BTC remains where it is, ETH passing it in market cap would put it north of $6000.</p>\n\n<p>Eyeballing the charts, recent major pullbacks appear to be as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1350 to 900 (-33%)</p>\n\n<p>1420 to 1050 (-26%)</p>\n\n<p>1500 to 1200 (-20%)</p>\n\n<p>1450 to 1275 (-12%)</p>\n\n<p>Currently, we&#39;ve gone from 1760 to 1560 (-11%)</p>\n\n<p>It seems worse than it is because ETH is worth so much more now.  A 11% decline is a lot more money now than it was at any time last year.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, to really put things into perspective, I&#39;ve taken small profits starting at 1200 up to 1750. Had I not done anything at all, I&#39;d be up <em>considerably</em> more, despite the pullback over the past couple days.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re fine. We might decline a bit over the next couple days, but the bears are gonna get rekt in the end. I think, anyway.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-07 06:26:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gmfs0p6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_legpl8","parent_id":"t3_legpl8","score":76,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Phonethic","body":"So in case of another 33% dip from the recent top we can expect some support at 1150.
