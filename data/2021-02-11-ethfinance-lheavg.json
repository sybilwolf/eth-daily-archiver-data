The moment I internalized that this was for sure the way the future is going was in 2020. This may surprise some people, given that I\u2019ve been building in the DeFi space since 2014. But I was 90% confident for a very long time, and it wasn\u2019t until last year when I became 99.9% convinced that DeFi is the future of finance. I wanted to trade from one asset into another. I had one cryptocurrency that was a token on Ethereum. I needed dollars to send to an OTC desk to get me a cryptocurrency from an exchange that didn\u2019t trade in the US market. I used a decentralized exchange aggregator (a site that routes your order across dozens of decentralized token exchanges and gets you the best price) and traded that first token for USDC. The price I got was better than any OTC desk quoted me for the same trade. Ordinarily, I would've had to send it to a centralized exchange first, wait a while, trade it, and withdraw the USDC, which usually retakes a bit. Once I had the USDC, I sent the USDC to an OTC desk (at about 2 AM, when the banking system would\u2019ve been closed). The OTC desk bought me the new token and then sent it to my wallet for that blockchain a few hours later.  \n\n\nSo what just happened there is insanely cool. I\u2019d have to sell the initial position in traditional finance, withdraw dollars after waiting for settlement, and wait for the wire to process (so three days so far). Then the foreign OTC desk could buy me the asset I needed. And I\u2019d probably pay a fair amount of fees along the way too. And I certainly couldn\u2019t have done it at 2 AM because nothing would\u2019ve been open (neither my bank nor the market). Crypto markets trade 24/7.  \n\n\nJust the other night, I was getting indicative quotes on a 1000 ETH trade, and decentralized exchange aggregators offered lower slippage than Coinbase Prime. This feels like a watershed moment for the DeFi space. Not only is it a better system in theory, but it is also actually starting to become more useful to crypto users than other centralized systems. Companies like Coinbase will always help onboarding users to crypto from fiat/USD. Still, for crypto to crypto and stable coins <> crypto, DEXes will begin to dominate. Ethereum is the asset at the forefront of all of this. Even after its recent run-up, it still trades at a P/S ratio of 40x, which will become earnings for ETH stakers when value switches to Ethereum 2.0. Revenue on Ethereum has grown over 400x since January 2020. It\u2019s an insanely cheap asset compared to anything else in the public markets with that kind of growth relative to its revenue multiple. It\u2019s not entirely crazy to see Ethereum being able to 5-10x from here, especially when compared to traditional equities markets. Ethereum is the base layer of this new open financial system. The vast majority of the value in that system is transacting on top of smart contracts written on Ethereum. The net present value of the global settlement layer's transaction fees for all of finance is a considerable number. We have positioned the Pantera Liquid Token Fund around the opportunities surrounding decentralized finance and the Ethereum ecosystem for all the reasons above. \n\n The fund was up 98% in January versus BTC up 15%. We think that similar to the last cycle, Bitcoin dominance (BTC\u2019s percent of overall market cap in the space) will eventually go down into the forties again. In our view, the primary beneficiaries are likely to be Ethereum and Ethereum based decentralized finance assets, as well as eventually DeFi assets on other chains like Polkadot later in the year. This outperformance so far has mainly been due to our positioning surrounding DeFi (and some due to catching an opportune time to take some risk off after BTC hit $40k).

But if the UMA project TVL increases to various targets, the same option will give you more - up to 20 UMA per option - so it massively incentivizes adding to UMA&#39;s TVL. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4\">https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-11 06:43:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gmxx8j2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lheavg","parent_id":"t3_lheavg","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/accountaccumulator","body":"Sweet!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sweet!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-11 06:47:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gmxxrm8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lheavg","parent_id":"t1_gmxx8j2","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/SplinterCole","body":"This is so fricken awesome.
