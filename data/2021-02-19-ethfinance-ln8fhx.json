Disabling image content by default is a great way to avoid accidental opens! It\u2019s hard to tell scam vs legit based on SL and preheader seen from inbox.

We send a lott more emails out to those who actively open sends; Inactive users are emailed a lot less often - each send costs .0000x cents, so the cost/benefit isn\u2019t appealing enough to justify high volume for those records. \n\nWill say though, we do not pull your IP from a simple open. Our data related to IP relies on your interactions on the main site - like if you created an account on the site (with the email address) or just clicked through the email and redirected to site.

And you\u2019re absolutely correct, engagement is huge in general.

A png token is worth \\~$15 usd now and a 400 uni balance will have got you around 80 tokens.\n\n**Step 2:** go to [https://aeb.xyz/#/transfer](https://aeb.xyz/#/transfer) which the avalanche Ethereum bridge.\n\n**Step 3:** You need to send 1 uni or sushi across the bridge in order to activate your claim. Even if you have no more uni/sushi in the wallet, you can still claim by buying uni/sushi on uniswap, for example,  and sending it across the bridge.\n\n**Step 4:** Tick the \u201cI want to send funds to my address\u201d box so that the uni/sushi crosses the bridge into the same address controlled by your metamask/ledger but on the avalanche network. Not ticking this box will mean you\n\n**Step 5:** Set your gas fee and send the transaction. Use either the standard or slow gas fee depending on your time preference from [https://www.gasnow.org](https://www.gasnow.org/). If you are really patient, set it to 80 or 90 gwei and hope it goes in over the weekend.\n\n**Step 6:** When the bridge deposit clears, you now have an asset on the avax network, but you don\u2019t have any avax to pay transaction fees, so you need to get some. Go to coingeko ([https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche)), scroll to the bottom and find an exchange to buy some avax. Most people have binance and understandably don\u2019t want to use it right now, so your other options are bitfinex or okex. 0.4 avax will be plenty to do all the transactions you need but I\u2019d recommend 0.2 as a minimum.\n\n**Step 7:** Because avalanche has multiple chains, you cannot just send straight from an exchange to the chain which your png is on. The EVM equivalent exchange is the C-chain (where your PNG airdrop resides) so you must first create a wallet ([https://wallet.avax.network/](https://wallet.avax.network/)).\n\n**Step 8:** Backup your seedphrase however you like but take into account that this is only a wallet you will be using for a short time, so speed might be of more importance than ultimate security (I took a picture of the seedphrase with my phone, but this is not recommended for a wallet that will hold funds for quite some time).\n\n**Step 9:** save your wallet to your browser (so that you don\u2019t have to restore from a seedphrase each time) by going to the \u201cmanage keys\u201d section, selecting \u201cexport key\u201d and entering a password.\n\n**Step 10:** get your x-chain address from within your wallet and withdraw from the exchange to that address.\n\n**Step 11:** do a cross-chain transfer from the X chain to the C chain.\n\n**Step 12:** Send some avax from your C-chain wallet to your Ethereum address on avalanche. You now have avax in your wallet and you can finally claim your png. But first, you need to access your airdrop wallet on avalanche\u2026\n\n**Step 13:** To do that, set up your metamask to work with the avalanche network. See this link for more details: [https://pangolin.exchange/tutorials/getting-started](https://pangolin.exchange/tutorials/getting-started)\n\n**Step 14:** Finally\u2026.claim your png token.\n\n**Step 15:** swap your png token for avax (or hold, which ever you prefer). Also don't forget to swap your uni/sushi token to avax so you don't lose it!\n\nNow here is the trick to this, the bridge fee to get back to Ethereum is really expensive (>$500) so we are going to get around that by transferring to a centralised exchange via the wallet that you created in step 7.\n\n**Step 16:** So send your avax to your C-chain address on your avax wallet\n\n**Step 17:** Cross-chain transfer your avax from C-chain to x-chain\n\n**Step 18:** Send from X-chain to exchange address\n\n**Step 19:** Sell on exchange for some glorious free eth\n\nNote: I had an issue with metamask on the avalanche network where the claim button just wouldn\u2019t work.

I\u2019m sure my new funds will be back on ethereum when the fees have calmed down.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-19 09:34:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"go1027c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ln8fhx","parent_id":"t3_ln8fhx","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"this is a good approach. i think it makes you think harder about where to park capital for an extended investment horizon","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>this is a good approach. i think it makes you think harder about where to park capital for an extended investment horizon</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-19 09:40:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"go10vv5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ln8fhx","parent_id":"t1_go1027c","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/ab111292","body":"hahaha Elon changed his profile pic on Twitter to laser eyes meme trend BTCers have been doing:\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1362863263982247940?s=20](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1362863263982247940?s=20)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>hahaha Elon changed his profile pic on Twitter to laser eyes meme trend BTCers have been doing:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1362863263982247940?s=20\">https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1362863263982247940?s=20</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-19 12:38:22","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-02-19 12:42:52","id":"go1orok","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ln8fhx","parent_id":"t3_ln8fhx","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptrd285","body":"Full send to 100k confirmed lol","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Full send to 100k confirmed lol</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-19 12:43:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"go1phhs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ln8fhx","parent_id":"t1_go1orok","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/richardsaganIII","body":"does anyone know if these miners that are so up in arms about EIP1559 have contributed their huge earnings over the last year back into the community for public development and improvement of ethereum itself?\n\ndid they contribute to any gitcoin grant rounds? etc\n\njust curious at the moment if anyone has come across talks or discussions around this -groups could be anonymous about giving back but i would imagine if they have motives for the benefit of the system and are not just after more fees than they've been getting the last year, there would be a public show of giving some of those earnings back to improve the platform that is making them so much money.. just a thought i had.. not really important i guess.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>does anyone know if these miners that are so up in arms about EIP1559 have contributed their huge earnings over the last year back into the community for public development and improvement of ethereum itself?</p>\n\n<p>did they contribute to any gitcoin grant rounds? etc</p>\n\n<p>just curious at the moment if anyone has come across talks or discussions around this -groups could be anonymous about giving back but i would imagine if they have motives for the benefit of the system and are not just after more fees than they&#39;ve been getting the last year, there would be a public show of giving some of those earnings back to improve the platform that is making them so much money.. just a thought i had.. not really important i guess.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-19 15:00:05","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-02-19 15:20:19","id":"go24tuw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ln8fhx","parent_id":"t3_ln8fhx","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"I'd really be interested to see how many grants those miners have contributed.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;d really be interested to see how many grants those miners have contributed.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-02-19 15:01:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"go250rq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ln8fhx","parent_id":"t1_go24tuw","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/DasChemist","body":"Slim to none, coming from someone who used to run a couple rigs.
