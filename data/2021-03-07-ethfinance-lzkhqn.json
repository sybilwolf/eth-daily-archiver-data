Known as EIP 1559, the change solves a current problem: Ethereum users can only estimate how much Ether will be needed for transactions to be processed, a guessing game that has spawned sites such as ETH Gas Station to help people know how much to pay. EIP 1559, which will become part of an upgrade in July or August, will embed an average price into the network itself making the guessing game obsolete.\n\n\nThe reduced supply of Ether will likely lead to rising prices as demand for the coins increases, said Eric Turner, director of research at Messari, a cryptocurrency analytics firm.\n\n\n\u201cThis is probably one of the biggest milestones we\u2019ve seen recently,\u201d he said.

Ether has risen about 560% in the past year, while Bitcoin is up about 430%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Unlike Ether, Bitcoin has had since its start in 2009 a fixed supply of 21 million coins that will ever be created.

From my understanding after reading <a href=\"https://medium.com/big-data-protocol/big-data-protocol-the-defi-protocol-powering-a-liquid-marketplace-for-commercially-valuable-data-f299ca4c7eb5\">this article on their medium page</a>, they wrap their data sets and you can purchase the data using their token. Why wouldn&#39;t you just purchase the data directly from them using dollars or another currency? Why do they need their own currency? And what does burning the token when you redeem it for data actually achieve?  </p>\n\n<p>I was looking through their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigdataprotocol/status/1368437207283994624?s=20\">Twitter</a>\nand saw they were promoting 450% APY for staking in their pools, as well as using typical moonboi language like aping in, etc. A few red flags for me, given they apparently have over $6 billion TVL in just a couple of days. Any thoughts?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-07 16:01:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gq5mmgg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lzkhqn","parent_id":"t3_lzkhqn","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/RobertLobLaw2","body":"Nothing grows this fast organically.
