The moral argument demands the opposite. </p>\n\n<p><em>(For instance, even if he is in Coinbase&#39;s highest pricing tier \n(<a href=\"https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees\">$500m+</a>) there is still a taker fee of 0.04% which would amount to a $1,000 fee (if the NFT sells at it&#39;s current price of $2.5 million.))</em></p>\n\n<p>So either he is ignorant of this fact (which, if he has looked at their website, is impossible) or he is posturing for the BTC community (and his personal bags), which, if you look at his twitter over the past few years, is par for the course.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-09 09:50:39","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-03-09 09:58:06","id":"gqcqcv3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m106rq","parent_id":"t3_m106rq","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethlongmusk","body":"This isn't charity, it's marketing.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This isn&#39;t charity, it&#39;s marketing.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-09 09:51:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gqcqj57","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m106rq","parent_id":"t1_gqcqcv3","score":25,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/horolome","body":"Philanthropy (I\u2019m talking ultra wealthy) is mostly big dick swinging but with positive externalities.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Philanthropy (I\u2019m talking ultra wealthy) is mostly big dick swinging but with positive externalities.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-09 11:05:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gqd00lt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m106rq","parent_id":"t1_gqcqj57","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/sandworm87","body":"He probably means he'll send the equivalent amount from his own BTC holdings and hang onto the ETH so can have a giant bag of ETH for staking.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>He probably means he&#39;ll send the equivalent amount from his own BTC holdings and hang onto the ETH so can have a giant bag of ETH for staking.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-09 10:06:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gqcskbj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m106rq","parent_id":"t1_gqcqcv3","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"He seems to be knowledgeable enough to know he doesn\u2019t need to do this.

The Labs team have delivered an exclusive game where players can compete with others to place on the leaderboard in a paydrop styled game. </p>\n\n<p>Even better, this game runs 24/7, costing less than $1 a day to run. </p>\n\n<p>We will show this to the community this Thursday, at 5pm GMT with a live stream held via our lockdown lounge. </p>\n\n<p>This crucial first step in understanding what is viable via xDai has taught us a lot during this research and build phase. Of course, we won&#39;t stop there as we investigate more blockchain opportunities via different solutions to understand the features associated with each.</p>\n\n<p>This process will help us guide how we can improve the casino, and which is the best solution while observing the Ethereum network updates.&quot;</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-09 08:31:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gqcejv1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m106rq","parent_id":"t3_m106rq","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Pasttuesday","body":"Maybe you can message him about matic.

So if any ETHFV nodes are forwarding txns back to ETH nodes, unwinding your CDP there could unwind it on ETH as well!  \n\nTo work around this, you'll need to never issue an ETHFV txn without doing one of two things:  1) before each ETHFV txn, have the same nonce already confirmed on ETH with a 1559-style transaction; or 2) at the start after the fork, relocate ALL holdings on the ETH side to a separate address, using 1559-style txns -- after which it'll be safe to broadcast ETHFV txns as much as you want.\n\n**Cost/Benefit**\n\nFinal question though, is the effort of (3) and (4) going to be worth it?  Per (2) there needs to not only be enough counterparty interest, but enough evidence of it *beforehand* that it's worth it to some devs to make a bridge.

Of course, I have my opinion on the right answer. </p>\n\n<p>Right now, EIP-1559 has all the support sans miners... for reasons you stated. That&#39;s what it is, they are playing the game. But on the other hand, users are playing that game too. Miners can fork the network. Users can take their ball (fees &amp; userbase) and go somewhere else. The last big one was BTC/BCH, which brought out a lot of bad in people. We&#39;ll see, the beauty of watching this type of governance unfold. </p>\n\n<p>But in short, I think both sides are exerting their power. Idk if that&#39;s &#39;hostile&#39;, or at least if it is BOTH are being hostile. Idk... to much theory and ideology at that point! (Again, notably ignoring those 5% fringies who are straight up threatening each other or whateveR)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-09 12:53:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gqdeigp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m106rq","parent_id":"t1_gqdch33","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haijink","body":"I think I wasn\u2019t too far off in my original understanding of the issue but you and some other commenters filled in some details I hadn\u2019t considered.

Immediately after the peak (like 1-2 days later) would be the crash.  Initially the crash will look like just another correction that you need to hold through, the problem is just *just keeps going*.  So if the peak was in Oct, by Dec it would probably be down by half or more, then by Feb another half, then another half, then another half, and so on, until a year has gone by and you're sitting at 10% of the peak value.\n\nFor price targets, I have 3.  $5k is my \"high probability\" value, if it doesn't go at least that high I'll be very surprised.  $10k is my \"expected\" value, I expect the peak around there, but if it doesn't quite hit it I won't be shocked.  $20k is my \"hopeful\" value.  It *could* get that high, but I don't think it's very likely.  I've therefore planned my sell points around the $5k, $10k, and $15k ranges. \n When it gets near each of those values I'll be watching things like Glassnode's NUPL charts to estimate local peaks and staging out accordingly.\n\nOf course that's all assuming those price targets correlate with the date ranges listed above.  If we're hitting $10k by May I might need to re-think my whole \"ignore all volatility through July\" mantra, and similarly if we're getting to October and still hovering around $4k I'll need to re-think those sell points or the timeline as well.  So far this bull market has been much faster than the previous one, I'm not sure if that means we should be expecting a very early peak and crash, or a long drawn-out correction period through the summer like what happened to Bitcoin in 2013 (hit $230 in April, then pulled back through the entire summer/fall and didn't get back up to $230 again until November 4, then quickly rose up and peaked at $1100 3 weeks later).\n\nIt might be worth keeping an eye on the Bitcoin rainbow chart as well:\n\nhttps://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/\n\nOr I could be wrong about all of this and it does something completely different.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>My post was covering the peak.

So if the peak was in Oct, by Dec it would probably be down by half or more, then by Feb another half, then another half, then another half, and so on, until a year has gone by and you&#39;re sitting at 10% of the peak value.</p>\n\n<p>For price targets, I have 3.  $5k is my &quot;high probability&quot; value, if it doesn&#39;t go at least that high I&#39;ll be very surprised.  $10k is my &quot;expected&quot; value, I expect the peak around there, but if it doesn&#39;t quite hit it I won&#39;t be shocked.  $20k is my &quot;hopeful&quot; value.  It <em>could</em> get that high, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very likely.  I&#39;ve therefore planned my sell points around the $5k, $10k, and $15k ranges. \n When it gets near each of those values I&#39;ll be watching things like Glassnode&#39;s NUPL charts to estimate local peaks and staging out accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Of course that&#39;s all assuming those price targets correlate with the date ranges listed above.  If we&#39;re hitting $10k by May I might need to re-think my whole &quot;ignore all volatility through July&quot; mantra, and similarly if we&#39;re getting to October and still hovering around $4k I&#39;ll need to re-think those sell points or the timeline as well.  So far this bull market has been much faster than the previous one, I&#39;m not sure if that means we should be expecting a very early peak and crash, or a long drawn-out correction period through the summer like what happened to Bitcoin in 2013 (hit $230 in April, then pulled back through the entire summer/fall and didn&#39;t get back up to $230 again until November 4, then quickly rose up and peaked at $1100 3 weeks later).</p>\n\n<p>It might be worth keeping an eye on the Bitcoin rainbow chart as well:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/\">https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/</a></p>\n\n<p>Or I could be wrong about all of this and it does something completely different.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-09 16:30:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gqe5m5z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m106rq","parent_id":"t1_gqe17ys","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Thank you for this excellent analysis!
