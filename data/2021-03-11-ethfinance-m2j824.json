The team\u2019s star player and Team Captain, is a gentlemen named Roy Kent. But the problem is Roy is starting to lose a step to younger players, like Jamie Tartt and Dani Rojas. Because of these younger players, Roy started to become insecure, often times lashing out at Coach Lasso and throwing hissy fits. Ted was put into a tough spot, do you keep playing your Team Captain, or do you grow a pair and tell l him he needs to take a seat? (Spoiler alert) When Ted finally benched Roy, wow was he upset. It took him a while to get over it, but later on he proudly accepted his role on the second team, and the team was stronger because of it. One of the best moments inside the locker room was when Roy put on his practice jersey with pride, and led his team out for a practice after handing over his \u201cC\u201d.

It will probably take 10 years to recover from with different security methods, but the whole cryptosphere will be so tarnished that few will want to touch it. Not to mention that you would not want to be in the shoes of heads of the mining pools that caused it, as they will have so many people after them for what they have done. And this will be on any level of reasonble losses suffered by people effected. Sometimes I think that people involved in crypto can become detached from reality when they can cause harm to others. If they are seen to do it on purpose the ramifications are immense for them even if it only initially conserns ethereum.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-03-11 06:07:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gqknpuo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m2j824","parent_id":"t3_m2j824","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Heringsalat100","body":"Trying to compromise the network you are mining for in that way is like nuking planet earth because of dying rainforests.
