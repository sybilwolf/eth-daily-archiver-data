So instead of 100 TH splitting 10 each to 10 random coins, it might be like 50 of it just goes to Nice Hash and the rest of the 50 is split out to coins.

I don&#39;t believe there is a definitive second place GPU coin that would consistently be head and shoulders above the rest to pledge your miner to long term. So instead of 100 TH splitting 10 each to 10 random coins, it might be like 50 of it just goes to Nice Hash and the rest of the 50 is split out to coins.
