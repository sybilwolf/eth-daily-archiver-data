I&#39;d love to read an actual line by line rebuttal of PoS (steel man instead of straw man e.g. responding to one of Vitalik&#39;s blog posts), but rather all I see is weird energy worship with no actual arguments beyond what could be covered by researching PoS for 5 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>The points about PoS not being decentralized are rich as well when he spends half the article explaining that all of Bitcoin&#39;s hashpower is run by massive corporations located in China (but a few are moving out of China!). Somehow though, Proof of Stake is political power in the hands of the rich, even though a large % of this sub can profitably run individual nodes in their living rooms. But hey, why stake in a decentralized network and earn yield from your home when you can just give your Bitcoin to BlockFi and get the same return.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-03 16:47:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gtaohwy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mj1sdm","parent_id":"t3_mj1sdm","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SwagtimusPrime","body":"Bitcoin maxismalists are caught in the old ways.
