How much is sold is up to those who own the ETHE (think miners - they have the newly minted supply but don't have to sell) but for the sake of science let's assume it's a pretty consistent flow of sell pressure, maybe 65% to 85% just sell no matter what... doesn't really matter.\n\nSo we are currently entering the period where what was created in Q4 of 2020 is coming available to the secondary market. Which is notable for two reasons:\n\n1. Q4 2020 was the biggest quarter of issuance for Grayscale. From 10/1/2020 to 12/31/2020 -  66,904,200 ETHE shares were issued (674,786 ETH) and 167,883,900 GBTC shares were issued (157,272 BTC). Not only the biggest, but just a huge amount in general ($1.3 Billion of ETH and  $8.8 Billion of BTC at todays prices).\n2. By the time Q1 2021 came around, the premium imploded shortly later and issuance basically ceased. Both by market forces and Grayscale temporarily closing the fund a little earlier then usual - ETHE especially with the big January pause in the fund. From 1/1/2021 to 3/31/2021 -  24,889,100 ETHE shares were issued (236,633 ETH) and 53,463,500 BTC shares where issued (47,564 BTC). That is about 1/3rd of Q4 2020.\n\nThe premium I'm of the opinion is pretty much a function of supply vs demand. Which brings up a pretty interesting *potential* alignment of the stars haven't really seen since December. Based on supply coming to market, we could see the next 3 months continue to be pretty tame regarding the premium as all these shares are coming into the secondary markets. Either being consistently sold or at least ready to be sold if the premium grows.\n\nBut once that is done, there will be a lot less coming to market Q3 of 2021 (Q1 2021's issued shares). Which now means Q3 gets really interesting because that is when EIP-1559 will come out. If EIP-1559 gives us the boost the ETH price we all think we could see the demand for ETHE should increase as well. Possibly creating a prefect storm where secondary market ETHE goes through it's own \"halvening / cliffening\" of sorts (supply side) while demand rises because ETH / Crypto goes on a general tear this summer. Maybe just enough to get us one last little fun run at obnoxious premiums before an ETF comes to market?\n\nThoughts? Obviously it's just that... a theory (sorry to pull a Chico Crypto here...). One based on a big what if on ETH price this summer and no ETF being announced in the next 6 months. It's something I probably won't even act on other then to monitor going forward... but is a possible YOLO bet to throw a few bones at worth it here / DCA the next few months? u/dashby1 \\- tagging as you are always following this closely.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have a working theory on the ETHE premium I&#39;d be curious on some input from people on.</p>\n\n<p>Determining secondary market ETHE issuance is just taking how much ETHE was created 6 months ago and applying it to today.
