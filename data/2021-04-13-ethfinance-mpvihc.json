Just like how PE had illiquidity/debt/operational risk, DeFi has its own unique risks like smart contracts, oracle&#39;s etc. I think what&#39;s interesting is to separate the systemic risk from the idiosyncratic risk. If you farm stablecoins across different protocols, you reduce drastically most of the risks you mention above (not too sure if they all rely on the same oracle&#39;s tho tbh)</p>\n\n<p>Either way I&#39;m really excited about DeFi as a new asset class. P2P lending (aave, compound) not too much, as it&#39;s nothing new, but AMMs and LPs are an entirely new asset class, which in the future, imo, could possibly sit beside other yield bearing instruments like dividend stocks, FI, REITs, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Exciting times! I agree that Eth is a once-in-half-a-lifetime? opportunity regardless. Actual use cases with DeFi has only made me more bullish on it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: formatting</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-13 08:03:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gudlsln","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mpvihc","parent_id":"t1_gudiojx","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-13 08:08:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gudmg9x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mpvihc","parent_id":"t1_gudlsln","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Birds_canfly","body":"Hopefully uniswap's new oracles can supplant binance.\n\nI swear everyday new protocols just pop up.

Anyone chime in on this? Is he correct?\n\n **...Current Plans and Why It's Great:**\n\n While Reddit has been working on this for years, this implementation is nothing but a huge deal. It changes a lot of things:\n\n 1. **Eth Users**: This onboards 311M new users to having their own Ethereum wallet and learning how to user Ethereum.\n\n 2. **Eth Usage**: To claim or send your tokens uses Ethereum. There is no way that this can't increase the demand for Eth substantially.\n\n 3. **Rewarded Content**: You now earn tokens for posting good content that gets engaged with. The largest content site in the world is going to pay you for engaging with their audience.\n\n 4. **Investment in Small Communities**: It now makes finding and building new communities more important, as it is easier to earn a share of their token at that time.\n \n 5. **Remove Ad Dependence**: Reddit's ads are dumb. This better aligns Reddit's monetization with users.\n \n 6. **New Reddit Features**: There is a ton of new stuff rolling out to use the community points on. Some I know about, and plenty I've not yet seen. Either way it is great to see new features and it creates a dynamic rewards economy.\n\n 7. **Tipping In Every Sub**: Previously to have tipping a in a sub, you had to trust a sketchy third-party tipbot and be able to agree on a currency to support. Now each sub will have native content.\n\n This is huge for Reddit, and MASSIVE for Ethereum.\n\n It's been in the works for YEARS because it takes time to get it right.\n\n This will possibly be the largest crypto adoption driver we will ever see from one single source. [[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/g0dbc4/daily_general_discussion_april_13_2020/fna3a29/)]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n* u/concernedcustomer33: Global uncertainty is at levels few living people have ever experienced. I expect the economic news to get far worse before it gets better. It's unrealistic to expect the everything bubble to reinflate soon; I see an analog of the early 1930 bounce in the stock market, progressing more quickly, but on a familiar course. I already sold most of my equities, and I don't have the fortitude to hold a significant BTC position right now.\n\n That said, I'm not selling my ETH. With much higher prices quite possible in less than a year, I want my potential tax burden as small as possible. I remain convinced of Ethereum's objective superiority compared to every other crypto project, and continue to view the ratio as primed for massive gains. With eth2 launching this summer, the narrative in the crypto market will change. I already see the initial signs; don't say I didn't warn you.

Anyone chime in on this? Is he correct?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>...Current Plans and Why It&#39;s Great:</strong></p>\n\n<p>While Reddit has been working on this for years, this implementation is nothing but a huge deal. It changes a lot of things:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Eth Users</strong>: This onboards 311M new users to having their own Ethereum wallet and learning how to user Ethereum.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Eth Usage</strong>: To claim or send your tokens uses Ethereum. There is no way that this can&#39;t increase the demand for Eth substantially.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Rewarded Content</strong>: You now earn tokens for posting good content that gets engaged with. The largest content site in the world is going to pay you for engaging with their audience.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Investment in Small Communities</strong>: It now makes finding and building new communities more important, as it is easier to earn a share of their token at that time.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Remove Ad Dependence</strong>: Reddit&#39;s ads are dumb. This better aligns Reddit&#39;s monetization with users.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>New Reddit Features</strong>: There is a ton of new stuff rolling out to use the community points on. Some I know about, and plenty I&#39;ve not yet seen. Either way it is great to see new features and it creates a dynamic rewards economy.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Tipping In Every Sub</strong>: Previously to have tipping a in a sub, you had to trust a sketchy third-party tipbot and be able to agree on a currency to support. Now each sub will have native content.</p>\n\n<p>This is huge for Reddit, and MASSIVE for Ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s been in the works for YEARS because it takes time to get it right.</p>\n\n<p>This will possibly be the largest crypto adoption driver we will ever see from one single source. [<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/g0dbc4/daily_general_discussion_april_13_2020/fna3a29/\">1</a>]</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"/u/concernedcustomer33\">u/concernedcustomer33</a>: Global uncertainty is at levels few living people have ever experienced. I expect the economic news to get far worse before it gets better. It&#39;s unrealistic to expect the everything bubble to reinflate soon; I see an analog of the early 1930 bounce in the stock market, progressing more quickly, but on a familiar course. I already sold most of my equities, and I don&#39;t have the fortitude to hold a significant BTC position right now.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I&#39;m not selling my ETH. With much higher prices quite possible in less than a year, I want my potential tax burden as small as possible. I remain convinced of Ethereum&#39;s objective superiority compared to every other crypto project, and continue to view the ratio as primed for massive gains.

(which just started recently) The ETH earned in the presale goes to a redemption pool contract. BND can be burned to spin the gacha machine on Polygon's L2 to dispense an NFT of varying rarity from a limited set. Each NFT is entitled to a portion of the ETH in the redemption pool, with the higher rarity NFTs being worth a larger percentage. You can choose at any time to burn your NFT to redeem ETH in the pool, but the caveat is that every time an NFT is burned 10% of the ETH reserved to that NFT remains in the pool, which boosts the redeemable value of every other NFT that has not yet been redeemed. This one is particularly interesting to me because you could play the NFT angle or the BND angle. On the NFT side there's the game theory of should you redeem or sell on the secondary market? Questions like when people will decide to redeem, and at what rarities, in addition to the question of how many get sold in secondary markets (where each each NFT should have a safe floor value based on its redeemable value, with potential upside based on future redemptions). There's also the BND play, where after the sale the token supply is capped, so the token becomes hyper deflationary, and may have value sort of like a 1st gen unopened pokemon card pack. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are probably some others like these, but that's what I mean.
