Truly there is nothing differentiating under the hood; I looked.\n\nSo with that out of the way let\u2019s have a look at their PE. From a tokenomics perspective [95% of the fees collected](https://medium.com/vesperfinance/understanding-vvsp-the-vsp-pool-39bd0cbf249f) go to VSP holders and the rate is currently 303.41% per year. That\u2019s quite an APR! So am I interested?

Honestly 182M in profit for a coin worth 108M is pretty damn good. Now anything under PE 20 is usually fair game for me except for that usual before debasement term.\n\nSo let\u2019s have a look at that debasement and how fragile that number is.\n\n[Here\u2019s the basic issuance schedule](https://docs.vesper.finance/vsp-economics/supply-dynamics). Over the next 10-ish months the VSP supply is going from 2.668M to 10M. If the market cap were to hold that\u2019s a debasement cost of 7.332M * 40.42 = 296,347,799. Yup that\u2019s about 114M more in debasement cost than ecosystem profit. So the actual PE after debasement cost is infinite. And that\u2019s just the start of the problem.\n\nThe VSP issuance is a good deal for LP\u2019s and therefore by definition is not so good a deal for vVSP holders. People are flocking to the pools for the 40% APR. Most of that APR is paid in VSP. As the issuance causes sell pressure rates fall and the rates normalize to closer to 20% there is nothing to distinguish Vesper from its more mature and innovative competitors. The LP\u2019s are liquidity locusts who will move on and take all their ecosystem profit with it. It's a system that needs someone to buy about $100M worth of VSP this year to sustain its market cap. Don't be one of those guys. Basically this ecosystem has no path forward without extreme inflation because it has no distinguishing features on the technical end. \n\nFurthermore, once the vsp/eth pools stop getting incentivized there\u2019s no reason those LP\u2019s shouldn\u2019t migrate to a vVSP/ETH pool and dilute the rewards which would drop the APR in half yet again.\n\nTLDR: If you\u2019re farming VSP as an LP, great.

If Ethereum can do 10,000+ TPS on rollups or PoS sidechains, who needs a L1 running DPoS for multichain? I'd argue moving funds to a rollup isn't only just as \"bad\" as bridging them to a different L1, it's actually better. As we all know rollups inherit Ethereum's full security, while DPoS chains do not. And even if you want an ultra-performant solution you can just build your rollup in such a way - eg the zkSync team and their design of splitting it into a zk rollup and a zk porter side - zk rollup fully secure, zk porter a little less secure but it scales high enough for literally any usecase.\n\nI have also not heard a single thing about eg Polkadot's scalability plans. How much TPS can they do on a parachain? A couple thousand? That's not enough for mass adoption. How do you put a L2 on top of a Parachain and then make that compatible with all other parachains etc?

There's centralized exchanges in there but I expect more solo-stakers by the time withdrawals are enabled. The staking pool thing has the consequence that most pools are hosted in data centers because you need massive storage and hardware requirements to handle all that load. So Ethereum: thousands of retail-stakers all over the globe, running validators in their own home. Other chains: dozens of pools in data centers. Which one is more censorship resistant? It's obvious.
