Could this be the top? I'm skeptical. We didn't suffer through a brutal bear market just to go to 1.8x ATH.\n\nThere still remains so much on the horizon this year.

I feel like this cycle I&#39;m less likely to panic after a drop because at least I can continue to keep earning interest/rewards on my coins through a bear market, which I can then use to actually pay for real world things and slightly improve my quality of life, instead of just hoping someone will buy them at a higher price at some probable future date that is totally out of my hands. Of course, if all of crypto collapses for some reason (huge hack/outright ban), then the staking/interest regime will collapse but I don&#39;t see that as likely.</p>\n\n<p>But then again it seems like the other coins you can stake/earn interest on are still subject to as much volatility as they were before.

How far is the question...$1920 had really strong support, and is close to the 40 day moving average.  </p>\n\n<p>But that wouldnt be much of a dip and again it would be whether or not a sub-40k bitcoin could see us hold that support (my pessimistic side says no).  </p>\n\n<p>The next strong support is 1700 as a ~38% retracement from the 52 week ATH.  50% retracement would put us at near 1400 (and close to 2017 ATHs).  </p>\n\n<p>Trade safe out there. I still think we see $3600 by June. This is just a bump in the road.
