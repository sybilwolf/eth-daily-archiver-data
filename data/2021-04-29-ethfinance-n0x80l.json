That\u2019s 50x today\u2019s fees, or 20x the best ever day\u2019s fees of $50M on Feb 23. I think we\u2019ll hit 50x total fees within five years.\u201c\n\nHe then went on to say:\n\n\u201cETH at $100k is an ~$11T market cap, which is 5.5x Apple. Yet, Apple\u2019s revenue is already more than $1b per day. How can ethereum be worth 5.5x Apple if ethereum makes less revenue than Apple? It\u2019s because ethereum\u2019s profit margin is 99%+ due to proof of stake being almost free.\u201c\n\nOn March 1, Berckmans made the interesting\u00a0observation\u00a0that \u201cEthereum\u2019s fees are worth ETH at $2850.\u201d He then said that the reason for Ethereum price currently being below the value of the cash it generates is that \u201cEthereum\u2019s fees go entirely to miners, who are on track to be paid 8% of all ETH this year.\u201d\n\nHe then added that EIP-1559 and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will \u201cfix this\u201d:\n\n\u201cEIP-1559 redirects ~35% of miner revenue to ETH holders by burning a portion of fees. Note that this fee redirection is secure because Ethereum has temporarily overpaid for security. Last year, we paid miners $300M+ more than if EIP-1559 had been live.\u201c\u201cSwitching to proof of stake redirects ~100% of miner revenue to ETH holders. That\u2019s because proof of stake validators are so cheap that they\u2019re effectively free compared to proof of work miners. Yesterday, proof of stake would have saved ~$30M for ETH holders.\u201c\u201cEIP-1559 likely launches in July with the \u2018London\u2019 hard fork. Next year, Ethereum switches to proof of stake. Ethereum may produce $20b+ in cash for ETH holders during our first year using proof of stake.\u201d\n\nOf course, as one Twitter user (@iamDCinvestor) correctly\u00a0pointed out, it is possible that \u201cL2s increase tx density by more than 50x and they pay 50x vs today on L1 for security.\"","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>On Saturday (March 27), Ethereum engineering and strategy consultant\u00a0Ryan Berckmans\u00a0explained\u00a0hw the price of Etheruem (ETH) could reach $100,000 within the next five years.</p>\n\n<p>Berckmans, formerly a Senior Engineer at\u00a0Augur,\u00a0explained\u00a0why $100k is a realistic price target:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEthereum\u2019s total fees need to be $1b per day for ETH to be worth $100k from fees alone (using a 3% discount rate). That\u2019s 50x today\u2019s fees, or 20x the best ever day\u2019s fees of $50M on Feb 23. I think we\u2019ll hit 50x total fees within five years.\u201c</p>\n\n<p>He then went on to say:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cETH at $100k is an ~$11T market cap, which is 5.5x Apple. Yet, Apple\u2019s revenue is already more than $1b per day. How can ethereum be worth 5.5x Apple if ethereum makes less revenue than Apple? It\u2019s because ethereum\u2019s profit margin is 99%+ due to proof of stake being almost free.\u201c</p>\n\n<p>On March 1, Berckmans made the interesting\u00a0observation\u00a0that \u201cEthereum\u2019s fees are worth ETH at $2850.\u201d He then said that the reason for Ethereum price currently being below the value of the cash it generates is that \u201cEthereum\u2019s fees go entirely to miners, who are on track to be paid 8% of all ETH this year.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He then added that EIP-1559 and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will \u201cfix this\u201d:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEIP-1559 redirects ~35% of miner revenue to ETH holders by burning a portion of fees. Note that this fee redirection is secure because Ethereum has temporarily overpaid for security. Last year, we paid miners $300M+ more than if EIP-1559 had been live.\u201c\u201cSwitching to proof of stake redirects ~100% of miner revenue to ETH holders. That\u2019s because proof of stake validators are so cheap that they\u2019re effectively free compared to proof of work miners. Yesterday, proof of stake would have saved ~$30M for ETH holders.\u201c\u201cEIP-1559 likely launches in July with the \u2018London\u2019 hard fork. Next year, Ethereum switches to proof of stake.
