This is ok!  I/we all felt the same way when we got into previous cycles late or at the peak.  I know I did, it\u2019s human nature.</p>\n\n<p>The key is \u201ctime\u201d.  Have patience and you will be rewarded no matter your entry point.  Most here are truly unable to understand how this technology will change mankind but the people here, right now are the future gatekeepers of the next financial system and beyond ie election voting, real estate, commerce healthcare to name a few.</p>\n\n<p>This community is incredible!  For 3 years I never posted and only lurked (ethtrader) and learned before I felt confident to contribute in a \u201cmeaningful\u201d way.  Now I feel I could teach a college course and am able to talk literally for hours straight about the subject.  I\u2019m happily married, 2 kids, work in IT for a fortune 100 tech company and NO one in my circle professionally or socially is into crypto in any meaningful way - let alone understand blockchain or crypto in general.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure to dollar cost average and take full advantage of bear markets.  Bear markets are incredibly tough for newbies and even for young vets but these are the real opportunities to capitalize on!  Be careful trading and remember to factor in taxes. Many forget this piece of the equation and it\u2019s a mofo!  Literally just cut a check to the IRS for what I could have bought a brand new BMW for\u2026 all due to trading which was NOT worth it in the end by a long shot!  I\u2019m still learning lessons too lol!</p>\n\n<p>WE ARE STILL SO F\u2019ING EARLY!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-30 21:03:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gwi9fxt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n1mqd1","parent_id":"t3_n1mqd1","score":51,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Good post.

Let&#39;s face it, the organizational structure (or governance, if you like) around Ethereum development is pretty loose. Folks come and go, opinions rise and fall, yet somehow progress - slowly - is made, even in the face of super hard technical, game-theoretic, and organizational/operational challenges</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s astounding that it works at all, yet here we are. I&#39;m thinking there are two primary reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Vitalik</li>\n<li>The crowd-sale/pre-mine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The former needs no further comment. The latter - well, you still come across people who decry the pre-mine as a black mark on Ethereum&#39;s legitimacy, but I&#39;m thinking that somehow they managed to correctly <em>align incentives</em> for early adopters, team members and devs to drive progress through dark times to get to where we are today. Many of those devs either were awarded or earned enough ETH to have real skin in the game, and I imagine those who held on to even 10% of their early holdings are doing just fine. Good for them, and good for us. You can&#39;t rely on altruism alone to get through difficult times.</p>\n\n<p>Go devs. We love you.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-30 09:03:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gwftmeg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n1mqd1","parent_id":"t1_gwfm8q7","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/BakedEnt","body":"I can totally see why he went that way with how the communication went from 2018-2020","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I can totally see why he went that way with how the communication went from 2018-2020</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-30 08:37:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gwfpud0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n1mqd1","parent_id":"t1_gwfm8q7","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/BuyETHorDAI","body":"I sold all of my Bitcoin in 2016 and never looked back.

Smart like everyone here, who saw the value and importance and potential of ethereum before it became ubiquitous and mainstream. Smart for recognizing eth\u2019s power to disrupt finance and become a worldwide settlement and smart contract layer for just about everything. </p>\n\n<p>As I said, I think it\u2019s still early. The future is bright and I\u2019m confident everyone here will also hit their moon or Mars price if you have patience and diligence while we wait for the world to realize the power and capabilities of eth as it delivers on its roadmap. </p>\n\n<p>Hodler since 2015 and I\u2019ll still be around for staking and to see where the tech takes us. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m going to quit my job and buy a house on the beach and live my life however I please. I made it. And I know you will make it too. </p>\n\n<p>Cheers to the best internet community with the best users and best mods, intelligent minds and a diverse set of personalities. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next for the ethereum ecosystem, I\u2019ll be here along for the ride with you all. </p>\n\n<p>Fortune favors the bold, keep dreaming friends.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-04-30 05:15:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gwf0pcb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n1mqd1","parent_id":"t3_n1mqd1","score":118,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethlongmusk","body":"Congratulations!
