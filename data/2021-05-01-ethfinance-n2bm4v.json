What we need to do, is convince them that Ethereum is the winning platform, without shitting on what they already believe in. People tend to double down when you tell them that they are wrong.\n\nI think it might be better to acknowledge that Cardano might end up being great. The team working on it are quite experienced, and the product they eventually deliver possibly will be the \"best thing since Ethereum\". The problem is, that it's just going to be too late. Ethereum DeFi ecosystem is growing at a dizzying rate. And BSC has already hoovered up the \"low fee\" crowd who want to play around with DeFi and experiment. There is no place in the market for Cardano, even if it is great.\n\nJust like Windows Phone. A great mobile operating system. But hopelessly late to market, and with no apps.\n\nIn my view, the smart contract platform war is going to boil down to \"decentralised\" vs \"centralised\". And Ethereum and BSC are now the main established players in that war. Cardano is in this weird middle space between the two. There isn't a gap in the market for something that isn't really much of anything.

Ethereum is excellent as a general solution for everything. However, not every business is capable of integrating ethereum into their business without substantial investment in internal developer teams/IT infrastructure. That opens up productive niches. LTO for example can construct a bespoke solution for a large legal firm then other legal firms being in the same industry can adopt the same solution. All of a sudden you have industry standards. </p>\n\n<p>Like I said it\u2019s not an ethereum competitor but I really like how they are distinguishing themselves rather than trying to compete. I believe there is value in what they are doing. Not top 20 market cap value but it\u2019s a good project that I believe will still be around and getting used in a decade.

Even if you could sell earned ETH to help cover the costs, you\u2019d be looking at capital gains tax on top, reducing your staking interest to the point where you\u2019re making about 1/10th the original amount, and that\u2019s being generous with favorable tax rates in certain jurisdictions.</del></p>\n\n<p><del>I think a lot of people have an overly rosy and, frankly, delusional view of living off staking income. If you\u2019re not already incredibly wealthy, with cash-on-hand, it\u2019s not gonna happen in the US.</del></p>\n\n<p><del>Edit: the assumes the price of ETH remains constant, which we all know it won\u2019t, but it can\u2019t go up forever, year over year, hence the risk.</del></p>\n\n<p><del>Edit 2: I knew I\u2019d get downvoted because it\u2019s not what you want to hear, but it\u2019s true. You\u2019re going to have a very bad time come next tax season if you don\u2019t think ahead and plan.</del></p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: ok, so I wasn\u2019t aware one could sell the earned ETH immediately for 0 capital gains, or its cost-basis when you sell later. That does make the system viable.</p>\n\n<p>Really appreciate you guys setting me on the right path.
