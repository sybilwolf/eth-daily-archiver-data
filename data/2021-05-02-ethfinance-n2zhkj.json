The price has risen a lot, the volume has been strong, still no fee vote but there are fees baked into v3 from the start and I still expect the UNI voters to turn on the fee switch on v2 at some time.\n\nSo let\u2019s start with a review of YTD volume. Data from info.uniswap.org\n\nWeek Of|Volume in Billions|\n:--|:--|\n1/3|6.06\n1/10|5.79\n1/17|5.95\n1/24|6.17\n1/31|7.17\n2/7|7.46\n2/14|8.11\n2/21|8.44\n2/28|6.44\n3/7|7.86\n3/14|7.31\n3/21|7.77\n3/28|9.72\n4/4|8.42\n4/11|8.72\n4/18|11.18\n4/25|8.41\nTotal|130.98\n\nThis is data from 17 weeks, so we get an annual volume projection for UniV2 of 400.64B. Now, there is no protocol revenue on these fees yet but I\u2019ll price in assuming the voters will eventually turn on the 0.05% fee. This would give us an annual protocol revenue of 200M.\n\nMarket cap: 22,095,038,303\n\nPE assuming current volume levels: 110.475191515\n\nFor me to buy UNI at this price I\u2019d want to see protocol revenue around 1.1B which is >5x what we see right now.\n\nSo we\u2019re definitely at speculative levels compared to my January post when the PE was 23 and I was buying just because the price has gone up so much compared to volume. People are clearly pricing in Uniswap v3 and that\u2019s expected because it\u2019s literally days away. So let\u2019s have a brief review of the [changes in v3](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/).\n\nTo start with LP\u2019s will be able to condense their liquidity range when they join a pool. It\u2019s like if a limit order was a curve instead of discrete. This will allow you to jam in all your DAI to buy alUSD in the 0.99 to 1 range. The condensed liquidity range for LP\u2019s is clearly a shot at Curve\u2019s market share. In general I can respect that the capital efficiency of uniswap v3 with its condensed liquidity ranges for LP\u2019s will capture market share of volume, especially among Dex\u2019s where aggregators like 1inch and Matcha just send people to whatever gives them the best price with very little loyalty to any given protocol. However, I don\u2019t think capital efficiency on LP\u2019s generates *new* volume. Just by market share there isn\u2019t enough volume for Uniswap to steal in the Dex space to 5x.\n\nNext Uniswap is launching soon on the OVM, which is an L2 solution. Unlike the capital efficiency part above, I could actually see the lower gas fees generating new volume, especially if they can get OVM withdrawals from Cex's which would enable near atomic arbitrage between Cex's and Uniswap v3 on the OVM. It's hard to put a number on that at the moment so I won't. Instead I'll just say maybe they'll steal all the Loopring volume.\n\nNext there are different fee tiers. This again will allow a better product market fit for different assets such as like-kind assets (shot fired at Curve again) and exotic assets (here\u2019s to you Chad farmers). IMO Uniswap was already winning on the exotic asset front and Curve only does about \u00bc of Uniswap v2\u2019s volume.\n\nLastly Uniswap v3 introduces protocol fees by default at 10% or 25% of LP fees. This is compared to the Uniswap v2 fee switch of 16%. Best case scenario for PE would be that Uniswap v3 cannibalizes Uniswap v2 volume, basically destroys Curve, eats Loopring volume on L2, and then turns on a 25% fee switch for nearly everything. Looking at the volume numbers of all of the above that still doesn\u2019t bring us down to PE 20.\n\nSo, while I support everything Uniswap is doing, and I haven\u2019t sold any since $20, I\u2019m also not in DCA mode for Uniswap until I see the volume numbers outperform my expectations. This would primarily come just from more volume (especially with rising asset prices) and capturing market share from Cex\u2019s.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the silver!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>With the upcoming Uniswap v3 launch I thought it would be a good time to review UNI PE.

There are a few things that I think are also worth pondering, in addition to your analysis. \n\nFirst, an important question to ask when trying to evaluate a token like UNI is: how much value should we assign to the role of governance and the amount of capital governance has at its disposal? (Relevant: Placeholder VC partner Joel Monegro also recently postulated an interesting idea on the [Bankless podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paU21vir0gQ&t=1300s), that *governance is capital.*)\n\nThe Uniswap Governance Treasury, which is owned and controlled by all UNI holders (the public, team, investors and advisors), [is worth over $17 billion](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1387889555299254278), ~$4.5 billion of which has [already been vested](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc#tokentxns). That ~$4.5 billion represents at least 20% of Uniswap's market cap today, and looking at Coingecko, I am almost certain they are including that UNI in the circulating supply number.  \n\nSecond, Uniswap is of course still in it's early days, and like you mentioned, is receiving some major upgrades in the coming weeks. There's going to be an [order of magnitude](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1380217938867843072) increase in efficiency that is coming with v3 (which will also allow for a *maximum* capital efficiency of [4,000x when compared to v2](https://youtu.be/Ehm-OYBmlPM?t=455)) combined with a L2 launch on Optimism. These upgrades could allow Uniswap to devour even more of the DEX market share (it's currently at [35% market share](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/dex-non-custodial/share-of-dex-volume-monthly), when including BSC platforms, and 60% when only accounting for Ethereum DEXes). \n\nI personally think v3 will be the final nail in the coffin for most competing DEXes and those protocols will pivot to other product-market fits (Sushi is already expanding its menu in this way) and we could see Uniswap gobbling up 90% or more market share by the end of this year. Gateways to Ethereum like Dharma and MetaMask, among others, are already introducing their users to Uniswap as *the* place to exchange tokens and with the enormous capital efficiencies in v3, liquidity will increase to such a point that aggregators like Matcha and 1inch will be routing almost every trade through Uniswap.\n\nI think Uniswap (UNI) as a protocol is still heavily undervalued *and*, at the same time, I think 99% of all assets in the world are going to underperform ETH this year and it's very likely UNI is among them. Still, I love Uniswap, the UNI token and owning a piece of one of the most interesting blockchain projects out there. It's an exciting protocol with so much room for growth and I am optimistic Uniswap will cross some jaw-dropping milestones later this year (the first $10 billion day and the first $100 billion weekly). \n\nThe total addressable market of Uniswap is the entire Ethereum ecosystem plus every traditional marketplace that will be tokenized on Ethereum - upwards of hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets.

I have the exact opposite problem as most of you guys and would like to contribute to a retirement account to diversify. Looking for a loan of \\~$6000 that I plan to pay back this summer when I get a job.\n\nMy choices are to use DeFi (MakerDAO, Aave, Compound, etc.) or a centralized service.\n\nMakerDAO charges 3.5% interest at a liquidation ratio of 175%, Aave charges a 3.9% interest rate, and Compound charges 6%. So I'm assuming that if I plan on using a really high collateralization ratio, I should use the 3.5% interest rate CDP from Maker.\n\nOn the CeFi side I could use Blockfi which charges 4.5% and Celsius which only charges 0.75% somehow (for a 6 month loan at 400% collateralization). The rate for Celsius seems a bit too low to be true so I'm wondering if they are a reputable company.\n\nAnyone have any experience with getting a loan? I am also pretty worried about taxes because I heard using some DeFi apps might cause taxable events (like I heard depositing ETH into yearn might be considered a swap from ETH -> yETH, and I'm wondering if it's the same for aTokens or cTokens).  \n\n\nEdit: Looks like I should open a Maker CDP. So my questions are: can I pay back the loan partially (like maybe 3k one month and 3k the next month) and also if I'm using the 175% liquidation ratio option, how much collateral should I put up to be safe from a 75% drop?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What&#39;s the best place to get a loan with ETH as collateral?
