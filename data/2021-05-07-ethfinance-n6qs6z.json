I need time for proof-of-stake to cement itself, for there to be no problems with it, for everything to be ironed out, for everyone with those $10-25 thousand price targets to have either sold or decided to stay. </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a world where we just see a complete collapse, like a full-cycle downturn. If by the end of Q1 2022, if we&#39;re back at $2,000 because it went up to $20,000 and it fell 90% or something, that&#39;s a lot of overhead supply so it might be tough to get all the way back up to $150k. Could we get back up to $30,000 to $50,000 on base case? I still think we can, especially if an ETF comes in and I still think the illiquidity applies, but those real peak heights, it&#39;s going to depend a lot on how many people sell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-07 12:04:59","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-05-07 16:28:23","id":"gxb1ll7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n6qs6z","parent_id":"t3_n6qs6z","score":27,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I mean Jesus.

Ideally money provides a reliable store of value, a stable unit of account and an efficient means of payment. Today\u2019s money gets mixed marks.

Government digital currencies could also expand governments\u2019 toolkits by letting them make instant payments to citizens and cut interest rates below zero. For ordinary users, the appeal of a free, safe, instant, universal means of payment is obvious.\n\nIt is this appeal, though, that creates dangers. Unconstrained, govcoins could fast become a dominant force in finance, particularly if network effects made it hard for people to opt out. They could destabilise banks, because if most people and firms stashed their cash at the central banks, lenders would have to find other sources of funding with which to back their loans.\n\nIf retail banks were sucked dry of funding, someone else would have to do the lending that fuels business creation. This raises the queasy prospect of bureaucrats influencing credit allocation. In a crisis, a digital stampede of savers to the central bank could cause bank runs.\n\nOnce ascendant, govcoins could become panopticons for the state to control citizens: think of instant e-fines for bad behaviour. They could alter geopolitics, too, by providing a conduit for cross-border payments and alternatives to the dollar, the world\u2019s reserve currency and a linchpin of American influence.

She was one of 50,000 people in Shenzhen selected late last year for a trial of China\u2019s digital currency, called eCNY. She downloaded an app, received 200 yuan ($30) from the government and went shopping for books. The app\u2019s display showed a traditional banknote. \u201cIt felt like real money,\u201d she says.\n\nLegally, it is as real as hard cash. All the money in an eCNY app, offered by one of six commercial banks, is backed by an equivalent deposit at the People\u2019s Bank of China. Just as the central bank stands behind any paper yuan, so does it guarantee eCNY. If, say, the commercial bank that made Ms Lu\u2019s digital wallet went bust, her eCNY\u2014linked to her personal-identity number\u2014would be transferred to a new wallet.\n\nCentral banks worldwide are considering issuing digital versions of notes and coins. Although China will not be the first (that honour goes to the Bahamas), it is the most important launching ground. It is the world\u2019s leader in mobile payments (see chart 1). More than half a million people have already received eCNY in trials since last year. China\u2019s central bank is studying how to spread it abroad. Niall Ferguson, a historian, has called on America to wake up to the peril of letting China \u201cmint the money of the future\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s digital currency was first conceived as a way to curb the big mobile-money providers. Now three bold claims are being made about it: that it will dramatically enhance China\u2019s surveillance capabilities; that it will allow the state to wield far more control over money; and that it will challenge the dollar for prominence.\n\nWithin China, however, many economists are far less bullish. The design of the eCNY, and the nature of China\u2019s economic system, mean that each of these claims is unlikely to be realised soon. \u201cThe digital yuan is not magic, so we don\u2019t expect magic from it,\u201d says Gary Liu of the China Financial Reform Institute in Shanghai.\n\nStart with the first claim, that digitisation offers unmatched surveillance abilities, letting the state track all spending. It is not entirely wrong. But it is a limited gain compared with its existing powers.\n\nMost mobile payments today involve a bank card, tethered to users\u2019 accounts on Alipay or WeChat. These must pass through NetsUnion, a central clearing platform. Similarly, foreign-exchange transactions take place on the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. In both cases regulators can see how people spend in real time. For mobile payments that do not touch banks, officials can demand a record and, says an industry insider, may soon require real-time reporting, too.\n\nThe upshot is that, even without eCNY, regulators have no real blind spots left, apart from old-fashioned cash. And so long as millions of older citizens do not much like paying for things with smartphones, the government will not phase out cash.\n\nThe second bold claim about eCNY is that it will reshape monetary policy in China. According to this view, the central bank will be able to program money to be used for specific purposes and at predefined times. This, however, both understates what the central bank can already do and overstates what the eCNY will let it do.\n\nChina already manages both the money supply and interest rates with different sectors in mind. Since 2015, for instance, it has created hundreds of billions of yuan for the construction of affordable housing. More recently it has instructed banks to lower interest rates for small firms.\n\nThe eCNY, one might assume, will make targeting more precise. But its design will circumscribe its role. The central bank will replace only a small portion of base money, known as M0, with eCNY, leaving the rest of the money supply undisturbed (see chart 2). It will distribute eCNY through commercial banks, which in turn will make it available to the public. It will not pay interest on eCNY. And it will probably place low ceilings on how much people can hold.\n\nGranted, the central bank may in time expand the eCNY\u2019s role. But the limitations exist for a reason. The government is wary of undermining the financial system. It does not want savers to switch out of bank deposits en masse into eCNY, which would make it harder for banks to fund themselves. Moreover, few serious economists in Beijing like the idea of a 100% eCNY money supply, in which the government could directly control how banks lend. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to central planning. That would be a mistake,\u201d says Yu Yongding, a former adviser to the central bank.\n\nThe final bold claim is that eCNY will catapult the yuan to global status. But that misunderstands why it accounts for just 2% of international payments today, about the same as the Canadian dollar. When deciding which currencies to use, companies and investors consider how easily they can make conversions to other currencies; how freely they can invest them; and whether they trust the issuing countries\u2019 legal systems. China\u2019s insistence on maintaining far tighter capital controls than any other major economy, as well as deep-seated doubts about its political system, blunt the yuan\u2019s appeal. The limiting factors are policy and politics, not technology.\n\nEven the technological case for eCNY is far from clear-cut. When companies transfer money in and out of China, they already use currency in a digital format: electronic messages on the SWIFT payments network instruct banks to credit accounts in one country and debit them in another. What slows things down is complying with China\u2019s capital controls and with international regulations such as those aimed at stopping money-laundering.\n\nThe eCNY will not eliminate such checks, and the Belgium-headquartered SWIFT system, which connects more than 11,000 financial institutions, is likely to remain the most efficient conduit for sharing payment information across borders. \u201cEven in the long term, SWIFT will remain indispensable,\u201d says Liu Dongmin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nThe three more radical claims about it may not be realised, but will the eCNY fulfil the original aim, of giving the central bank a foothold in the digital-payments universe? Probably, but not a giant one. After the eCNY trial in Shenzhen, Ms Lu said that she would use it for some payments, but that Alipay and WeChat were far more convenient because of how they tie into commercial and social-messaging networks. Mr Liu of the China Financial Reform Institute expects others to concur. He predicts that in three years the eCNY will account for less than 5% of mobile payments.\n\nWestern governments and central bankers mulling digital currencies of their own may wonder if the outcome of the eCNY experiment will contain any lessons for them. But China is unusual in so many ways\u2014from its sheltered financial system and intricate capital controls to the size of its mobile payments\u2014that its experience could well prove to be unique.

She was one of 50,000 people in Shenzhen selected late last year for a trial of China\u2019s digital currency, called eCNY. She downloaded an app, received 200 yuan ($30) from the government and went shopping for books. The app\u2019s display showed a traditional banknote. \u201cIt felt like real money,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n<p>Legally, it is as real as hard cash. All the money in an eCNY app, offered by one of six commercial banks, is backed by an equivalent deposit at the People\u2019s Bank of China. Just as the central bank stands behind any paper yuan, so does it guarantee eCNY. If, say, the commercial bank that made Ms Lu\u2019s digital wallet went bust, her eCNY\u2014linked to her personal-identity number\u2014would be transferred to a new wallet.</p>\n\n<p>Central banks worldwide are considering issuing digital versions of notes and coins. Although China will not be the first (that honour goes to the Bahamas), it is the most important launching ground. It is the world\u2019s leader in mobile payments (see chart 1). More than half a million people have already received eCNY in trials since last year. China\u2019s central bank is studying how to spread it abroad.

Picture the horizon of any big city, and the skyscrapers in view are usually banks. Commuters emerge from Grand Central station in New York in the shadow of the Park Avenue base of JPMorgan Chase. Morgan Stanley looms over Times Square; Bank of America over Bryant Park. In London the skyline is dominated by odd-shaped towers in the City and Canary Wharf. In Singapore the top floors of the offices of Standard Chartered and UOB house rooftop bars looking out over the entire city. Even in places like Auckland, Mexico City or Jakarta, the logos adorning the tallest buildings are those of ANZ, BBVA or HSBC.\n\nThe physical dominance of banks symbolises their importance. Most people interact with their banks for such mundane transactions as buying groceries. Companies pay their workers, suppliers and landlords through banks. Banks are also there for bigger decisions, such as buying a house or getting a student loan.\n\nFor almost as long as there has been money (whether cowrie shells, gold, banknotes or digital deposits),there have been institutions providing safe storage for it. And for as long as deposit-taking institutions have existed, their managers have realised how in normal times not all depositors will demand their money back at once. That means they do not have to keep cash on hand for every deposit\u2014instead they can use the money to make loans. Thus bankers provide funding for private investment and earn interest for themselves. This was a marvel to classical economists. \u201cWe have entirely lost the idea that any undertaking likely to pay, and seen to be likely, can perish for want of money,\u201d wrote Walter Bagehot, then editor of The Economist, in his 1873 book \u201cLombard Street\u201d. \u201cYet no idea was more familiar to our ancestors.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cfractional reserves\u201d that banks hold against their deposits have another effect, however: to make them inherently unstable institutions. The history of capitalism and of money is thus one of relentless economic enrichment, pockmarked by the scars of frequent bank runs and financial crises.\n\nMuch has changed about banking since Bagehot\u2019s day. Then the biggest banks were in London; now they are in New York, Beijing and Tokyo. Technological change means nearly all payments are settled digitally, rather than with notes or cheques. The banks are also far bigger. The total assets of the world\u2019s biggest 1,000 banks were worth some $128trn in 2020, dwarfing annual global gross product of $84.5trn.\n\nAnd yet a world without banks is also visible on the horizon. As never before, their role is under threat from new technology, capital markets and even the public sector. Central bankers have seen tech giants develop quicker and easier payments systems that could pull transactions out of the banking system. They worry that digital payments may bring about the end of cash. Financial regulation and monetary policy have traditionally operated through banks. If this mechanism is lost, they may have to create digital central-bank money instead.\n\nBecause technology has disrupted so many industries, its impact on banking may seem like one more example of a stodgy, uncompetitive business made obsolete by slick tech firms. But money and banking aren\u2019t like taxis or newspapers. They make up the interface between the state and the economy. \u201cThe deep architecture of the money-credit system, better known as banking, hasn\u2019t changed since the 18th century, when Francis Baring began writing about the lender-of-last-resort,\u201d says Sir Paul Tucker, formerly deputy governor of the Bank of England and now at Harvard. \u201cWhich means it has not, so far, depended on technology at all, because Francis Baring was writing about it with a quill pen.\u201d\n\nNow a new architecture is emerging that promises a reckoning. \u201cEconomic action cannot, at least in capitalist society, be explained without taking account of money, and practically all economic propositions are relative to the modus operandi of a given monetary system,\u201d wrote Joseph Schumpeter in 1939. Yet it is possible to see a future in which banks play a smaller role, or even none at all, with digital money and deposits provided by central banks, financial transactions carried out by tech firms and capital markets providing credit.\nBad change or good?\n\nThe question is whether such a world is desirable. Banks have many flaws. Scores of the unbanked are too poor to afford them. They can be slow and expensive. They often make more money from trading and fees, not normal banking. Negligent banks can create boom-and-bust cycles that inflict economic hardship. So it is easy to assume that the sidelining of banks might be just another shackle broken by technological advance.\n\nYet a world without banks poses some problems. Today central banks provide very little to economies. Around 90% of the broad money supply is in bank deposits, underpinned by small reserves held with the central bank and an implicit central-bank guarantee. This makes it easier for central banks to instil confidence in the system while still keeping at arm\u2019s length from credit. Widely used central-bank money would bring them nearer the action, causing their balance-sheets to balloon. This creates risks.\n\nBanking and capitalism are closely linked. Economists still debate why Britain industrialised first, but it is hard to read Bagehot and not conclude that the alchemy of banks turning idle deposits into engines for investment played a part. The question is what happens if central banks play a bigger role instead. It might be possible for them to avoid actually distributing loans, but it is hard to see how they could avoid some interference in credit markets.\n\nThere are broader social risks as well. Banking is fragmented, with three or four big banks in most countries, plus lots of smaller ones. But state-issued digital currencies and private payments platforms benefit from network effects, potentially concentrating power in one or two institutions. This could give governments, or a few private bosses, a wealth of information about citizens.It would also make the institutions a lot more vulnerable. A cyber-attack on the American financial system that closed JPMorgan Chase for a time would be distressing. A similar attack that shut down a Federal Reserve digital currency could be devastating. And there is the potential use of money for social control. Cash is not traceable, but digital money leaves a trail. Exclusively digital money can be programmed, restricting its use. This has benign implications: food stamps could be better targeted or stimulus spending made more effective. But it also has worrying ones: digital money could be programmed to stop it being used to pay for abortions or to buy books from abroad.\n\nThe scope of the issues this special report will consider is vast. It includes the role of the state in credit provision, the concentration of power in tech firms or governments, the potential for social control and the risk of new forms of warfare. A world without banks may sound to many like a dream.

They were saying that they genuinely didn't know of any value in crypto beyond speculation. I took a stab at answering them, and thought I'd post it here too, in case it helps give anyone else a quick starting point for answering similar questions.\n\n> Fundamentals mean, what value does something bring to people, and specifically what value that they are willing to pay for? How can it make itself useful to them in such a way that they want to exchange other units of value for it?\n> \n> For any crypto that is a pure currency (e.g. Bitcoin, Doge, Monero, and like 90% of all the others), that usefulness is limited to peer-to-peer value exchange (which was revolutionary when it first emerged!) You'll also see people arguing that they can be useful as a \"Store of Value\", but that's actually much less related to the protocol itself and more related to how people perceive it. Basically, it's meme power. And in the case of peer-to-peer transfers, Bitcoin in particular is already too expensive, fee-wise, to be useful for the vast majority of transactions. For these currencies, their fundamentals are actually quite restricted in scope, and their prices are therefore almost 100% driven by speculation.\n> \n> Now compare that to Ethereum. Whereas Bitcoin is a two-function calculator (it can add and subtract), Ethereum is a general-purpose programmable computer. It is basically your smartphone in comparison, which can be loaded with any dApp you want and can therefore become literally any type of financial tool you want, if someone has written the right dApp to do that thing. And many thousands of dApps have been written by now!\n> \n> As a few small examples of that utility, mostly from DeFi (decentralized finance, a concept which exists almost entirely on Ethereum), you can do the following:\n> \n> * Maintain a coin at a certain value, like $1 USD (called a stablecoin). This is vastly more useful for actual peer-to-peer value transfer than something like Bitcoin, which fluctuates wildly in value.\n>\n>\n> * Take out trustless, collateralized loans against any crypto-asset you hold on Ethereum. If you had 1 Eth, you could, right now, take out up to around $2,000 USD (in stablecoins) in a loan, without selling your Eth. Obviously there are risks there, but it's extremely useful in a number of applications.\n> \n> * Exchange your Eth or tokens for other tokens, again completely trustlessly, on a Dex (decentralized exchange)\n> \n> * Provide liquidity for a Dex (provide the coins that people want to trade), and earn a % of every transaction. So-called yield-farming is hugely lucrative right now (we're talking 20% APY+, and totally non-scammy, believe it or not)\n> \n> * Mint NFTs and, if you're a good artist or a famous person, sell them for real $ to people who want to collect them\n> \n> * Stake your Ether and secure the Ethereum network, for a decent 5%+ APY.\n> \n> And the list goes on and on and on. The uses are literally infinite and endless. These are all applications that exist on Ethereum right now, not in the future.\n> \n> That is *value*. That is *utility*. Most cryptos can't do that, either because they lack smart contracts (the key innovation that allows Ethereum to have these infinite use cases), or because they don't have the massive network effects that Ethereum does, being the first true smart-contract crypto. People are calling this effect \"Money Legos\".\n> \n> Right now, things are still in their infancy, but everyone who is educated in this space sees the writing on the wall: The world financial system is likely to be running on crypto before the end of the decade, much less two decades. And Ethereum is very likely to be the crypto that secures all of this.\n> \n> Right now, Ethereum is pulling in around $20M USD in fees per day. People are willing to pay that much to use the network for all of the above applications. Imagine how high that could go if it truly becomes the underlying framework for the world's financial system.\n> \n> That is the value that I, as a value investor, am seeking out here. I'm not speculating that I will make money because a bunch of people will want to buy Ethereum in the future (though they will). I am investing in the potential infinite usefulness that Ethereum represents, the real value that it provides to its users, and that they are willing to pay for.\n> \n> I hope that helps you understand that Crypto is no longer just cryptocurrencies. It's the future of finance.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>One of the people in the Ethereum Classic PSA thread was asking me what fundamentals crypto has.

I took a stab at answering them, and thought I&#39;d post it here too, in case it helps give anyone else a quick starting point for answering similar questions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fundamentals mean, what value does something bring to people, and specifically what value that they are willing to pay for? How can it make itself useful to them in such a way that they want to exchange other units of value for it?</p>\n\n<p>For any crypto that is a pure currency (e.g. Bitcoin, Doge, Monero, and like 90% of all the others), that usefulness is limited to peer-to-peer value exchange (which was revolutionary when it first emerged!) You&#39;ll also see people arguing that they can be useful as a &quot;Store of Value&quot;, but that&#39;s actually much less related to the protocol itself and more related to how people perceive it. Basically, it&#39;s meme power. And in the case of peer-to-peer transfers, Bitcoin in particular is already too expensive, fee-wise, to be useful for the vast majority of transactions. For these currencies, their fundamentals are actually quite restricted in scope, and their prices are therefore almost 100% driven by speculation.</p>\n\n<p>Now compare that to Ethereum. Whereas Bitcoin is a two-function calculator (it can add and subtract), Ethereum is a general-purpose programmable computer. It is basically your smartphone in comparison, which can be loaded with any dApp you want and can therefore become literally any type of financial tool you want, if someone has written the right dApp to do that thing. And many thousands of dApps have been written by now!</p>\n\n<p>As a few small examples of that utility, mostly from DeFi (decentralized finance, a concept which exists almost entirely on Ethereum), you can do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Maintain a coin at a certain value, like $1 USD (called a stablecoin). This is vastly more useful for actual peer-to-peer value transfer than something like Bitcoin, which fluctuates wildly in value.</p></li>\n<li><p>Take out trustless, collateralized loans against any crypto-asset you hold on Ethereum. If you had 1 Eth, you could, right now, take out up to around $2,000 USD (in stablecoins) in a loan, without selling your Eth. Obviously there are risks there, but it&#39;s extremely useful in a number of applications.</p></li>\n<li><p>Exchange your Eth or tokens for other tokens, again completely trustlessly, on a Dex (decentralized exchange)</p></li>\n<li><p>Provide liquidity for a Dex (provide the coins that people want to trade), and earn a % of every transaction. So-called yield-farming is hugely lucrative right now (we&#39;re talking 20% APY+, and totally non-scammy, believe it or not)</p></li>\n<li><p>Mint NFTs and, if you&#39;re a good artist or a famous person, sell them for real $ to people who want to collect them</p></li>\n<li><p>Stake your Ether and secure the Ethereum network, for a decent 5%+ APY.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And the list goes on and on and on. The uses are literally infinite and endless. These are all applications that exist on Ethereum right now, not in the future.</p>\n\n<p>That is <em>value</em>. That is <em>utility</em>. Most cryptos can&#39;t do that, either because they lack smart contracts (the key innovation that allows Ethereum to have these infinite use cases), or because they don&#39;t have the massive network effects that Ethereum does, being the first true smart-contract crypto. People are calling this effect &quot;Money Legos&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, things are still in their infancy, but everyone who is educated in this space sees the writing on the wall: The world financial system is likely to be running on crypto before the end of the decade, much less two decades. And Ethereum is very likely to be the crypto that secures all of this.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, Ethereum is pulling in around $20M USD in fees per day. People are willing to pay that much to use the network for all of the above applications. Imagine how high that could go if it truly becomes the underlying framework for the world&#39;s financial system.</p>\n\n<p>That is the value that I, as a value investor, am seeking out here. I&#39;m not speculating that I will make money because a bunch of people will want to buy Ethereum in the future (though they will). I am investing in the potential infinite usefulness that Ethereum represents, the real value that it provides to its users, and that they are willing to pay for.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that helps you understand that Crypto is no longer just cryptocurrencies. It&#39;s the future of finance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-07 10:47:51","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-05-07 20:40:10","id":"gxardzo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n6qs6z","parent_id":"t3_n6qs6z","score":53,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/MerkleChainsaw","body":"Great write up.

Basically they're Pseudo-Random Number Generators with a seed that they know, and that YubiCo the company knows. That way only the key, and YubiCo, can generate the next 'random' number in the chain, and so by comparing those two, they can verify that you physically have the key. And since it's a different number each time, an attacker can't just replay the same number to get access again, and they can't predict the next one from the previous number. It's pretty cool.\n\nOkay, so what if instead of YubiCo having the copy of the seed, it was a zkSnark on Ethereum/an L2?

Basically they&#39;re Pseudo-Random Number Generators with a seed that they know, and that YubiCo the company knows. That way only the key, and YubiCo, can generate the next &#39;random&#39; number in the chain, and so by comparing those two, they can verify that you physically have the key. And since it&#39;s a different number each time, an attacker can&#39;t just replay the same number to get access again, and they can&#39;t predict the next one from the previous number.
