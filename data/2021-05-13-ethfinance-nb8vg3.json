You can&#39;t have a parabolic move month by month from here until PoS (later on this year).</p>\n\n<p>The narratives for ETH are still intact: EIP-1559 with a burning supply in July. PoS with lowering issuance + new issuance going to holders instead of miners. And maybe now the most important narrative ETH has as BTC competitor: It will be eco-friendly.</p>\n\n<p>I may be wrong with my analysis, but I&#39;m confident with it.</p>\n\n<p>Keep a cool head\n during crazy times.

Many of which are live on mainnet now. ctivity on these networks is also growing very fast!\n- **DeFi and Composability** - Money legos and open source code allowing for fast development and unprecedented innovation in the world of finance.\n- **NFTs and tokenisation** - Tokenise everything. No, seriously. So much more than just art NFTs.\n- **Institutional Adoption** - Ethereum has the most enterprise partners (EEA) + the Baseline protocol is bullish AF.\n- **Institutional Investment** - Grayscale investments now owns 2% of ETH supply and Canada ha an ETH ETF. Just wait until companies figure out ETH is a deflationary, dividend paying/stakable, environmentally friendly, more advanced version of Bitcoin.\n- **The state of global markets** - Crypto may be at all-time highs now but so is almost every asset class and the system Ethereum wants to replace is looking very broken.\n- **Improving UX and abstracting away complexity** - Human readable addresses and smart contract wallets which even your mother could use.\n- **The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer** - No ETH killer clearly sticks out from the rest. This makes it hard for one of them to create a big network effect.\n- **Network effects** - Ethereum has by far the largest network effect and as Bitcoin has shown us, the network effect is extremely important.\n- **Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform** - Super secure under ETH 2.0, no more tolerance of DAO like forks and a neutral platform for adversaries like the US and China to transact on so that they don\u2019t have to trust each other\u2019s banks.\n- **ETH distribution is decentralised** - Years of proof of work have put ETH in the hands of many.

Here is the article.\n\nBinance Holdings Ltd. is under investigation by the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service, ensnaring the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange in U.S. efforts to root out illicit activity that\u2019s thrived in the red-hot but mostly unregulated market.\n\nAs part of the inquiry, officials who probe money laundering and tax offenses have sought information from individuals with insight into Binance\u2019s business, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the probe is confidential. Led by Changpeng Zhao, a charismatic tech executive who relishes promoting tokens on Twitter and in media interviews, Binance has leap-frogged rivals since he co-founded it in 2017.\n\nThe firm, like the industry it operates in, has succeeded largely outside the scope of government oversight. Binance is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and has an office in Singapore but says it lacks a single corporate headquarters. Chainalysis Inc., a blockchain forensics firm whose clients include U.S. federal agencies, concluded last year that among transactions that it examined, more funds tied to criminal activity flowed through Binance than any other crypto exchange.\n\n\u201cWe take our legal obligations very seriously and engage with regulators and law enforcement in a collaborative fashion,\u201d Binance spokeswoman Jessica Jung said in an emailed statement, while adding that the company doesn\u2019t comment on specific matters or inquiries. \u201cWe have worked hard to build a robust compliance program that incorporates anti-money laundering principles and tools used by financial institutions to detect and address suspicious activity.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department and IRS declined to comment.\n\nU.S. Concerns\nU.S. officials have expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies are being used to conceal illegal transactions, including theft and drug deals, and that Americans who\u2019ve made windfalls betting on the market\u2019s meteoric rise are evading taxes. Such worries have been a hindrance to the industry going mainstream, even as Wall Street increasingly embraces Bitcoin and other tokens amid a global investing frenzy.\n\n\nThis month\u2019s cyber-attack against Colonial Pipeline Co. that\u2019s triggered fuel shortages across the Eastern U.S. is the latest sign of what\u2019s at stake. Colonial paid Eastern European hackers a nearly $5 million ransom in untraceable cryptocurrency within hours of the breach, Bloomberg News reported Thursday, citing two people familiar with the matter.\n\nREAD BLOOMBERG\u2019S COVERAGE OF BINANCE:\nBinance Coin\u2019s Surge Elevates Token to Ranks of Crypto Titans\nBinance CEO Goes All-in on Tokens: \u2018I Just Want to Keep Crypto\u2019\nBinance Probed by U.S. Over Whether U.S. Residents Traded\nWhile the Justice Department and IRS probe potential criminal violations, the specifics of what the agencies are examining couldn\u2019t be determined, and not all inquiries lead to allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nThe officials involved include prosecutors within the Justice Department\u2019s bank integrity unit, which probes complex cases targeting financial firms, and investigators from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Seattle. The scrutiny by IRS agents goes back months, with their questions signaling that they\u2019re reviewing both the conduct of Binance\u2019s customers and its employees, another person said.\n\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has also been investigating Binance over whether it permitted Americans to make illegal trades, Bloomberg reported in March. In that case, authorities have been examining whether Binance let investors buy derivatives that are linked to digital tokens. U.S. residents are barred from purchasing such products unless the firms offering them are registered with the CFTC.\n\nAnalyzing Transactions\nZhao has said Binance closely follows U.S. rules, blocks Americans from its website, and uses advanced technology to analyze transactions for signs of money laundering and other illicit activity. Last year, the firm warned that U.S. residents would have their accounts frozen if they were found to be trading, crypto trade publications have reported.\n\nThe inquiries follow a Chainalysis report on criminal transactions involving digital tokens. The firm tracked Bitcoin worth $2.8 billion that it suspects crooks moved on to trading platforms in 2019. Chainalysis determined that roughly 27%, or $756 million, wound up on Binance. Binance responded by saying it adheres to all anti-money laundering regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and works with partners like Chainalysis to improve its systems.\n\nIn the U.S., authorities have been cracking down on exchanges for flouting laws that are meant to prevent financial crimes, with officials citing the platforms use by terrorists and hackers. Tax violations have also been a priority, with the government recently winning a court order as it seeks to unmask U.S. clients of Kraken, a San Francisco-based exchange.\n\n\nIn October, federal prosecutors in Manhattan announced charges against the founders of Seychelles-based BitMEX, accusing them of violating the Bank Secrecy Act by permitting thousands of U.S. customers to trade while publicly claiming to restrict their access. The claims included failing to register as a futures merchant with the CFTC and not having adequate anti-money laundering controls. Three of the BitMex officials pleaded not guilty and a trial has been scheduled for March 2022. One remains at large.\n\nWashington Presence\nWith the U.S. circling, Binance has stepped up its presence in Washington and retained a former Treasury Department official and top white-collar defense lawyers to represent it in legal cases and matters being reviewed by regulators. In March, the firm tapped former U.S. Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, to advise it on policy and government relations.\n\n\nIn September 2019, Zhao launched Binance.US, also known as BAM Trading Services Inc., to cater to American clients. Brian Brooks, who was a top banking regulator when he led the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency during the Trump administration, became chief executive officer of Binance.US this month.\n\nAmid the hiring blitz, the company has popped up in U.S. cases tied to criminal activity. In February, two Florida men were charged with running an online fentanyl trafficking operation, with one of them accused of depositing the proceeds in a Binance account. That same month, the Justice Department sought the forfeiture of cryptocurrency worth $450,000 traced from ransomware attacks that hit several U.S. companies to a Binance account held by a 20-year-old Ukrainian national. The government didn\u2019t accuse Binance of wrongdoing in either enforcement action.\n\nDisguising Locations\nAlong with the CFTC, the Justice Department is likely to examine steps that Binance has taken to keep U.S. residents off its exchange. One person familiar with Binance\u2019s operations said that prior to the establishment of Binance.US, Americans were advised to use a virtual proxy network, or VPN, to disguise their locations when seeking to access the exchange.\n\nJung, the Binance spokeswoman, said the exchange has never encouraged U.S. residents to use VPNs to get around its rules, as doing so would be something \u201cthat has always been contrary to our company\u2019s principles.\u201d In January, Zhao tweeted that Binance\u2019s security systems block Americans even if they try to connect through one of the networks.\n\n\u201cWe have implemented strong access controls that have been tested via external audit and are under continuous review and evaluation by Binance to ensure that the appropriate restrictions are in place and are effective,\u201d Jung said.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Behind paywall.
