At PE 10 if the DAI outstanding and MKR price just sit there that would mean 10% of the outstanding coins would be bought back and burnt this year. There is just no way you can buy 90k MKR without affecting the price. And even if you did I can hold for 10 years until I&#39;m literally the last guy holding and selling Maker for millions each because the system has no choice but to buy it back from me at the price I ask and burn it.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine there was a company. That company was showing 1000% adoption growth per year. That company was committing to using 100% of its profit to buyback its&#39; shares. What do you think the PE of that company would be? 1000? MKR is less than 20. It&#39;s priced like Proctor and Gamble while it is demonstrably an incredible growth stock. There is nothing anywhere in the traditional equity markets with the same potential as these numbers.</p>\n\n<p>And despite that, ETH could still outperform it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-22 09:47:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gz2jz94","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nib62x","parent_id":"t1_gz2hwhs","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/jumnhy","body":"This certainly seems like the time, amigo.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This certainly seems like the time, amigo.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-22 17:19:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gz40ssb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nib62x","parent_id":"t1_gz16zzl","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/etherbie","body":"OPTIMISM, ARBITRUM, EIP1559, MERGE\n\nAll this year....\n\nLet\u2019s just leave it at that.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>OPTIMISM, ARBITRUM, EIP1559, MERGE</p>\n\n<p>All this year....</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s just leave it at that.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-22 03:31:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gz1jw9k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nib62x","parent_id":"t3_nib62x","score":36,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/elbeem","body":"I wouldn't count on the merge happening his year.

And wasn&#39;t at all shocked to see a little more stability with BTC due to what the last month looked like for BTCUSD, ETHUSD and ETH/BTC. However, I was a lot more optimistic for our bounce back. And maybe I&#39;m too impatient (it really hasn&#39;t been <em>that</em> long yet) but this is getting out of control fast considered we STILL sit under 50% of BTC&#39;s marketcap. </p>\n\n<p>I echo&#39;d it below, but I&#39;m starting to wonder if we just are living in the multiverse where Ethereum simply has to prove itself before what we know is true gets reflected in the broader market. Although a lot of what you listed is already happening, so who knows. Its all bullshit if true anyway considering what ADA has pulled off price wise, the king of nothing to show for itself. I mean I shudder to think it might be as simple as the price not being under $10 a share...</p>\n\n<p>I think I can officially make my call that the market is behaving irrationally if we still sit a .06 (or lower) next week.

YMMV","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There are billions of dollars moving within the DeFi space on ethereum currently, with people lending, borrowing, providing liquidity- tons of opportunities for putting up collateral to borrow or lend for yields orders of magnitude above what is typically available in the traditional finance sector.  Lots of good resources to read about this, you can reference some of the links in the sticky for starters.  While the recent NFT craze is mostly hype driven nonsense in my opinion, that type of digital art ownership isn\u2019t going away and will mature with time.  There have been small instances of people dipping their toes in use of NFTs / smart contracts for releasing music and for real estate purposes, both of those use cases have seemingly massive potential in the not too distant future... but yes, aside from DeFi a not insignificant portion of the value is related to increased future use.  Compared to all other block chains, though, defi alone has significant real world usage and I would push back a bit on your concept that it has little utility to the average person.  I almost never discuss blockchain outside of a very small group of friends, but I know a few other people who got into the space on their own and have at least started dabbling with using defi.

Nodes are designed to only hold on to a certain amount of transactions and to drop low fee transactions if they run out of memory. I have tried this myself on Etherscan. If you submit a 1 gwei transaction right now, it will show up as pending, but wait a few days and it&#39;ll be gone. This is because the ethereum nodes have dropped your tx in order to save memory. Fees also will spike, but will not spike into the million dollar range. That&#39;s just absolutely ridiculous. Also, a 70% hashrate collapse will make US and European miners about 4x more profitable (not including the way higher fee revenue), meaning that more miners will be turned on and cause the hashrate to rise again, so the difference will probably go to less than 50% within a few days at most. This is just ridiculous FUD and will not happen.</p>\n\n<p>Also if what you said about the backlog was true, then anyone can completely fuck the network right now by sending millions of transactions at the lowest fee rate (1 satoshi), even without the hashrate dropping.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-21 23:11:56","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-05-21 23:18:53","id":"gz13qbq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nib62x","parent_id":"t1_gz11pbe","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"So, to clarify, if China did indeed ban BTC mining, you truly feel the mining demand would be picked up elsewhere and not result in a massive drop?
