I only started Reddit due to ethfinance. I followed it for some month and learned. Then, after 6 month, I was brave enough to make my first comment. After hitting reply, the bot said to me \u201eyou need 20 Karma to post\u201c. I was so sad. \ud83d\ude2d Didn\u2019t even know, what karma was before. So I went to a soccer sub and posted some stupid comments like \u201eyeah you are right\u201c and waited till eventually 2 people upvoted.</p>\n\n<p>So how is it possible to have 1.000 posts at ethfinance without first gaining some karma somewhere else?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-26 12:29:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gzjuoi7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nl8swe","parent_id":"t1_gzjlt17","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"More times than I can count the mods have manually approved users in a daily (for instance) who only have something to say and then get dogpiled with karma.

The idea was that as more of these big financial institutions began purchasing and holding bitcoin,  they would be have incentives to try and prevent giant 30+% crashes.\n\n\nWhile we haven't reached full adoption of Bitcoin as a Store of Value, we are closer than we ever have been. Companies have Bitcoin on their balance sheets, ETFs are popping up, and banks are seriously still looking into Cryptocurrencies for what seems like 10 years now, and the list goes on. \n\n\nOne would think that even with these incremental signs of adoption, we should start seeing less severe dips and crashes. But as the past two weeks have shown us, Bitcoin is still capable of these massive crashes.\n\n\nThis then had me thinking about Ethereum. But just thinking about the price seems a bit narrow minded when it comes to Ethereum.\nSo I went on a journey.\n\n[Ether is the worlds first Triple Point Asset](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/ether-is-the-best-model-for-money) - Capital, Consumable/Transformable, and Store of Value, asset. Ethereum is the base layer - the foundation - for Decentralized Finance. Everything else is built on it. As Ethereum gains more adoption, it will be a vital part of the financial industry. And while \"The base layer for Financial Transactions\" is already saying a lot, Ethereum is more than just a financial layer. NFTs, record keeping, digital identity, tokenization, etc. All of that and more will be happening on Ethereum. It is 100% guarunteed that the permissionless, programmable, store of value, side of this equation continues to grow. [We already see Dai growth increasing year over year.](https://blog.makerdao.com/zero-to-one-billion-dai-five-years-of-growth-for-makerdao/)  The permissionless (Decentralized finance) aspect has room for massive growth. But the other side of the coin, I feel is much more important. Physical world companies (non DAOs) and institutions are still bounded by laws and regulations. As Ethereum permeates throughout society and becomes adopted, it will become vital to everyday life.\n\n\nFirst, products will increasingly make use of Ethereum's open network of value. NFTs, Record Keeping, digital identity, tokenization of real world assets, supply chain, oracles, the list is really endless here. Needless to say, adoption will be massive. There will be so many real world usage of Ethereum that we will see a smooth transition into Ether on balance sheets.\n\n\nSecond, companies will begin buying and holding Ethereum. In addition to the basic \"you can earn a yield from it\", they may also just need to buy ETH to transact on the network. At some point companies will need to interact with the network. They will either transact on the network themselves or through a payment network like Visa, Mastercard, Coinbase, etc. But the fact that Bitcoin, an entirely unproductive asset, is on a few balance sheets already, means ETH will surely surpass Bitcoin adoption in this regard.\n\nThird - due to globalization, Ethereum's roots will grow to become a vital part of the worlds infrastructure in the same way the internet has. International companies wanting to handle contracts, records, licenses, etc. will need to operate via Ethereum in at least one point in their process. \n\nHow much value will be transferred via Ethereum if all of this comes true? [This quarter alone saw $1.5 trillion of value transferred on Ethereum and there is so much room to grow.](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1384676842045681664?s=19) I think it's safe to say that hundreds of Trillions of dollars...maybe even...dare I say...Quadrillion+ worth of value a year.\n\nWhat will the marketcap of Ethereum be at this point?\n\nAnd unlike Bitcoin, the underlying value of Ethereum will directly be tied to its security due to Proof of Stake. The higher the value for ETH the less likely the network could be attacked.\n\nAnd this leads me to my main point.\n\n\nAt what point will the safety of Ethereum become a national security issue for the worlds governments? When will operating a node and validator be seen as critical infrastructure? When a sizable amount of the worlds financial infrastructure, records, digital/tokenized value, is on a decentralized network, I can't help but think they will allocate some amount of resources to keeping it decentralized. Especially If quadrillions worth of value is being transferred on it  \n\n \nDifferent government may try to do different things. Some countries will encourage validator and node operations within their borders, in order to make sure no other government can gain a majority stake and affect the network. Others will possibly try less effective methods to increase there voting share over the Network of Value.\n\n\nThis is the endgame with Ethereum. Will Ethereum become too big to fail? It's an asset the world has never seen before. How much would the internet be valued at today? The amount of value being sent everyday on the internet is immense and difficult to quantify. The value of Ethereum may just hit that level of obfuscation. With layer 2s, and private payment networks like Visa, the public may not even know that they are using Ethereum. But Ethereum will still have value because it is the Base Layer of Value for the internet.\n\nWill it be too big to fail? Even after all what I wrote, I highly doubt it ever gets to the point so extreme where nation states are vying over as much ETH as possible. \n\nHowever, in going through that journey, I realized something very important.\n\n\nI cannot foresee a scenario where Bitcoin even touches a level of importance as this.

We knew that shorts had to buy a huge number of shares and would basically be forced to pay whatever the market was charging, so by reducing liquidity their buys created more slippage and drove the price significantly higher.</p>\n\n<p>But cryptos aren&#39;t GME. There aren&#39;t enough shorts to &quot;squeeze&quot; DOGE so nobody&#39;s being forced to buy it even at absurd prices. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why I think the &quot;diamond hands&quot; meme is harmful to novice investors, they think if they hold DOGE long enough they&#39;ll be rich but that&#39;s literally not how it works. Someone would have to buy it from you at that crazy price, and since it&#39;s not a squeezed hedge fund you&#39;re just hoping for a &quot;greater fool&quot; to come along.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-26 20:15:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gzlgcj4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nl8swe","parent_id":"t3_nl8swe","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/BUTT_SMELLS_LIKE_POO","body":"Always updoop the dingly.

The Max Kaiser interview on Alex Jones.   I wonder what others here would think of that.   No fewer than once every two minutes, Max would say \"BTC is the only real Crypto Currency.   ETH and all other coins and junk\".    And it seemed he was pushing a new website to purchase BTC.   Saying that he helped develop it and was also a main proponent of this website.   That all said, Max claims to own a massive trove of BTC - at least 50k BTC by my estimation.\n\nI kept on thinking, if he had that many BTC, then why push people to use this new website to purchase BTC.   Where Max would earn a commission on each BTC sold.  Why not instead be a casual and carefree BTC \"OG\" and encourage people to get into the space, and not just BTC.    He was not coming off as an easy breezy billionaire.  He really did come across as a snake oil salesman.
