So I really applaud the kind of thesis driven investors that went in at that time, but I think also, my hope is that they don't just sell for there 10x, 20x, 30x now and just move on, because I have seen alot of people do that. The thing I tell alot of crypto natives, if all you do is talk to natives all day and everyone is saying, we're all too rich now, we have to sell because everyone is too rich. Actually no you happen to have bought in during the bear market of one of the best assets in the history of assets and you bought it with your friends. **You actually deserve to be rich, you don't have to be ashamed of it you can just prefer to just keep staying rich.** That kind of PTSD from the bear market I actually think has caused alot of people to sell to early on the way up...So I think you want to give time for the full Ethereum vision to play out...So I think there is a whole lot of misunderstanding even now with ether at 4K about what it is and what the true vision can be, so I would like to see all that play out...I think we'll go over 25K at least\"\n\n\\-did my best to paraphrase Su Zhu of Three Arrows Capital (one of the largest Eth holders) from Bankless episode recorded 5/12. If you want to go listen for yourself this was a great episode and the quote from above starts at the 1:01:06 mark. Personally, I have found Bankless podcasts to be one of the top sources of crypto information out there, so definitely go check them out if you haven't yet. \n\nMy takeaway to close: Do not let your PTSD from the 3-year bear market get the best of you (think Amazon in 2000). This quote from Su Zhu was something I thought of often during the dip this last week. My words of advice to new investors, be careful out there, use leverage wisely and don't let anyone take your ether from you at these prices. The need to get rich quick isn't the problem its the need to get rich instantly that will kill you. \n\nMy closing recommendation is for everyone to take the two hours to read this document from Squish Chaos: \n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view)\n\nIf you have invested any amount of money, you should do yourself a favor and think about the time it took you to earn that money. Many people will take there hard earned money they spent hours upon hours of their time to accrue, but then throw it into an investment without spending any time on research. This is the perfect recipe for getting shaken out on a dip like last week. Doing your own research breeds conviction in your investment positions, which is needed at times like that. This can only be gained by putting the time in. I have recommended this paper by Squish (with the disclaimer that the 150K price target is a function of Squish acknowledging that analysts are typically wrong by a significant amount to either the upside or the downside) to all my friends and family (mostly new 2021 investors) and I don't think one person has taken the time to read it. His price estimate aside, this is one of the best investment case thesis I've seen in the crypto space and I really hope anyone putting their hard earned money into ether would take the time out (2 hours is a lot, but the alpha in this document will pay dividends far beyond that) to read it. \n\n**We are still early, and I personally cannot even consider selling before two major catalysts (EIP 1559 and merge to ETH 2.0) play out.** This adds to what Su Zhu said on the Bankless podcast, where people need to give time for the full Ethereum vision to play out. Think about how many new entrants (i.e. institutional investors) cannot take the risk until Eth 2.0 and the merge fully occur, but an individual investor can. As an individual investor we have an edge over institutions, because you are only responsible to yourself, not shareholders or stakeholders, no real red tape for individual to invest in a new innovative market (institutional bureaucracy and investment in a \"risky\" asset like ethereum takes a long time for approval)  and we have an unlimited investment horizon (varies depending on people's circumstances), unlike institutions (have to report P&L's monthly, quarterly reports, etc.). \n\nI know this is a long post, but felt the need to give my two cents and give back to this thread (first ethtrader now ethfinance), after all I've taken over the last four years..","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>&quot;I think that the risk reward for ether is better now, than it was before, arguably a better risk reward now than it was during the deep bear market (2018-2020) where you really have to be a true believer and kind of be a deep tech thesis driven investor because your getting dumped on by everyone at that time. So I really applaud the kind of thesis driven investors that went in at that time, but I think also, my hope is that they don&#39;t just sell for there 10x, 20x, 30x now and just move on, because I have seen alot of people do that. The thing I tell alot of crypto natives, if all you do is talk to natives all day and everyone is saying, we&#39;re all too rich now, we have to sell because everyone is too rich. Actually no you happen to have bought in during the bear market of one of the best assets in the history of assets and you bought it with your friends. <strong>You actually deserve to be rich, you don&#39;t have to be ashamed of it you can just prefer to just keep staying rich.</strong> That kind of PTSD from the bear market I actually think has caused alot of people to sell to early on the way up...So I think you want to give time for the full Ethereum vision to play out...So I think there is a whole lot of misunderstanding even now with ether at 4K about what it is and what the true vision can be, so I would like to see all that play out...I think we&#39;ll go over 25K at least&quot;</p>\n\n<p>-did my best to paraphrase Su Zhu of Three Arrows Capital (one of the largest Eth holders) from Bankless episode recorded 5/12. If you want to go listen for yourself this was a great episode and the quote from above starts at the 1:01:06 mark. Personally, I have found Bankless podcasts to be one of the top sources of crypto information out there, so definitely go check them out if you haven&#39;t yet. </p>\n\n<p>My takeaway to close: Do not let your PTSD from the 3-year bear market get the best of you (think Amazon in 2000). This quote from Su Zhu was something I thought of often during the dip this last week. My words of advice to new investors, be careful out there, use leverage wisely and don&#39;t let anyone take your ether from you at these prices. The need to get rich quick isn&#39;t the problem its the need to get rich instantly that will kill you. </p>\n\n<p>My closing recommendation is for everyone to take the two hours to read this document from Squish Chaos: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view</a></p>\n\n<p>If you have invested any amount of money, you should do yourself a favor and think about the time it took you to earn that money. Many people will take there hard earned money they spent hours upon hours of their time to accrue, but then throw it into an investment without spending any time on research. This is the perfect recipe for getting shaken out on a dip like last week. Doing your own research breeds conviction in your investment positions, which is needed at times like that.

I figured it would be good to post here too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring a PoW 51% attack you can keep attacking the network for as long as you maintain the majority of the network hashrate. The network can't stop this without switching algorithms which would also prevent all honest ASIC owners from mining the chain. The ETH2 PoS implementation has many security advantages against these type of network takeover attacks.\r  \n\r  \n1. It actually requires over two thirds of the network to control it as opposed to over one half with a PoW network.\r  \n\r  \n2. Only 4 validators per epoch can be added to the network. This means that there is a very large queue. Even if no more honest validators were added to the queue from this day forward, it would take roughly 12 months for an attacker to control two thirds of the active validators.\r  \n\r  \n3. The upfront cost is much higher. It would require 9M ETH to have enough validators to control over two thirds of the network (assuming not a single additional honest validators is added to the queue). At the current price of $2750/ETH, that would be $24.75B at the current spot price. However, the act of buying that much ETH would increase the price significantly so in reality the upfront cost would be much higher. The upfront cost of 51% attacking Bitcoin would be the cost of manufacturing enough ASICs to exceed the current total network hashrate. It is currently roughly 150M Th/s. For reference, the new Antminer S19 Pro which is manufactured on TSMC's 5nm node has a hashrate of 110Th/s. It would require 1.363M of these to exceed the current total hashrate of the entire network. Assuming you could build 10 of these machines from each 300mm TSMC 5nm wafer, it would require 136,300 wafers. At a current price of $17k per wafer, that would be about $2.317B and it would take about 5 weeks of the full TSMC 5nm production capacity. The machines also have some additional expense for the network interface, case, and motherboard, so we can double the cost to roughly $5B.\r  \n\r  \n4. Slashing. This is probably the biggest limiting factor for this type of attack against ETH 2 PoS. Even if you assume some entity overcomes all the obstacles mentioned above and they successfully attacked the network, the community would just adopt the \"minority\" fork that is not controlled by the attacker. Since ETH2 has slashing for any attempted attacks, that means on the fork that all ETH users switch to (the one that isn't being attacked), the attacker's ETH will actually be burned. That means they can not attempt a second attack without going through all of the above steps again (which would take a year at minimum and probably even more money than the first attack since they have directly caused 9M ETH to get permanently burned from the supply.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I posted this in response to someone saying that PoW networks are more resistant to majority network takeover style attacks.

At a current price of $17k per wafer, that would be about $2.317B and it would take about 5 weeks of the full TSMC 5nm production capacity. The machines also have some additional expense for the network interface, case, and motherboard, so we can double the cost to roughly $5B.</p></li>\n<li><p>Slashing. This is probably the biggest limiting factor for this type of attack against ETH 2 PoS. Even if you assume some entity overcomes all the obstacles mentioned above and they successfully attacked the network, the community would just adopt the &quot;minority&quot; fork that is not controlled by the attacker. Since ETH2 has slashing for any attempted attacks, that means on the fork that all ETH users switch to (the one that isn&#39;t being attacked), the attacker&#39;s ETH will actually be burned. That means they can not attempt a second attack without going through all of the above steps again (which would take a year at minimum and probably even more money than the first attack since they have directly caused 9M ETH to get permanently burned from the supply.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-27 13:44:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gzoiwep","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nlzzgq","parent_id":"t3_nlzzgq","score":29,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/MerkleChainsaw","body":"Nice writeup.
