For example, if your target price was $5k, why not take the same amount and sell it on a bell curve around the $5k price? Maybe 10% each at 3k and 7k, 20% each at 4K and 6k, and the rest at 5k. This \u201ceventually\u201d hits and averages out to the same price target, and it allows you to protect against the potential that one single price doesn\u2019t get hit on any particular run. You could even go wider than that if you wanted.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-05-30 01:07:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"gzyfjme","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nmq84n","parent_id":"t1_gzune3b","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/heyheeyheeey","body":"Definitely, I've been debating between lumpsum and more spread out, and actually did take something like 15% out at $3.5K.
