On the 1st day, the underlying asset goes up 10%, so it's now worth $110 and your 2x leveraged position is up to $120. On the 2nd day, the underlying asset drops 10% so now it's worth $99 *($110 - (10% * $110))* but your 2x leveraged position is worth $96 *($120 - (20% * $120))*. Now all of a sudden, your leveraged position is worth 4% less than what you put in, but the underlying asset has only decreased by 1%. Now that underlying asset can absolutely appreciate over time, but if the price fluctuates up and down day to day, it can draw down the value of your leveraged position and eat away at any gains you may capture from the leveraged product. That phenomenon is called **volatility decay**, and it's the primary reason you don't want to hold a leveraged product like ETH2x-FLI for too long (aka more than a couple months).

It\u2019s similar to support/resistance but slightly more \u201cscientific\u201d. Basically you look at the amount of trading volume at each price level. You will notice most trading is concentrated at various levels with minimal trading volume inbetween. The major trading levels essentially serve as a \u201cpoint of control\u201d where if it goes above there is minimal resistance so it will keep shooting up for a while. If it falls below there is minimal support so it will keep falling for a while. For ETH 2400-2500 was a POC area. The next area below is 1850-1950.</p>\n\n<p>Again this isn\u2019t necessarily some magic formula. All it does is give us insight into where other market participants have strong opinions on price.
