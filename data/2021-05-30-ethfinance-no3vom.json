I'm extremely excited to report that my validator finally activated over the weekend, and is now helping to secure the Beacon Chain, and in the future the Ethereum mainnet!\n\nThis is a big moment for me personally, finally helping to run Ethereum after years of just learning about it, buying it, using it, and even doing some development on it. It feels like I've finally reached the second-deepest level of integration with the ecosystem possible (short of actually contributing to Eth1/Eth2 core code... maybe I'll get there one of these days too!)\n\nBut beyond what it means for myself, it has definitely made me think more about the endgame for the network as a whole. Being able to solo validate is, globally speaking, an extremely privileged thing to be able to do. I'm sure this sub has a very high concentration of us (probably second only to r/ethstaker haha) and which has probably made it seem easier or more normal than it actually is, or ever will be. The reality is, there is enough ether for one validator for each 2,177 people on Earth today, if every single ether were being staked. That number is only going to get larger after the Merge.\n\nFortunately we have staking pools, allowing even very small amounts of ether to be staked. Less fortunately, the centralized pools like Kraken or Coinbase are ultimately harmful to the decentralization that is essential for Ethereum. Only with decentralized pools such as Rocketpool will we be able to fully realize the dream of every person who owns any ether being able to realize returns from that ownership, while also contributing to the actual decentralization of web3. I consider decentralized pools to be essential Ethereum infrastructure, as a result, not some kind of afterthought. Just like proper rollup-based L2s, they are fundamental to achieving what Ethereum has set out to achieve.\n\nWe might have the most decentralized tech in the world though, and it will still mean nothing if all the ether itself only remains in the hands of the privileged, like us early adopters. If we hoard it to ourselves, or only sell it to pay for our own wealthy lives (and believe me, those to whom you'll be selling it going forward will largely be corporations looking to centralize, not decentralize), we are not contributing to that all-important decentralization of ether itself, but are merely concentrating it in the hands of those likely to abuse it. A tale as old as time.\n\nThe final, missing piece of the puzzle, then, is to get ether into as many deserving hands as possible, and moreover, to not just give it to them to turn around and sell straight back into the hands of the corporations, but to give it to them *to stake* with decentralized pools.\n\nI see a future where Ethereum staking can become a form of UBI, providing passive income to those who are most well situated to use it for good, and are therefore also most likely to be good actors in the Ethereum network itself. It will never replace a true UBI from governments, but the total economic activity flowing through Ethereum in a few decades will still be enough to support many, many such role-model people and organizations.\n\nThe only problem is, how do we get ether into those hands?\n\nI am personally pledging that, as someone running an Eth2 validator, if the staking rewards ever become more than sufficient to ensure a reasonably safe and comfortable future for myself and my close family, I will be donating the remainder of those rewards to deserving charities, educational institutions, and local community members, **on the condition that they stake it with a decentralized staking pool** (and with the technical assistance to help them do so). These \"forever donations\" will provide permanent income to those good actors, will serve to improve the decentralization of Ethereum, and most importantly, will establish Ethereum as a force for good in this world, a \"better money\", not just a newer and higher-tech one. \n\nI hope any of you who are considering long-term staking, whether on your own or as part of a pool, and who stand a chance of earning \"more than you need\", will consider doing something similar.\n\nEthereum has the potential to be **life-changing money** for any of us here, but I hope we can all come together, in whatever ways we can, to ensure that it also lives up to its potential to truly become **world-changing money**.\n\n^^Okay, ^^back ^^to ^^refreshing ^^beaconcha.in ^^lolz","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi there, fellow Ethfinanciers!
