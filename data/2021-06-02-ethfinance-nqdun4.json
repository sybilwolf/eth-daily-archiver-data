It was in response to a question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/nq3u5q/whats_up_with_all_the_hate_posts_on/h0d5auc/) that asked me \"what will it take for you to admit you are wrong\" about Cardano.\n\nI thought my response might be of interest to ethfinance, and the daily here is a pretty convenient home for the comment where I know it won't be removed by automod, so here are my personal thoughts on why I don't believe Cardano is currently a good long-term investment:\n\n> That's a great question. Here is what would need to change about Cardano for me to become comfortable with it as an investment, in no particular order:\n> \n> * Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about the limitations of Cardano's EUTxO model, which I asked about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/) in April, and which SandaeSwap [wrote about in their whitepaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nqdun4/daily_general_discussion_june_2_2021/h0a4g8t/).\n> \n> * Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about Cardano's fee model under full L1 load, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/gvvnjjx/) and in countless other threads I've commented in.\n> \n> * Me getting straight, understandable answers to why native tokens are functionally superior to Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens. Everything I have read about it is either hand-wavey, or talks about how it's hard and error-prone for developers to copy-paste the ERC-20 templates (bs), or talks about how Cardano's token transfers don't cost any more than its native transfers (which doesn't matter if ALL types of transfers are very cheap.)\n> \n> * Seeing Cardano adopt a scaling solution with better data availability guarantees than Hydra, which requires all interested parties to be online and active in order to arbitrate, similar to Lightening Network's \"watch towers\". Zk and optimistic rollups are one idea (like Ethereum), on-chain execution sharding is another (like Polkadot), data sharding with some extra transaction ordering guarantees are another (like Solana), a native zero-knowledge L1 is another (like Mina). Cardano is pursuing none of those avenues publicly, instead sticking with their outdated 2015 state channel tech.\n> \n> * Significant amounts of liquidity migrating to Cardano. Whales who are liquidity farming on Ethereum just don't have an incentive to fragment their liquidity by moving to Cardano. It's a chicken and egg. I'll keep my eyes open for some clever tokenomics solution, but I don't have my fingers crossed.\n> \n> * Significant amounts of *grassroots* projects migrating to Cardano. It doesn't matter how *many* projects, the only thing that matters is the big players. When Uniswap, MakerDAO, or Compound - or other companies that similarly command billions of dollars of volume and TVL - migrate to Cardano, I'll start taking a second look.\n> \n> * IOHK starting to be more forthcoming about the limitations of their technology. As I mentioned before, the always-online requirement of Hydra. The concentration of stake into multiple pools owned by the same owner (e.g. dozens of binance pools). The compromises an AMM DEX has to make to run under the EUTxO model. Being straightforward that the \"ERC-20 Converter\" does NOT do any \"conversion\" whatsoever, it's a BRIDGE, and rename it \"ERC-20 Bridge\" so that it's clear it is the same thing that a bunch of other chains have.\n> \n> * Smart money starting to take Cardano seriously. ADA had its big day in the sun when it entered the top 10 in 2017, but it's still nowhere on the radar of institutions, silicon valley, or VC-backed startups compared to Ethereum.

Cardano's future multi-language smart contract support gets compared to Ethereum's current Solidity-only support (which isn't even true, since Ethereum supports Vyper too.)

ADA is by far the most frothy crypto in the top 5. Even though it's not launched yet, all of its potential future growth is already priced in for some reason.

It was in response to a question <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/nq3u5q/whats_up_with_all_the_hate_posts_on/h0d5auc/\">here</a> that asked me &quot;what will it take for you to admit you are wrong&quot; about Cardano.</p>\n\n<p>I thought my response might be of interest to ethfinance, and the daily here is a pretty convenient home for the comment where I know it won&#39;t be removed by automod, so here are my personal thoughts on why I don&#39;t believe Cardano is currently a good long-term investment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&#39;s a great question. Here is what would need to change about Cardano for me to become comfortable with it as an investment, in no particular order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I&#39;ve been asking about the limitations of Cardano&#39;s EUTxO model, which I asked about <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/\">here</a> in April, and which SandaeSwap <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nqdun4/daily_general_discussion_june_2_2021/h0a4g8t/\">wrote about in their whitepaper</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I&#39;ve been asking about Cardano&#39;s fee model under full L1 load, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/gvvnjjx/\">see here</a> and in countless other threads I&#39;ve commented in.</p></li>\n<li><p>Me getting straight, understandable answers to why native tokens are functionally superior to Ethereum&#39;s ERC-20 tokens. Everything I have read about it is either hand-wavey, or talks about how it&#39;s hard and error-prone for developers to copy-paste the ERC-20 templates (bs), or talks about how Cardano&#39;s token transfers don&#39;t cost any more than its native transfers (which doesn&#39;t matter if ALL types of transfers are very cheap.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Seeing Cardano adopt a scaling solution with better data availability guarantees than Hydra, which requires all interested parties to be online and active in order to arbitrate, similar to Lightening Network&#39;s &quot;watch towers&quot;. Zk and optimistic rollups are one idea (like Ethereum), on-chain execution sharding is another (like Polkadot), data sharding with some extra transaction ordering guarantees are another (like Solana), a native zero-knowledge L1 is another (like Mina). Cardano is pursuing none of those avenues publicly, instead sticking with their outdated 2015 state channel tech.</p></li>\n<li><p>Significant amounts of liquidity migrating to Cardano. Whales who are liquidity farming on Ethereum just don&#39;t have an incentive to fragment their liquidity by moving to Cardano. It&#39;s a chicken and egg. I&#39;ll keep my eyes open for some clever tokenomics solution, but I don&#39;t have my fingers crossed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Significant amounts of <em>grassroots</em> projects migrating to Cardano. It doesn&#39;t matter how <em>many</em> projects, the only thing that matters is the big players. When Uniswap, MakerDAO, or Compound - or other companies that similarly command billions of dollars of volume and TVL - migrate to Cardano, I&#39;ll start taking a second look.</p></li>\n<li><p>IOHK starting to be more forthcoming about the limitations of their technology. As I mentioned before, the always-online requirement of Hydra. The concentration of stake into multiple pools owned by the same owner (e.g. dozens of binance pools). The compromises an AMM DEX has to make to run under the EUTxO model. Being straightforward that the &quot;ERC-20 Converter&quot; does NOT do any &quot;conversion&quot; whatsoever, it&#39;s a BRIDGE, and rename it &quot;ERC-20 Bridge&quot; so that it&#39;s clear it is the same thing that a bunch of other chains have.</p></li>\n<li><p>Smart money starting to take Cardano seriously. ADA had its big day in the sun when it entered the top 10 in 2017, but it&#39;s still nowhere on the radar of institutions, silicon valley, or VC-backed startups compared to Ethereum. Cardano is designed for and marketed to retail investors, not institutions or developers, and the lack of real institutional interest compared to Ethereum shows this very clearly.</p></li>\n<li><p>A Web3/Metamask-like way to interact with smart contracts through web interfaces via a browser extension and mobile app. This is critical for users to be able to use smart contracts, otherwise Cardano is going to go through some miserable days like Ethereum went through in 2016-2017, when you had to manually invoke functions on smart contracts through MyEtherWallet to get anything done.

One important donation was his \u201cAKITA\u201d tokens to Gitcoin, worth around $450m at the time of his donation. Now, governance is discussing and voting on what to do with the tokens. As of now, the vote is favoring Proposal 1, which aims to (1) sell 10% of the tokens, and then (2) lock and stream the remaining tokens back to governance over the course of 2 years. The preference for this option seems to be trying to strike a balance between actually benefiting the open source/Gitcoin/public good ecosystem today, while also allowing the AKITA community to grow (there have been several posts of people from the AKITA community pleading for Gitcoin governance not to take some of the more extreme measures, like selling all of the tokens, which is the second most popular choice right now, though is lagging by 600k votes). Personally, I don\u2019t necessarily agree with locking the tokens for 2 years, because this is a brand new project/community, because 2 years is a long time (the project may wither away over the course of the next 6 months, making the tokens effectively worthless by the time all of the tokens unlock), but out of all current options, IMO it is the best option and it strikes the best of both worlds by solving Gitcoin\u2019s dilemma w/r/t the AKITA community, while also allowing Gitcoin\u2019s treasury to increase by tens of millions in the short term.

That being said, there hasn\u2019t been nearly enough building to compensate for the demand and as such pre-standing homes in good-enough shape are worth a lot, figuratively and literally. There isn\u2019t going to be a \u201cpop\u201d in pricing, people without the money to play the game will simply be priced out for good.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-02 16:40:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h0dklbq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nqdun4","parent_id":"t1_h0djo5e","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/oldskool47","body":"10","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>10</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-02 16:18:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h0dhsqa","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nqdun4","parent_id":"t1_h0desg9","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Not_Selling_Eth","body":"Certainly me the last five years.\n\nBut this time I see what it's truly like when everyone and their grandma is ~~playing~~ ~~investing~~ gambling.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Certainly me the last five years.</p>\n\n<p>But this time I see what it&#39;s truly like when everyone and their grandma is <del>playing</del> <del>investing</del> gambling.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-02 15:58:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h0dfdic","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nqdun4","parent_id":"t1_h0desg9","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"Certainly reminiscent of the tech bubble, but ease of trading has increased tremendously since then so it's not quite a fair comparison.\n\nAlso world events have lead to a lack of places for the rich to park their money, enter the K Shaped recovery... oof.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Certainly reminiscent of the tech bubble, but ease of trading has increased tremendously since then so it&#39;s not quite a fair comparison.</p>\n\n<p>Also world events have lead to a lack of places for the rich to park their money, enter the K Shaped recovery... oof.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-02 16:00:34","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-06-02 16:07:42","id":"h0dfotd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nqdun4","parent_id":"t1_h0dfdic","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/SexyBorisJohnson","body":"Not so sure.
