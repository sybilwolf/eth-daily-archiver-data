I don&#39;t disagree with the notion of crypto as a vehicle for speculation, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m following you on the second paragraph.</p>\n\n<p>The ability to generate yield on DeFi strikes me as one of the most important benefits of crypto.  It&#39;s a self-custodial, higher-efficiency-than-TradFi market.  It&#39;s not risk-free, in my OPINION*, risk-adjusted yields on stablecoins are far superior to any non-crypto. </p>\n\n<p>(I say OPINION because we all have to make our own risk calculation on it, but TradFi yield is basically nonexistent.)</p>\n\n<p>As for NFT speculation, yes, the market is insane.  But the market is the market.  What the NFT ecosystem REALLY does is provide new modalities and a new vehicle for artists.  Again, it&#39;s a great system compared to traditional systems.  The market will likely continue to find its way...but as a use case for crypto, I really love the NFT ecosystem.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-12 06:54:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1ikwe2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nxz0au","parent_id":"t1_h1ijljg","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/tutamtumikia","body":"I totally agree that decentralized finance and the disintermediation of finance is a great thing.

Initially all data that&#39;s blockchain related is retrieved through an RPC away from anything the user provides. Once a user decides to interact with the platform, they can then choose to connect their wallet and that&#39;s where the provider is replaced with their injected connection.</p>\n\n<p>The only part I don&#39;t believe is the case here is <em>&quot;Frontends shouldn&#39;t need a network change for anything before a transaction anyway&quot;</em>. The project I&#39;m working on is being deployed onto Polygon, so once a user has connected they&#39;ll need to switch their network to Polygon. But I handle this in the most unintrusive way I can. A message bar at the base of the page alerts them they&#39;re on the wrong network and provides them a button to press for MetaMask to prompt the switch, rather than them having to do it manually.</p>\n\n<p>A big part of this project I&#39;ve enjoyed working on, is trying to make the whole connection process as smooth and bug free as possible. A lot of dapps do breach that &quot;annoyance&quot; barrier, and I&#39;m hoping to resolve these the best I can in my own project.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-12 08:01:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h1is9wm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nxz0au","parent_id":"t1_h1iq5fk","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"Your design patterns are everything I want.
