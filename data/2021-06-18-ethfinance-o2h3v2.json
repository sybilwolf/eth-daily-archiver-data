And now, science is hopping on the bandwagon for these receipts of ownership of digital files that are bought and sold online.  \nOn 8 June, the University of California, Berkeley, auctioned off an NFT based on documents relating to the work of Nobel-prizewinning cancer researcher James Allison for more than US$50,000. On 17 June, the US Space Force \u2014 a branch of the US Armed Forces \u2014 started selling a series of NFTs featuring augmented-reality images of satellites and space iconography.  \nAnd, from 23 to 30 June, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, is auctioning an NFT featuring the source code of the original web browser, along with a silent video of the code being typed out.  \nMeanwhile, biology pioneer George Church and a company he co-founded, Nebula Genomics in San Francisco, California, have advertised their intention to sell an NFT of Church\u2019s genome. Church, a geneticist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who helped to launch the Human Genome Project, is well known for controversial proposals, including resurrecting the woolly mammoth and creating a dating app based on DNA.\n\nThe fad for NFTs has been celebrated online for elevating digital art \u2014 and simultaneously derided as meaningless and for having a huge carbon footprint because of the massive computing power required to sustain it.\r  \n\r  \nThe arguments over NFTs in science are similarly heated, with some saying they provide an incentive to showcase science to the public; a new method of fundraising; and even a way for people to earn royalties when pharmaceutical companies buy access to their genomic data. Others say that NFTs \u2014 which operate in a similar way to digital cryptocurrencies \u2014 are just needless energy pouring into a market bubble that\u2019s sure to burst.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe more you look at it, the more you realize how bonkers it is,\u201d says Nicholas Weaver, who studies cryptocurrency at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley.\r  \n\r  \nNFT bubble\r  \nNFTs use the blockchain technology that underlies cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to certify ownership of a file. NFTs are \u2018minted\u2019 in the same way as cryptocurrency \u2014 using one of many online platforms to add them to a tamper-proof blockchain ledger, typically at a cost of tens or hundreds of dollars \u2014 and then sold online. People can buy and trade these certificates in the same way as physical collectibles, such as baseball cards. The art or data can be freely viewed online and downloaded in their original form; the NFT buyer simply has a verifiable receipt of ownership.\r  \n\r  \nThe NFT concept was born in the early 2010s but exploded this year: in March, for example, an NFT for a digital artwork by a US artist nicknamed Beeple sold for nearly $70 million. The NFT market hit a 30-day sales record of $325 billion in early May. In June, it cooled significantly, but it is still seeing more than $10 million in sales per week.\n\nMichael Alvarez Cohen, director of innovation ecosystem development in the intellectual-property office at the University of California, Berkeley, decided to try to use NFTs to raise funds for the university. A team of designers scanned legal papers filed with the university, along with handwritten notes and faxes relating to Allison\u2019s valuable discoveries. This artwork, called The Fourth Pillar, is available for all to see online, and the team minted an NFT for ownership of the work.\r  \n\r  \nAfter a short bidding war, the NFT sold on 8 June for 22 ether (around US$54,000). The buyer was a Berkeley alumni group called FiatLux DAO, founded days before by the same blockchain experts who had advised Berkeley on how to create the NFT in the first place. The money will be split between NFT auction site Foundation, a Berkeley research fund and carbon offsets.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting combination of showing the world these historic documents, and also creating art and sponsoring research and education,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a beautiful circle.\u201d\n\nBut others counter that selling NFTs is a waste, because blockchains rely on energy-hungry computational crunching to prevent data corruption. Digital-currency operator Ethereum, for example, currently has about the same energy usage as the whole of Zimbabwe.\r  \n\r  \nThat makes NFTs \u201creally a criminal amount of waste for something that doesn\u2019t do anything valuable other than act as a database for receipts for ugly cats\u201d, says Weaver. Auctioning off the physical papers would make more sense, he says.\r  \n\r  \nGenome gold rush\r  \nThe Berkeley team is also creating a digital artwork from documents relating to Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, one of the pioneers of CRISPR gene-editing, for a future NFT auction. That is being slowed by the need to make sure that her patent \u2014 which is still active \u2014 isn\u2019t infringed by the art.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, on 10 June, Church and Nebula Genomics put up for sale 20 NFTs, each featuring an artwork based on Church\u2019s likeness and a special, limited edition discount on Nebula\u2019s whole-genome sequencing service. Money raised will be split between an unnamed charity, Church, blockchain company Oasis Labs, Nebula Genomics and the sales platform AkoinNFT.\r  \n\r  \nThat offering is a surprising step back from what was originally advertised: the group said it would be selling an NFT including Church\u2019s genome in a 10 June auction. But that plan was put on the back burner at the last minute, Nebula Genomics told Nature, \u201cbecause the NFT and crypto markets have declined over the past week\u201d.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOur plan is to continue to wait for market conditions to improve before launching the entire auction,\u201d says Nebula co-founder Kamal Obbad. It is unclear when that might be.\r  \n\r  \nThe idea of selling an NFT of Church\u2019s genome had provoked both excitement and bemusement online. As one scientist joked on Twitter, given that Church\u2019s genome has long been freely available online: \u201cBy a weird coincidence, I'm also selling George Church's genome! No auction or NFT or anything though,\u201d they quipped, offering to send the link in exchange for $5.\r  \n\r  \nEthical issues  \nBut for Church\u2019s company, this NFT has a more serious purpose: a trial run. Nebula Genomics already uses blockchain technology to allow 15,000 people whose entire genomes it has sequenced to grant temporary access to their data to specific users (such as pharmaceutical companies searching for links between genes and diseases). NFTs could in future provide a handy system to let customers make money from those exchanges, says Obbad.  \nA few other companies are similarly experimenting with ways for customers to sell genomic data on blockchain marketplaces. The idea is to give users more control of their data and to direct profits straight to the individuals, thereby encouraging more people to get their genomes sequenced.\n\nBut some note that these goals can be achieved without NFTs. The plan to auction an NFT for Church\u2019s genome \u201cis a PR stunt\u201d, says Yaniv Erlich, a computer scientist at Columbia University in New York City and chief science officer of MyHeritage, a genome-sequencing and genealogy company based in Or Yehuda, Israel.\r  \n\r  \nSelling personal genomes opens up ethical issues, says bioethicist Vardit Ravitsky at the University of Montreal in Canada, such as whether any individual truly owns their genome, given that much of it is shared with family members. She also notes there are already debates about whether people should be allowed to make money from their biological resources, for example through sperm donation. The problem of selling data, she says, \u201cwill be the next generation of these issues\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nThere are plenty of \u201copen questions\u201d, agrees Obbad, who says that the proposal to sell an NFT featuring Church's genome had been \u201ca good conversation starter\u201d.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum in the lead story on <a href=\"https://Nature.com\">Nature.com</a>.

Digital-currency operator Ethereum, for example, currently has about the same energy usage as the whole of Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n<p>That makes NFTs \u201creally a criminal amount of waste for something that doesn\u2019t do anything valuable other than act as a database for receipts for ugly cats\u201d, says Weaver. Auctioning off the physical papers would make more sense, he says.</p>\n\n<p>Genome gold rush</p>\n\n<p>The Berkeley team is also creating a digital artwork from documents relating to Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, one of the pioneers of CRISPR gene-editing, for a future NFT auction. That is being slowed by the need to make sure that her patent \u2014 which is still active \u2014 isn\u2019t infringed by the art.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, on 10 June, Church and Nebula Genomics put up for sale 20 NFTs, each featuring an artwork based on Church\u2019s likeness and a special, limited edition discount on Nebula\u2019s whole-genome sequencing service. Money raised will be split between an unnamed charity, Church, blockchain company Oasis Labs, Nebula Genomics and the sales platform AkoinNFT.</p>\n\n<p>That offering is a surprising step back from what was originally advertised: the group said it would be selling an NFT including Church\u2019s genome in a 10 June auction. But that plan was put on the back burner at the last minute, Nebula Genomics told Nature, \u201cbecause the NFT and crypto markets have declined over the past week\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur plan is to continue to wait for market conditions to improve before launching the entire auction,\u201d says Nebula co-founder Kamal Obbad. It is unclear when that might be.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of selling an NFT of Church\u2019s genome had provoked both excitement and bemusement online. As one scientist joked on Twitter, given that Church\u2019s genome has long been freely available online: \u201cBy a weird coincidence, I&#39;m also selling George Church&#39;s genome! No auction or NFT or anything though,\u201d they quipped, offering to send the link in exchange for $5.</p>\n\n<p>Ethical issues<br/>\nBut for Church\u2019s company, this NFT has a more serious purpose: a trial run. Nebula Genomics already uses blockchain technology to allow 15,000 people whose entire genomes it has sequenced to grant temporary access to their data to specific users (such as pharmaceutical companies searching for links between genes and diseases). NFTs could in future provide a handy system to let customers make money from those exchanges, says Obbad.<br/>\nA few other companies are similarly experimenting with ways for customers to sell genomic data on blockchain marketplaces. The idea is to give users more control of their data and to direct profits straight to the individuals, thereby encouraging more people to get their genomes sequenced.</p>\n\n<p>But some note that these goals can be achieved without NFTs. The plan to auction an NFT for Church\u2019s genome \u201cis a PR stunt\u201d, says Yaniv Erlich, a computer scientist at Columbia University in New York City and chief science officer of MyHeritage, a genome-sequencing and genealogy company based in Or Yehuda, Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Selling personal genomes opens up ethical issues, says bioethicist Vardit Ravitsky at the University of Montreal in Canada, such as whether any individual truly owns their genome, given that much of it is shared with family members. She also notes there are already debates about whether people should be allowed to make money from their biological resources, for example through sperm donation. The problem of selling data, she says, \u201cwill be the next generation of these issues\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of \u201copen questions\u201d, agrees Obbad, who says that the proposal to sell an NFT featuring Church&#39;s genome had been \u201ca good conversation starter\u201d.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-18 10:20:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h28by6q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o2h3v2","parent_id":"t3_o2h3v2","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"George Church is such a fuckin gangster.

People saying that it's a bad idea are getting downvoted.\n\nAll I can think about is (A), electronic voting for elections - even blockchain voting - is a bad idea, like a really really bad idea, and (B) cryptocurrency enthusiasts seem to be naive, ignorant, and blind to the risks.\n\nHere's a copy of the comment I posted, responding to someone who asked why paper voting is more secure than blockchain voting. I thought ethfinance might find my thoughts on this interesting, which is why I am re-posting it here.\n\n> With paper, fraud is localized because it's impossible for an attacker to physically coordinate across hundreds or thousands of polling locations. With a blockchain, if there's an issue, it's possible it could affect the whole system and have a chance of affecting the election's integrity.\n\n> More reasons:\n> \n> * Digital voting is a government bid type thing. After we get used to voting using a secure system, some other private company could come in with a lower bid and replace it with a system that can be compromised on a wide scale in a way that the general public won't understand. It could be something as simple as using an outdated hashing algorithm, or as insidious as writing underhanded code that purposely introduces vulnerabilities in a way that is very difficult to audit (if the software is even open source in the first place, which historically it has not been, at least in the case of voting machines). The general public doesn't understand open source or know how to rally or canvas support for it in voting.\n> \n> * There are problems that don't have perfect solutions, like digital ID. With paper elections, ID theft likely means maybe a few dozen fraudulent votes at most (say an employee steals the ID of a bunch of nursing home residents), at a single polling location.

What are your thoughts?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In the other subreddit, they&#39;re discussing how Wyoming may be using a blockchain voting system for their republican/democrat primaries. People saying that it&#39;s a bad idea are getting downvoted.</p>\n\n<p>All I can think about is (A), electronic voting for elections - even blockchain voting - is a bad idea, like a really really bad idea, and (B) cryptocurrency enthusiasts seem to be naive, ignorant, and blind to the risks.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a copy of the comment I posted, responding to someone who asked why paper voting is more secure than blockchain voting. I thought ethfinance might find my thoughts on this interesting, which is why I am re-posting it here.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>With paper, fraud is localized because it&#39;s impossible for an attacker to physically coordinate across hundreds or thousands of polling locations. With a blockchain, if there&#39;s an issue, it&#39;s possible it could affect the whole system and have a chance of affecting the election&#39;s integrity.</p>\n\n<p>More reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Digital voting is a government bid type thing. After we get used to voting using a secure system, some other private company could come in with a lower bid and replace it with a system that can be compromised on a wide scale in a way that the general public won&#39;t understand. It could be something as simple as using an outdated hashing algorithm, or as insidious as writing underhanded code that purposely introduces vulnerabilities in a way that is very difficult to audit (if the software is even open source in the first place, which historically it has not been, at least in the case of voting machines). The general public doesn&#39;t understand open source or know how to rally or canvas support for it in voting.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are problems that don&#39;t have perfect solutions, like digital ID. With paper elections, ID theft likely means maybe a few dozen fraudulent votes at most (say an employee steals the ID of a bunch of nursing home residents), at a single polling location. With a blockchain, it could be possible for someone to steal identity en masse using zero-day exploits on whatever devices people are using to manage their PKI and vote on.</p></li>\n<li><p>In that same vein, we&#39;re inviting more foreign interference with elections, since the system can be attacked remotely. And I don&#39;t mean at the blockchain level, which is not impossible to get right, I mean at the level of IDs and vote messages being stored and sent from potentially insecure devices.</p></li>\n<li><p>Blockchains leave data behind.

This is NOT an *official* ethfinance Pod and not endorsed by any mods of any sort, but is simply created as a hobby project by 2 enthusiasts and users of ethfinance; myself and **sharingnotes#5182** of PoolTogether discord. We are excited to provide a community Pod which has long been an aspiration of many in our community. Its usage and hopefully eventually 'whale status' is now in your hands.\n\n*By rallying around a single Pod, ratio-gang + pod-gang can collectively increase our overall chances to win and defeat the whales*! \ud83d\udc33 \ud83c\udf74\n\n[You can find out more about Pods here](https://docs.pooltogether.com/protocol/pods)\n\n**-** **How it works & benefits of a Pod?**\n\n* \ud83d\udcaa As pod entrants, we get to combine the strength of all our deposits into a sole contract or \u2018Pod\u2019. Many little fish \ud83d\udc1f become a big fish \ud83d\udc0b\n* \ud83e\udd16 The PoolTogether protocol treats this contract as a single \u2018address\u2019 or 'player' within a Pool. If any ticket of the Pod is drawn by the PT protocol, winnings are awarded to the entire Pod and users can claim proportional to their stake within the Pod.\n* \u26fd Gas costs to join a Pod are about \u2153 as expensive as entering a Pool the traditional way. This is because the BATCH command efficiently combines all Pod entrants' deposits into Compound in a single transaction, instead of each user doing the expensive Compound transaction themselves. (See the tutorial linked below for info about BATCH and more)\n\n[The DAI Pool has 3 weekly winners and is drawn at 19:05 UTC Fridays.](https://app.pooltogether.com/pools/mainnet/PT-cDAI) The prize is split to 3 winners. Grand prize + 2 runners up. All winners get 1/3 of the prize pot interest accrued but the Grand prize winner also receives the Loot Box. In the Loot Box is anything from NFTs to farmed tokens from the Yield Source. In this case COMP from Compound. The hope here is that our Pod is one of the 3 winners and ideally the grand prize winner \ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\udd11 The DAI pool currently has +$50 million DAI deposits earning prizes and a +7% APR in POOL drip rewards.\n\n**- How was the Pod contract created and how do i know this is legit?** \\- \ud83e\udd28\n\nThe Pod contract was created by the official PodFactory contract created by the PoolTogether Inc team, so by extension, carries the same contract security as the original Pods. Let me restate that because its the main source of info you need to know I didn't write my own contract to rugpull your funds from a custom contract. **This pod carries** ***identical*** **contract code to the official PoolTogether Pod contracts as it came from the same place. The PodFactory.** You can confirm the contract came from the official [PodFactory contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e3a9f9fbafb2ec49727cffa2a411f7a0c1c4ce1) with [this transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2a7eacfbded2b68876aa2974d06c435f7a28e277e9efb0aa04420776ba0c60a0). This is the very same contract that formed the official USDC and DAI pod contracts for PoolTogether Inc. Note the previous transactions that form the basis of the USDC and DAI pods.\n\n**- What is the official Pod contract address? -**\n\nOur Ethfinance Pod contract is [0x09accc89e3599137c83fb87acb9443a15c4bd268](https://etherscan.io/address/0x09accc89e3599137c83fb87acb9443a15c4bd268)  \n[See the Pod represented as a 'player' in the pool on app.pooltogether](https://app.pooltogether.com/players/0x09accc89e3599137c83fb87acb9443a15c4bd268)\n\nNote the pod contract address is the same as the address in the url of the Player page on app.PoolTogetherI have also requested the PoolTogether Inc devs to give the Pod a unique name for its address in the Players list on PoolTogether. **'\ud83d\udc33** /r/ethfinance **Pod Users'** You can see us in the player list around page 65 or so.\n\n**- What happens if your community made and hosted front-end goes down? - \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude2b**\n\nShould the front-end UI at [ethfinance.win](https://ethfinance.win) ever go down, I have [created a tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fl9wQ64oMMGgV5QgY4qNBqYQH7CSBXyRQmngij9KAJc/edit?usp=sharing) on how to manually interact with the Etherscan pod contract's write interface. This should hopefully never be necessary, but is provided to give you peace of mind that a means to enter & exit the pod is always available via manual contract interaction. The tutorial also contains more info on the inner workings of a Pod so is recommended further reading.\n\nThere is a '[Pod Upkeep](https://ethfinance.win/upkeep/)' page that will allow you to activate any of the permissionless contract interactions too.\n\n\\- **Caveats**\n\nPlease be aware of the following caveats & when depositing to the ethfinance DAI Pod.\n\n* The BATCH command needs to be run to push deposited DAI funds into the DAI Pool. This is a permissionless command and can be run by any user but I will run it myself at least once a week at or around Friday 18:00 UTC. This is approx 1 hour before the DAI Prize Pool is drawn. This will ensure any deposits from the week before will be in the live Pool for the next week but until the BATCH command is run, your DAI deposit wont be live in the Pool yet.\n* As creator of the Pod, I own the private keys for the PodManager. The PodManager CANNOT arbitrarily remove funds from the Pod, but is responsible for special actions such as distributing ERC721's (Think NFTs that cannot be distributed to all pod holders)\n* Should the Pod win any NFTs, the ethfinance community can decide how we distribute. Either by competitions in r/ethfinance or liquidating on opensea. Another idea i had was to liquidate and donate to a gitcoin grant of community choice.\n* The contract tracks all POOL reward APY due to each pDAI token holder, but the DROP command needs to be run first to distribute. Again, this is a permissionless command that any user can run themselves on the contract.\n* There is an internal 'early exit fee' that will be charged on your deposit up to a max of 1% of the original deposit if you withdraw within 10 days, winding down to 0% the closer you get to the exit window. This is to prevent users 'gaming' the prizepool by depositing right before the draw and exiting right after. After the cooldown period has passed, you can safely withdraw your funds without any losses. The [ethfinance.win](https://ethfinance.win) 'withdraw' UI calculates this fee and will display what you will be charged if you attempt to withdraw early.\n* As is the advice with **any** smart contract, use at your own risk and only commit funds you are willing to lose. i.e please dont yolo degen into a lottery game with your life savings.\n\nIf you have any further questions or issues with the Pod or Pod UI, please dont hesitate to get directly in touch with me. I am excited for our Pod and want it to be a roaring success and a non-degen, fun focal point for our community to rally around! \ud83d\ude04","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>- PoolTogether &amp; Ethfinance DAI Pod update -</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Good day</strong> <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a>!</p>\n\n<p>I am announcing the creation and launch of our glorious community driven <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">/r/ethfinance</a> PoolTogether DAI Pod at <a href=\"https://ethfinance.win\">ethfinance.win</a> site! \ud83d\udc1f</p>\n\n<p>This is, according to PoolTogether devs, the first ever community Pod created outside the 2 official PoolTogether Inc DAI and USDC pods. This is NOT an <em>official</em> ethfinance Pod and not endorsed by any mods of any sort, but is simply created as a hobby project by 2 enthusiasts and users of ethfinance; myself and <strong>sharingnotes#5182</strong> of PoolTogether discord. We are excited to provide a community Pod which has long been an aspiration of many in our community. Its usage and hopefully eventually &#39;whale status&#39; is now in your hands.</p>\n\n<p><em>By rallying around a single Pod, ratio-gang + pod-gang can collectively increase our overall chances to win and defeat the whales</em>! \ud83d\udc33 \ud83c\udf74</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.pooltogether.com/protocol/pods\">You can find out more about Pods here</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>How it works &amp; benefits of a Pod?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\ud83d\udcaa As pod entrants, we get to combine the strength of all our deposits into a sole contract or \u2018Pod\u2019. Many little fish \ud83d\udc1f become a big fish \ud83d\udc0b</li>\n<li>\ud83e\udd16 The PoolTogether protocol treats this contract as a single \u2018address\u2019 or &#39;player&#39; within a Pool. If any ticket of the Pod is drawn by the PT protocol, winnings are awarded to the entire Pod and users can claim proportional to their stake within the Pod.</li>\n<li>\u26fd Gas costs to join a Pod are about \u2153 as expensive as entering a Pool the traditional way. This is because the BATCH command efficiently combines all Pod entrants&#39; deposits into Compound in a single transaction, instead of each user doing the expensive Compound transaction themselves. (See the tutorial linked below for info about BATCH and more)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://app.pooltogether.com/pools/mainnet/PT-cDAI\">The DAI Pool has 3 weekly winners and is drawn at 19:05 UTC Fridays.</a> The prize is split to 3 winners. Grand prize + 2 runners up. All winners get 1/3 of the prize pot interest accrued but the Grand prize winner also receives the Loot Box. In the Loot Box is anything from NFTs to farmed tokens from the Yield Source. In this case COMP from Compound. The hope here is that our Pod is one of the 3 winners and ideally the grand prize winner \ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\udd11 The DAI pool currently has +$50 million DAI deposits earning prizes and a +7% APR in POOL drip rewards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- How was the Pod contract created and how do i know this is legit?</strong> - \ud83e\udd28</p>\n\n<p>The Pod contract was created by the official PodFactory contract created by the PoolTogether Inc team, so by extension, carries the same contract security as the original Pods. Let me restate that because its the main source of info you need to know I didn&#39;t write my own contract to rugpull your funds from a custom contract. <strong>This pod carries</strong> <strong><em>identical</em></strong> <strong>contract code to the official PoolTogether Pod contracts as it came from the same place. The PodFactory.</strong> You can confirm the contract came from the official <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e3a9f9fbafb2ec49727cffa2a411f7a0c1c4ce1\">PodFactory contract</a> with <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2a7eacfbded2b68876aa2974d06c435f7a28e277e9efb0aa04420776ba0c60a0\">this transaction</a>.
