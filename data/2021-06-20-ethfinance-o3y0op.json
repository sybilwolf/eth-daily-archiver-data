He is a control freak and gets upset when we do not tell him how much money we have in crypto when he repeatedly asked. He knows almost nothing about crypto but has the typical negative connotations embedded in his current perception. We have been firm saying we\u2019re happy to talk about both the range of houses we are looking at and the technology of crypto, particularly ETH, but we are not going to talk investment numbers. \n\nThis weekend we got to have a 15min uninterrupted chat about it, which is by far the longest ever on this whole topic. Over breakfast he initially asked how the \u2018house stuff\u2019 was going to which I said both tradfi and crypto savings were going to plan, which they are. He asked about risks of losing what we have, so I reiterated that we have a fair amount of \u00a3 tradfi savings and some $ in stablecoins (which required a quick explanation in contrast to BTC). This was the extent of the talk about money and no \u2018how much\u2019 requests, happy days! \n\nHe then asked about BTC energy usage, the typical \u2018so why does BTC use as much energy as Denmark?\u2019. He then let me spend 5 mins giving an overview of BTC\u2019s POW and how ETH is transitioning to POS and what that means for both energy usage and the assets. Although nodding along and certainly hearing the words I was saying, I don\u2019t expect that he understood much of it. After my spiel he turned to my partner and said \u2018so can you explain all of that too?\u2019 in a jokey manner which is his standard way of avoiding the content of a discussion.

He is a control freak and gets upset when we do not tell him how much money we have in crypto when he repeatedly asked. He knows almost nothing about crypto but has the typical negative connotations embedded in his current perception. We have been firm saying we\u2019re happy to talk about both the range of houses we are looking at and the technology of crypto, particularly ETH, but we are not going to talk investment numbers. </p>\n\n<p>This weekend we got to have a 15min uninterrupted chat about it, which is by far the longest ever on this whole topic. Over breakfast he initially asked how the \u2018house stuff\u2019 was going to which I said both tradfi and crypto savings were going to plan, which they are. He asked about risks of losing what we have, so I reiterated that we have a fair amount of \u00a3 tradfi savings and some $ in stablecoins (which required a quick explanation in contrast to BTC). This was the extent of the talk about money and no \u2018how much\u2019 requests, happy days! </p>\n\n<p>He then asked about BTC energy usage, the typical \u2018so why does BTC use as much energy as Denmark?\u2019. He then let me spend 5 mins giving an overview of BTC\u2019s POW and how ETH is transitioning to POS and what that means for both energy usage and the assets. Although nodding along and certainly hearing the words I was saying, I don\u2019t expect that he understood much of it. After my spiel he turned to my partner and said \u2018so can you explain all of that too?\u2019 in a jokey manner which is his standard way of avoiding the content of a discussion. The main win here is that he got the impression that I know what I\u2019m talking about and I understand the technology. </p>\n\n<p>I also mentioned the email that I sent him in May 2017 about distributed ledger technology in general and links to the best impartial info at that time.

You only need bitcoin for investing.&quot;</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 01:28:29","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-06-20 01:32:43","id":"h2erk1q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t3_o3y0op","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"They\u2019re actually mentally challenged, this type of nonsense is what made me dump 99% of my Bitcoin into Eth years ago.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>They\u2019re actually mentally challenged, this type of nonsense is what made me dump 99% of my Bitcoin into Eth years ago.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 01:34:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2erw6a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t1_h2erk1q","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"Yeah right premined 72 million coins and somehow Vitalik ends up owning 300,000 coins today or 0.3% of the total supply.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yeah right premined 72 million coins and somehow Vitalik ends up owning 300,000 coins today or 0.3% of the total supply.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 01:40:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2esadk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t1_h2erw6a","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Plenix","body":"I like how they also talk about a non-profit organization as \u201dbuddies\u201d.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I like how they also talk about a non-profit organization as \u201dbuddies\u201d.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 02:53:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2ewlqn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t1_h2esadk","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"The \"premine\" thing was among the first (and for a long time favoured) sticks used by Bitcoin maximalists to attempt to beat down the innovation occurring with Ethereum.

For this raffle, there are 4 eligible POAPs and I held 2, entered the raffle with those 2, then acquired a 3rd eligible POAP and want to add that new POAP as an additional raffle entry. But the &quot;Join Raffle&quot; button is disabled since I already joined with 2 of my 3 eligible/held POAPs. Basically I need to leave the raffle and rejoin with all 3 entries, but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a mechanism to remove my existing 2 entries from the raffle.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 10:17:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2g3let","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t1_h2fmrzu","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/trent_vanepps","body":"hmm, I haven't experienced this myself - looks like it's already been forwarded to the POAP team, lets see what they say","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>hmm, I haven&#39;t experienced this myself - looks like it&#39;s already been forwarded to the POAP team, lets see what they say</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-21 06:36:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2j9xuv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t1_h2f43o8","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/RestStopRumble","body":"Can you imagine if the feds came rushing into prop up crypto like they do with stocks?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Can you imagine if the feds came rushing into prop up crypto like they do with stocks?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 08:57:23","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-06-20 09:16:18","id":"h2ftrxc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t3_o3y0op","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Instead we just wait for Coinbase to go offline during high volume periods.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Instead we just wait for Coinbase to go offline during high volume periods.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 09:34:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2fy7k7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t1_h2ftrxc","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Mkkoll","body":"Circuit breaker on Ethereum mainnet...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Circuit breaker on Ethereum mainnet...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 09:14:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2fvu5v","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t1_h2ftrxc","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Picked up a few ETH at $2177 on the move up.

Obviously there are whales who would laugh at anything we have to say.  So I think you\u2019re right, though I honestly think there\u2019s an inverse relationship between how much you\u2019re working with and how much you care as well...no matter how much I lost, I\u2019m never going to worry about paying the bills at the end of the day, and that\u2019s an existential difference between people of different sized wallets.  Particularly when so much of successful trading or even holding depends on making dispassionate or even counterintuitive choices...I\u2019ve learned to buy against fear at times exactly like this, and that\u2019s just not something I could really do until it all became surplus capital instead of money I might need to keep the lights on.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 22:02:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2i9a5c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3y0op","parent_id":"t1_h2i7822","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/TotesMessenger","body":"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.
