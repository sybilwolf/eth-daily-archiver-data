Here is my background which may color my bias.\n\nI ascribe to the notion that Eth will change the world and likely already has.  I do not have much doubt that Eth will eventually hit $10k.  I think $20k will eventually be fair value further in the future.  I recently sold all of my crypto except for what is being staked and I also have a short against that staked Eth as a hedge.  I do think the market is most likely either going to go sideways or much further down.  I just recently finished building a short position on equities (especially the NASDAQ).  I have been shorting the crypto bounces.  Discussed [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/no3vom/daily_general_discussion_may_30_2021/h00xgxa/), then [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nwfi05/daily_general_discussion_june_10_2021/h1cvaki/)/[here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nwfi05/daily_general_discussion_june_10_2021/h1cy38g/), and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/o2h3v2/daily_general_discussion_june_18_2021/h28ubi8/).\n\nSome random thoughts:\n\n-If you are experienced in this market, do not trade and only accumulate, or can stomach massive drawdowns and cold exhausting winters then you can ignore my posts or treat them as entertainment.  It is incredibly pivotal to asses this in a sober minded fashion.  Very few people fit this description.  \n\n-My best advice in the current market is don't trade.  You are currently trading against large teams/desks with extensive expertise in siphoning retail trader money.  Everything will look like it is about to break out and it will suddenly reverse.  Everything will look like it is going to crash to zero and then suddenly reverse.\n\n-Above all DO NOT USE LEVERAGE in this environment.  The odds you are fighting against are worse than a slot machine.\n\n-Your alts that are down 60% can easily go down another 60%.  Alts in this current market are essentially illiquid leveraged Eth or BTC positions.  Fundamentals wont matter.  Every coin is claiming to save the world.\n\n-While I think the exuberant \"hopium\" posts are often well intentioned, I think they can be dangerous especially after we have done a 45x in one year and have had an influx of new inexperienced people.  I recognize some names who were wailing and gnashing their teeth holding from 1400 to 90 who are now spewing verbal diarrhea. \n\n-I don't think it is mentally and fiscally wise to just shrug your shoulders and take an +80% loss.  You are taking a risk on an early/emerging asset class and deserve to be wealthy for being right.  Being right but still not being financially rewarded is a terrible outcome.\n\n-Have a plan.  If your plan is to say blindly DCA until $10k then do that in a structured and controlled manner.  Don't react to the charts.  If the price is effecting your emotional state or you are spending hours looking at the charts then you are not following the plan.  Your plan needs to change.\n\n-Eth's price is still almost entirely driven by speculation.  Throughout Eth's history, virtually every event has been a \"sell the news\" situation.  If the market is up trending then the price will go up leading to the major milestone and not uniquely after.  Fundamental milestone events do not overcome the trend.  Currently I think the launch of EIP1559 will be a sell the news event.  Any delay will doubly negatively influence the price.  I think the Eth merge is a sell the news event.  Any delay will negatively influence the price.  Do not look to these events to save you from reckless losses you may be experiencing or facing.\n\n-I think the inevitable Eth flipping of BTC will be a cataclysmic \"get the hell out of the market\" event.  As in fire sell everything and wait for the flames to die down.\n\n-Regarding \"is the bull run over\" or \"are we in a bear market\".  I get this question a lot.  It depends on how you define these terms.  If you define a bear market as the loss of a continues uptrend and downward price pressure then yes I think we are in a bear market.  If you define it as the potential for large drops (50% followed by another 50%) then yes I think we are in a bear market.  If you define it as Eth going to $90 and grinding the sea floor for months on end then no I don't think that's where we are nor do I think that event happening again is very *likely* (anything is possible).\n\n-Will you buy Eth if it goes down to X price?  I will always accumulate Eth at prices that are grossly discordant from reality, but I will not step in front of a freight train to do so. I am happy to buy when the market starts to show strength even if that is at a higher price.  I can't give you a magic number in advance.  I am not a fortuneteller.  \n\n-The crypto \"up only\" exuberant market structure has been broken for now and the crypto market is now very (disproportionately) sensitive to bad news and negative outside forces. You should pay attention to outside market forces such as the US dollar, metals, and equities.  Crypto is not immune to their impact.  I currently hold that the US dollar is showing signs of strength (despite the inflation narrative) and that equities are showing weakness.  Thus I am currently positioned defensively.  If equities complete a 20% correction (my current anticipation) then crypto will get absolutely crushed further.  This does not mean all hope is lost and we go back to a winter wasteland.  It may however mean Eth goes to 1.4k or even 600 prior to resuming it's uptrend towards 10k (as an example).  If Eth going to 600 will leave you devastated and bitter then you may miss the resumption of the uptrend.  Conversely if equities continue to breakout and enter into further price discovery then crypto will resume the uptrend and we'll get a double bubble.\n\nAgain if you are experienced in this market or do not trade and only accumulate or can stomach massive drawdowns and cold exhausting winters then you can ignore my posts or treat them as entertainment.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all</p>\n\n<p>I had some time this morning so I thought I would answer a few questions I&#39;ve gotten as a post instead of only replying individually in my DM&#39;s.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, everyone has a bias.

I am happy to buy when the market starts to show strength even if that is at a higher price.  I can&#39;t give you a magic number in advance.  I am not a fortuneteller.  </p>\n\n<p>-The crypto &quot;up only&quot; exuberant market structure has been broken for now and the crypto market is now very (disproportionately) sensitive to bad news and negative outside forces. You should pay attention to outside market forces such as the US dollar, metals, and equities.  Crypto is not immune to their impact.  I currently hold that the US dollar is showing signs of strength (despite the inflation narrative) and that equities are showing weakness.  Thus I am currently positioned defensively.  If equities complete a 20% correction (my current anticipation) then crypto will get absolutely crushed further.  This does not mean all hope is lost and we go back to a winter wasteland.  It may however mean Eth goes to 1.4k or even 600 prior to resuming it&#39;s uptrend towards 10k (as an example).  If Eth going to 600 will leave you devastated and bitter then you may miss the resumption of the uptrend.  Conversely if equities continue to breakout and enter into further price discovery then crypto will resume the uptrend and we&#39;ll get a double bubble.</p>\n\n<p>Again if you are experienced in this market or do not trade and only accumulate or can stomach massive drawdowns and cold exhausting winters then you can ignore my posts or treat them as entertainment.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 22:38:58","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-06-20 22:55:36","id":"h2ic1n2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o4nihc","parent_id":"t3_o4nihc","score":127,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Throwawayaskreddi","body":"Phenomenal comment","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Phenomenal comment</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 23:05:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2idwv3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o4nihc","parent_id":"t1_h2ic1n2","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Wondering why you're bearish on equities.\n\nIt seems like the Fed can keep pumping in money.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wondering why you&#39;re bearish on equities.</p>\n\n<p>It seems like the Fed can keep pumping in money.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 23:10:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2ie8w9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o4nihc","parent_id":"t1_h2ic1n2","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Throwawayaskreddi","body":"They\u2019ve started the conversation in earnest about deciding not to","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>They\u2019ve started the conversation in earnest about deciding not to</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 23:34:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2ifvi6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o4nihc","parent_id":"t1_h2ie8w9","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/sayno2mids","body":"Well... now I feel like shit about the short term","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Well... now I feel like shit about the short term</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-20 23:28:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2ifiho","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o4nihc","parent_id":"t1_h2ic1n2","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"That's usually a good time to load up.

Don't try to gamble further with them (I am already guilty of this myself)\n* DCA'ing across this period may be very lucrative long-term. Right now, it feels easy to DCA. It won't if/when the price goes down by a lot, but that is also when it'll be most impactful\n\nI have followed the above advice myself and have enough fiat set aside for taxes and expenses for a few years + a little extra. Other than that, I've kept the vast majority of it in the market. I don't want to lose exposure, and frankly, I don't want to get hit by some insane taxes without a good reason.\n\nAnd long-term, I am still as bullish as ever about ETH and Ethereum. L2 deployments, EIP-1559, and the move to PoS will be incredible catalysts, driving years of value accrual to ETH.

It won&#39;t if/when the price goes down by a lot, but that is also when it&#39;ll be most impactful</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have followed the above advice myself and have enough fiat set aside for taxes and expenses for a few years + a little extra. Other than that, I&#39;ve kept the vast majority of it in the market. I don&#39;t want to lose exposure, and frankly, I don&#39;t want to get hit by some insane taxes without a good reason.</p>\n\n<p>And long-term, I am still as bullish as ever about ETH and Ethereum. L2 deployments, EIP-1559, and the move to PoS will be incredible catalysts, driving years of value accrual to ETH. But in the near-term, the market can be irrational and ignore most or all of these things. But eventually, their time will come.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you all are staying safe and sane. We&#39;ve made it through worse, and we&#39;ll make it through this too. \ud83d\udd96\u270c</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-21 19:03:37","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-06-21 19:17:05","id":"h2lv1cc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o4nihc","parent_id":"t3_o4nihc","score":79,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/niktak11","body":"40% chance of multi-year bear seems way too high to me.

The permisionless aspect of that is how banking and healthcare and other industries will be changed forever. He brought up how crazy it is that Michael Saylor proposed the Bitcoin Mining committee that that is the complete opposite of everything about crypto.

This will entitle a certain project to more of the \u201cpot\u201d of funds that Gitcoin distributes at the end of each round, in addition to the dollar you donate.

You can learn more here (<a href=\"https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;match=1000\">https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;match=1000</a>), but the gist is that a pool of funds held by Gitcoin is distributed to each round\u2019s participants based on how many people and how much money was donated to them versus other participants. This will entitle a certain project to more of the \u201cpot\u201d of funds that Gitcoin distributes at the end of each round, in addition to the dollar you donate. In many ways, you are \u201cvoting\u201d with your money as to which projects you see as most valuable in the space, and each dollar you donate can have much larger economic benefit for the team you donated to. </li>\n<li>  Last, donating to ecosystem projects is important especially when you consider how teams get funded. In the past, there have been grants from the EF or ICOs, but over time, lots of teams simply start something without either. Gitcoin grants are a way to help fund these projects/teams from the idea phase into a working product phase, which can help the entire ecosystem grow (and because of features of Ethereum like composability between smart contracts, one team\u2019s individual success can often lead to many other team\u2019s successes).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-21 21:41:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2maimp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o4nihc","parent_id":"t1_h2knfr2","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Gekonn","body":"I love you and here I was asking for projects :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I love you and here I was asking for projects :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-21 23:15:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2mhw29","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o4nihc","parent_id":"t1_h2maimp","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/decibels42","body":"Sorry I totally misread that.
