Have been here since 2016 and never sold any Eth.  I'm also comfortable with that and even the recent price action.  I don't regret not selling (as I will try to explain below).  I'm also not really a finance guy, so I might be using the term \"taking profits\" incorrectly, but I hope my point is clear even if I'm getting the terminology wrong.  \n\nI've seen a sentiment pop up here a few times that is very natural after a crash like what we have experienced over the last week.  It's the \"I should have sold when it was higher\" feeling of regret that, if you had only sold at $4,000, you would have made a great decision and would have significantly more money than you do now.  That's such an obvious statement, but it is much more complicated than I think most people realize.\n\n \nI'm 100% in favor of someone taking profits *if that is what they are trying to do*.  The issue, I find, is that many people confuse \"taking profits\" with trading.  The way I differentiate the two is that when you take profits, you have decided that you are happy with your return and, if the price continues to go up and never falls back down, you will still be at least satisfied with your decision.  If you are in that camp, that's great.  Congratulations!  For many, that's the entire goal.  \n\nMany, however, are talking about how they should have sold at $4,000 because they could buy back in at the current price.  That's trading, and it is notoriously hard to do.  Of course, if you had sold at $4,000, you would be very happy right now.  But how likely are you to actually time the top?  Of course, even if you sold at $3,000, you would be very happy right now, but would you have actually stayed on the sidelines as something as amazing as ETH just kept rising in price?  \n\nI asked myself how I would have played this if I wasn't a long term holder, and if I am being really honest with myself, I would have sold starting at $2,500 up to probably $3,500, and would have seen no end in sight and would have probably bought back in at $4,000.  For me, \"taking profits\" would have just been trading and I'd have ended up significantly worse off.\n\nSo if you are kicking yourself for not selling, but still believe that ETH, long term, is going to go well above its current ATH, I would encourage you to really be honest with yourself and ask if you would have *actually* made money trading this cycle.  I know I wouldn't have.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>First, I should state that I&#39;m a long term holder.  Have been here since 2016 and never sold any Eth.  I&#39;m also comfortable with that and even the recent price action.  I don&#39;t regret not selling (as I will try to explain below).  I&#39;m also not really a finance guy, so I might be using the term &quot;taking profits&quot; incorrectly, but I hope my point is clear even if I&#39;m getting the terminology wrong.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen a sentiment pop up here a few times that is very natural after a crash like what we have experienced over the last week.  It&#39;s the &quot;I should have sold when it was higher&quot; feeling of regret that, if you had only sold at $4,000, you would have made a great decision and would have significantly more money than you do now.  That&#39;s such an obvious statement, but it is much more complicated than I think most people realize.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m 100% in favor of someone taking profits <em>if that is what they are trying to do</em>.  The issue, I find, is that many people confuse &quot;taking profits&quot; with trading.  The way I differentiate the two is that when you take profits, you have decided that you are happy with your return and, if the price continues to go up and never falls back down, you will still be at least satisfied with your decision.  If you are in that camp, that&#39;s great.  Congratulations!  For many, that&#39;s the entire goal.  </p>\n\n<p>Many, however, are talking about how they should have sold at $4,000 because they could buy back in at the current price.  That&#39;s trading, and it is notoriously hard to do.  Of course, if you had sold at $4,000, you would be very happy right now.  But how likely are you to actually time the top?  Of course, even if you sold at $3,000, you would be very happy right now, but would you have actually stayed on the sidelines as something as amazing as ETH just kept rising in price?  </p>\n\n<p>I asked myself how I would have played this if I wasn&#39;t a long term holder, and if I am being really honest with myself, I would have sold starting at $2,500 up to probably $3,500, and would have seen no end in sight and would have probably bought back in at $4,000.  For me, &quot;taking profits&quot; would have just been trading and I&#39;d have ended up significantly worse off.</p>\n\n<p>So if you are kicking yourself for not selling, but still believe that ETH, long term, is going to go well above its current ATH, I would encourage you to really be honest with yourself and ask if you would have <em>actually</em> made money trading this cycle.  I know I wouldn&#39;t have.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-22 13:33:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2oxt63","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o5eut2","parent_id":"t3_o5eut2","score":67,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-22 13:47:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2ozo7k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o5eut2","parent_id":"t1_h2oxt63","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"People tend to forget that the sell the top and buy the bottom to 2x your stack requires 2 perfect trades in a volatile market.

Here's what I typed up:\n\nLet me provide some context here to try and help you look at what really matters in determining whether we are in a bull or bear market.\n\nPrice is a function of supply and demand. Nothing more. Options expiring are a one off event. That hardly means anything in the bigger picture. The supply and demand equation on a timescale any longer than a day or two remains unchanged. Sure, for a little while, some people will have to cover their positions, resulting in a very temporary increase in the supply of ETH on the open market, but that won't last. The same thing goes for news pieces which make for dramatic headlines such as BTC becoming legal tender or an Elon Musk tweet. Neither of these have any real long term effects on supply and demand. Sure, maybe the odd El Salvadorian will jump into BTC or another institution will jump into crypto seeing that a nation state has now legitimised it, but really it is inconsequential in the bigger picture. All of the noise we see in the markets is primarily a result of algorthmic trading bots responding to key words in Elon's tweets or breaking headlines, further worsened by a snowball effect of panic selling or FOMO from retail investors.\n\nAlright u/Tricky_Troll, what does affect the supply and demand equation significantly then? Well let me ask you a question first and see if you can figure it out! What historical event have the 4 year crypto market cycles historically revolved around without fail?\n\nThat's right. The Bitcoin halving. Well as it turns out, we're still in the supply shock half of the halving cycle. But that's not what my point here is. There's something even bigger around the corner. EIP-1559 and the PoS merge. Ethereum is about to make the halvening look like quantitative easing. With these two upgrades, ETH is going from a 4-5% pa annual inflation rate to a negative net issuance rate. That's $50 million dollars of selling pressure per day removed from the supply side of the supply and demand equation, plus whatever the negative issuance rate becomes. Your puny headlines and one off selling events from options traders don't mean jack shit against this beast. This will be like the Tesla buying Bitcoin headline all day, everyday it's just that significant. You simply cannot have a bear market in these conditions.\n\nAlright, fine. I may have gotten a bit carried away by those last two sentences but I hope you see my point. Far too many people are calling this a bear market without looking at the macro picture. For reference, we fell from $420 to $140 in mid 2017 before blasting off to $1,400 EOY 2017. Based on that, we could drop to $1,400 and still be in a bull market. And believe me, the former all-time-high will be one hell of a support level if we were to touch it. So until we break below $1,400 for longer than just a few hours, I'm not breaking a sweat and we aren't in a bear market yet.\n\n^(Even if we did drop below $1,400 and do enter a bear market the fundamentals are still as strong as ever so you better bet your ass I'd be accumulating like crazy at those levels.)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I was in <a href=\"/r/ETHTrader\">r/ETHTrader</a> earlier today sharing why I think &quot;options expiring&quot; in the next few days does not mean price is going to go down and that we have entered a bear market as some were suggesting.

Call it 70-30 if you like, but I stand by that analysis. I will add that a lot of that probability behind the multi-year bear is due to what I consider to be greater time risk. e.g., if this bearish period has in any way elongated the cycle, things get progressively more risky in a still  volatile macro environment with a stock market which could violently correct at any time\n* Many are making assumptions around near-term fundamental events and how they may reflect in pricing (e.g., EIP-1559). Long-term, I'm *super* bullish on developments like these, but think they may take some time to be priced in. I also believe this could be the case with PoS (which could occur in <12 months). We have seen this multiple times with BTC halvenings, etc., where the diminished supply effect takes some time to price in.\n* I really don't think ETH is going to make a significant move up right now without BTC, no matter how strong its independent fundamentals. This community is often heavily biased towards events like the \"flippening,\" and while I think it'll happen one day, many have irrational expectations around timelines for that. I believe ETH will truly detach in future cycles one day, but BTC still rules liquidity for crypto- period. That said, I'm somewhat optimistic that ETH can maintain 0.04 or higher on the ratio during this time...tbd\n* The true max pain scenario is basically just bottoming out here or lower (let's say 1800 to 800) and just going sideways for several months, leaving many to think the market is dead. Then rage pumping out of nowhere with the bull resuming. This is close to what I think a 6-12 bear might look like\n* There is great value in preparing for the worst, hedging your risk so you can make it without losing your sanity, and then thriving through the best\n\nAll in all, I think a lot of people underestimate the challenge in resuming bullish momentum after a rout like this (i.e., 50%+ decline during a bull). Personally, I'd actually feel way better if we had a mega nuke like March 2020, but we are unlikely to get a catalyst that extreme right now. During that event, basically all sellers exited within a few days. I felt very confident buying after that rektage, because there were literally no sellers left. I can't say I feel that confident right now.\n\nSo this may feel more like 2018 in the sense that it takes more time to sort itself out, as we see more sellers emerge basically out of boredom and progressive lost hope, thinking that \"it's all over\"- not so much because the price is going down, but because it is not going up anymore. That is how bears tend to unwind over time, culminating in a few liquidation events. We've had one of those already, and suspect we'll see another one or maybe two soon.\n\nI think the logic which makes less sense to me is stuff like \"that *couldn't* have been the top because it didn't align perfectly to the four year cycle and we didn't see a blow off top.\" I agree those are points for it not having been \"the top\" and the introduction of a long-term bear, but it's not compelling enough for me to say that it's absolutely not possible. FWIW, I'm not trying to be \"right,\" I'm just trying to consider a range of possibilities and be prepared for them. I have maybe 8x more skin in the game (in crypto-terms) than I did at the top of the 2018 bull market.\n\nIn any event, I could be totally wrong, and we V up tomorrow back into bull, but I seriously doubt it. Now is a time to reflect on your own positioning and adjust it as appropriate. I remain almost entirely allocated and have only taken out enough to cover needs in the event we are entering a multi-year bear (as is prudent for me since I don't have a wage income at the moment).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, shared this write-up here yesterday, but because of time zones, some may not have seen it, so sharing the link here: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/o4nihc/daily_general_discussion_june_21_2021/h2lv1cc/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/o4nihc/daily_general_discussion_june_21_2021/h2lv1cc/</a> </p>\n\n<p>Just a few post-mortem thoughts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of people internalized my commentary on the worst case scenario (multi-year bear) more than the situation which I give higher odds (6-12 month bear) which is interesting.

This can be decided through Kleros governance process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.kleros.io/proof-of-humanity-faq/\">Source</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even then, you need users already in the Proof of Humanity registry to vouch for you (right now just one, but it can be increased). So a malicious (or oblivious) human needs to vouch for an AI in order for the AI to get into the system, and then if someone realizes and removes the original AI, the whole network of AIs gets their registries revoked.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-22 04:01:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2n0ahy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o5eut2","parent_id":"t1_h2my06r","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Right on.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Right on.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-22 04:20:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2n1r8l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o5eut2","parent_id":"t1_h2n0ahy","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/earthquakequestion","body":"That whales wall is almost done, this is gonna get ugly","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That whales wall is almost done, this is gonna get ugly</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-06-22 04:56:19","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h2n4qd1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o5eut2","parent_id":"t3_o5eut2","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/earthquakequestion","body":"Wtf he replenished it.
