That way, if there are a few extra txs in the pool, they don't have to wait to go into the next block -- they can just go in this half full one. \n\n\\- Ethereum is basically a computer you can send commands to and execute those commands (mostly used for defi apps at this time -- kind of like the backend of an app). It keeps a global state of things (ie contract x's variable \"y\" has a value of z -- if you are not technical, think of \"state\" as a file that you keep writing to and deleting stuff from so it gets bigger and smaller in size) and that state must be propagated to each node. To keep this state  manageable (every node needs the state so that everyone is looking at the same picture, so every time it changes, the new state needs to be sent around to everyone), there is a cost for every action taken in a smart contract. Bc there is a cost, it keeps the state from bloating to a size that would make it impossible for normal computers and internet connections to handle it. This keeps Ethereum decentralized and secure.\n\n\\- Base fee is a variable -- it can go up or down depending on demand for block space. So, down if demand is down, up if demand is up. This fee is burned.\n\n\\- So now miners are paid by \"tip\" (don't quote me, bc I am a little vague on how miners make money now, but I think it's \"tx cost + tip\" where the gas (tx) cost is determined by how hard it is to do the proof of work necessary to secure the network -- watch this video to understand PoW b/c it is great [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7yvOlwBPoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7yvOlwBPoQ) )\n\n\\- There is also a \"max\" field that says \"Okay, I understand that base changes and I understand I am paying tip, but I don't want to pay more than this amount to get my tx included\"\n\n\\- So the first example shown is one where tip == max fee. What this basically means is \"Yeah, I want to pay the max fee every time. Just fill in the difference between base and max with the tip. So if my max is 60 and my tip is 60, then if base is 45 I will be giving a 15 tip to the miner.\" This is more like what gas is like now -- you always pay what your max is. The only difference is now, instead of going to miners, the base fee is burned and goes to no-one (or perhaps you can think it goes to the ETH holders b/c it makes the asset more scarce). \n\n\\- The next is more of an example of how 1559 is supposed to work. You say my max is 60, and I want to tip 20. So that means you expect the base to be 40 or less. If the base goes above 40, your tx won't go through (45 + 20 > 60) but if it goes below 50, you get a refund (35 + 20 = 55, so 5 goes back to you).\n\n\\- So, looking at the two, you can see the pros and cons. If base fee goes down between requesting your transaction and being selected for a block to be mined, then you pay more for the first option (you are always paying 60) but you pay less for the 2nd option. And if base goes up, then in the first your tx goes through, but in the second it might not!\n\n\\- So really, the problem I think she is outlining is that the \"EIP1559\" way (2nd way) still means your are betting on an unknown variable -- base fee -- when submitting your transaction. Will it go up? Who knows. Will it go down? Maybe. What do I set my 3 variables to make the proper trade-offs between cost and my transaction being included?\n\nSo, I think in a L1 world, this point -- the point that 1559 is no more predictable than our current iteration of transaction pricing -- is fair. I think a lot depends on how much the base fee fluctuates. If it doesn't fluctuate that much (I think that's what doubling the block size is trying to help with -- evening out fluctuations in periods of high use), then things will be a lot more predictable. If it fluctuates as much as it does now, then it is still am improvement for burning ETH, but the UX part of the proposal didn't pan out and we'll just have to try again. It's not like anyone has built this before haha.\n\nI think L2s lowering gas will make this much less of an issue, especially when it's only L2s creating transactions on L1 and they don't care if they spend an extra few bucks for non-optimal transaction costs.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I will *try* to summarize the issue, but it will be long (apologies in advance)</p>\n\n<p>Quick recap of 1559 (and a little of Ethereum): </p>\n\n<p>- So, block size doubles and they are trying to fill half-blocks.
