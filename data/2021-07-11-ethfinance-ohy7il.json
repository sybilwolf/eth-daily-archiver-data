I try to keep my own imagination out of if as like said the \"optims bias\" doesn't let you estimate it right. Actually I think I will die anyways before so my personal impact and skin in the game will be present but moderatly limited. However I think it's more than about one self.

Also the current prediction is based on the Demographic Transition Model\n\n- Stage 1: High Population Growth Potential.\n\n- Stage 2: Population Explosion.\n\n- Stage 3: Population Growth Starts to Level Off.\n\n- Stage 4: Stationary Population.\n\n- Stage 5: Further Changes in Birth Rates.\n\nDifferent countries different stages. That's why it will decline in first place.\n\nNow to the the topic in discussion. Quick check from Wikipedia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_apocalypse\n\n> Many academics and researchers posit that in actuality, unless a major course correction is imminently implemented, some or all of the Earth will be rendered uninhabitable as a result of extreme temperatures, severe weather events, an inability to grow crops, and an altered composition of the Earth's atmosphere.[1] [2] [3][4]\n\nSome extract from the \"Prediction\" wiki chapter\n\n> Emeritus Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber warned that if we continue as we are now, then over the next century we may bring civilization to an end. He predicted that humans would survive somehow, but that almost everything which had been built up over the past two thousand years would be destroyed. He rated chances of success in the fight against climate change as more than 5% but definitely less than 50%.[67]\n\n> In his 2019 BBC documentary Climate Change \u2013 The Facts, Sir David Attenborough warns that dramatic action needed to be taken against climate change within the next decade to avoid irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of human societies.[68]\n\n\nI liked this one as well, give many believe in technology.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63657-6\n\n> Based on the current resource consumption rates and best estimate of technological rate growth our study shows that we have very low probability, less than 10% in most optimistic estimate, to survive without facing a catastrophic collapse.\n\nAlso the problem with technology is that a new technology with its savings uses more ressources than before.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox\n\nThat's one of the reasons technology will not save us. However it was attributed to the maximum already in the nature paper.\n\nScientific consensus also said that giving up would just be the easy and lazy solution. We can stablize it will large and global efforts. We are just damn slow. And currently finance is driving this shutshow to park billions in Bahamas and just produce more and more garbage. Maybe ethereum will have a much major influence than I can hope. Finance drives a lot today, luckily not everything. But like said, technology alone is not enough.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The topic is now much wider than just the future of finance and how we save it.

Quick check from Wikipedia</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_apocalypse\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_apocalypse</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many academics and researchers posit that in actuality, unless a major course correction is imminently implemented, some or all of the Earth will be rendered uninhabitable as a result of extreme temperatures, severe weather events, an inability to grow crops, and an altered composition of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.[1] [2] [3][4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some extract from the &quot;Prediction&quot; wiki chapter</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Emeritus Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber warned that if we continue as we are now, then over the next century we may bring civilization to an end. He predicted that humans would survive somehow, but that almost everything which had been built up over the past two thousand years would be destroyed. He rated chances of success in the fight against climate change as more than 5% but definitely less than 50%.[67]</p>\n\n<p>In his 2019 BBC documentary Climate Change \u2013 The Facts, Sir David Attenborough warns that dramatic action needed to be taken against climate change within the next decade to avoid irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of human societies.[68]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I liked this one as well, give many believe in technology.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63657-6\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63657-6</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based on the current resource consumption rates and best estimate of technological rate growth our study shows that we have very low probability, less than 10% in most optimistic estimate, to survive without facing a catastrophic collapse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also the problem with technology is that a new technology with its savings uses more ressources than before.\n<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox</a></p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s one of the reasons technology will not save us. However it was attributed to the maximum already in the nature paper.</p>\n\n<p>Scientific consensus also said that giving up would just be the easy and lazy solution. We can stablize it will large and global efforts. We are just damn slow. And currently finance is driving this shutshow to park billions in Bahamas and just produce more and more garbage. Maybe ethereum will have a much major influence than I can hope. Finance drives a lot today, luckily not everything. But like said, technology alone is not enough.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-11 06:14:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h4t00y6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ohy7il","parent_id":"t1_h4sviot","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/WikiSummarizerBot","body":"**[Climate_apocalypse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_apocalypse)** \n \n >A climate apocalypse (also called a climate dystopia and a climate-induced collapse, among other names) generally denotes a hypothetical scenario involving the global collapse of human civilization and potential human extinction as either a direct or indirect result of anthropogenic climate change.

Tech support had escalated your open ticket for me to address because of its unique circumstances. After the initial back and forth and getting input from the CTO on how to get further data from the signing request you were having an issue with, I had forgotten to follow up.  \n\r  \nThat is 100% my fault and I take full responsibility.  \n\r  \nNot letting any user requests fall through the cracks is of critical importance as our tech support team scales up, so, in response to your ticket, this Sunday morning we\u2019re on Slack formalizing the framework for issue tracking when specific matters are escalated to team members outside of tech support like the engineers.  \n\r  \nRight after this I will dig back in on your ticket and get you the steps on how to get information regarding your signing request so we can help you further.  \n\r  \nI understand that you\u2019re frustrated due to your experience with me in particular, but I\u2019d also like to take the opportunity to address some misconceptions in the rest of your post.\r  \n\r  \nThe best way at launch, and today, to use the Lattice1 is with our MetaMask fork so there was always the ability to use it everywhere. We did launch with only support for the standard Ethereum wallet derivation path used by most hardware and software wallets, but we quickly found several users were upgrading from Ledger products and wanted to keep using their non-standard Ledger seeds so we prioritized adding support for wallets generated using the Ledger Live and Ledger Legacy paths earlier this year. This wasn\u2019t a matter of \u201csuper basic testing\u201d being skipped, it was a matter of supporting a competitor\u2019s design choices to make it easy for people to upgrade.  \n\r  \nRe: MetaMask and the fork, that was a matter out of our hands at launch. We 100% understand that the most requested thing for the Lattice1 is official MetaMask client support. And I\u2019m excited that it\u2019s coming soon.  \n\r  \nTo that end, we did have some requests to do a Firefox build as well, but it might make sense to wait for the official release since this was an uncommon ask.  \n\r  \nTo that point, a lot of the tickets and complaints we do get focus on things outside of our control \u2013 for example we dealt with a high volume of panicked tickets all at once for a new NFT project on Polygon from people who were angry because they thought their Lattice1 wasn\u2019t letting them access their purchase. So I went to that team\u2019s Discord and they said they don\u2019t support any hardware wallets. I dug in further and it turns out they incorrectly implemented a new signing standard \u2013 we offered our team\u2019s assistance to help fix their code so our users could use their dapp and they were grateful and then never followed up.  \n\r  \nThe Lattice1 is the only hardware wallet designed around Ethereum security needs and the first and only one that provides hardware security for new, yet common, signing standards like EIP-712. It\u2019s a lot harder to stay at the cutting-edge vs selling a BTC-focused hardware wallet that basically stays untouched after it\u2019s complete.  \n\r  \nAll our competitors make it look like they\u2019re doing these things but are hashing signatures in your browser or in their unsecured Android-based OS. So, not faking security means we have to draw the screen from secure enclave which is why there are not flashy graphics. And generating a signature in a secure enclave does take a moment longer than doing it in your computer\u2019s browser and then asking you to click a button to approve on your USB hardware wallet.  \n\r  \nWe set out to address the problems with Ledger and Trezor projects back in 2017. This is our original direction and we have executed on it. Energy was always intended as a showcase application for how powerful secure hardware could enable new real world use cases. And it can still be a game changer for this purpose, hybrid crypto/traditional card point-of-sales transactions, and a whole lot more, but we should be building the tooling not every use case. For a very long time I personally pushed to narrow our focus to hardware security and privacy and it was, without a doubt, the right move and I\u2019m glad we did it.  \n\r  \nAddressing how legacy USB wallets don\u2019t provide adequate security is why we made several of the design choices that seem odd to you. For example, avoiding USB and Bluetooth lower the attack surface present with USB wallets by completely isolating your HSM from the outside world.

After the initial back and forth and getting input from the CTO on how to get further data from the signing request you were having an issue with, I had forgotten to follow up.  </p>\n\n<p>That is 100% my fault and I take full responsibility.  </p>\n\n<p>Not letting any user requests fall through the cracks is of critical importance as our tech support team scales up, so, in response to your ticket, this Sunday morning we\u2019re on Slack formalizing the framework for issue tracking when specific matters are escalated to team members outside of tech support like the engineers.  </p>\n\n<p>Right after this I will dig back in on your ticket and get you the steps on how to get information regarding your signing request so we can help you further.  </p>\n\n<p>I understand that you\u2019re frustrated due to your experience with me in particular, but I\u2019d also like to take the opportunity to address some misconceptions in the rest of your post.</p>\n\n<p>The best way at launch, and today, to use the Lattice1 is with our MetaMask fork so there was always the ability to use it everywhere. We did launch with only support for the standard Ethereum wallet derivation path used by most hardware and software wallets, but we quickly found several users were upgrading from Ledger products and wanted to keep using their non-standard Ledger seeds so we prioritized adding support for wallets generated using the Ledger Live and Ledger Legacy paths earlier this year. This wasn\u2019t a matter of \u201csuper basic testing\u201d being skipped, it was a matter of supporting a competitor\u2019s design choices to make it easy for people to upgrade.  </p>\n\n<p>Re: MetaMask and the fork, that was a matter out of our hands at launch. We 100% understand that the most requested thing for the Lattice1 is official MetaMask client support. And I\u2019m excited that it\u2019s coming soon.  </p>\n\n<p>To that end, we did have some requests to do a Firefox build as well, but it might make sense to wait for the official release since this was an uncommon ask.  </p>\n\n<p>To that point, a lot of the tickets and complaints we do get focus on things outside of our control \u2013 for example we dealt with a high volume of panicked tickets all at once for a new NFT project on Polygon from people who were angry because they thought their Lattice1 wasn\u2019t letting them access their purchase. So I went to that team\u2019s Discord and they said they don\u2019t support any hardware wallets. I dug in further and it turns out they incorrectly implemented a new signing standard \u2013 we offered our team\u2019s assistance to help fix their code so our users could use their dapp and they were grateful and then never followed up.  </p>\n\n<p>The Lattice1 is the only hardware wallet designed around Ethereum security needs and the first and only one that provides hardware security for new, yet common, signing standards like EIP-712. It\u2019s a lot harder to stay at the cutting-edge vs selling a BTC-focused hardware wallet that basically stays untouched after it\u2019s complete.  </p>\n\n<p>All our competitors make it look like they\u2019re doing these things but are hashing signatures in your browser or in their unsecured Android-based OS. So, not faking security means we have to draw the screen from secure enclave which is why there are not flashy graphics. And generating a signature in a secure enclave does take a moment longer than doing it in your computer\u2019s browser and then asking you to click a button to approve on your USB hardware wallet.  </p>\n\n<p>We set out to address the problems with Ledger and Trezor projects back in 2017. This is our original direction and we have executed on it. Energy was always intended as a showcase application for how powerful secure hardware could enable new real world use cases. And it can still be a game changer for this purpose, hybrid crypto/traditional card point-of-sales transactions, and a whole lot more, but we should be building the tooling not every use case. For a very long time I personally pushed to narrow our focus to hardware security and privacy and it was, without a doubt, the right move and I\u2019m glad we did it.  </p>\n\n<p>Addressing how legacy USB wallets don\u2019t provide adequate security is why we made several of the design choices that seem odd to you. For example, avoiding USB and Bluetooth lower the attack surface present with USB wallets by completely isolating your HSM from the outside world. There\u2019s a lot of benefits:  </p>\n\n<p>\u2022 There is no remote contact with the HSM.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 There are no accessible factory or engineering debug features.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Limited signing payloads to a fixed memory size eliminates overflow attacks.  </p>\n\n<p>This post is already a wall of text, so if you would like to discuss the ABI functionality and other design choices I can get into those one by one, but in each case we were focused on uncompromising security that zero other products on the market provide at this time.  </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for the feedback, and, again, I\u2019m sorry I personally failed to address your open ticket in keeping with our own standards.  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks,<br/>\nJustin Leroux</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-11 07:29:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h4t7o8i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ohy7il","parent_id":"t1_h4sksaw","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/KuDeTa","body":"As you say, this is all software and most of the \u201cissues\u201d you rightly raise have been fixed one by one.
