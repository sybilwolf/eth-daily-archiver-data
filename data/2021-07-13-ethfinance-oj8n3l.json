You'll notice upon depositing into an L2 you get nothing back trackable on mainnet. You'll recall the early days of blockchain when we described an 0x address as kind of a PO Box where your pure funds (can) always live, secure, forever. Now with Optimism you're not so much holding funds in your PO Box... you're holding a receipt. That receipt is in the form of the entry and exit claims that verify your transaction into the L2.

Admittedly, I'm not sure when bonded aggregators, validators, and Sequencers split off into different things. So the main takeaway here is that your funds are in the hands of another virtual machine and verified by non-L1 nodes.

I believe that also explains in part why this bull seemed shorter than previous.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-14 06:08:01","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-07-14 06:23:42","id":"h55f3fi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oj8n3l","parent_id":"t1_h53zzgw","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"I'm not saying it is or isn't, but diminishing returns should be expected each cycle as MCAP increases and institutions enter the game","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m not saying it is or isn&#39;t, but diminishing returns should be expected each cycle as MCAP increases and institutions enter the game</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-13 18:36:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h53tvvp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oj8n3l","parent_id":"t1_h53j1n4","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/vsesuki","body":"Crypto doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum.
