I&#39;m so happy the community chipped in, and so happy the key devs and contributors (esp client teams and Tim Beiko) get a decent chunk of change out of this. Top notch devs working on ethereum are actually paying a massive opportunity cost working for a public good. </p>\n\n<p>A good example is Joseph Delong, now Sushi CTO. He worked for Teku client team hired by Consensys iirc. Consensus/EF pays around $80-100k annually from what I&#39;ve heard. A core Dev at a blue chip defi protocol <em>easily</em> makes $10mil++ from token vesting alone, while base salary for experienced solidity devs is $400k+ for top defi protocols. The gap is so vast.</p>\n\n<p>Ofc not everything is about money, and some of these devs probably get a deeper sense of purpose, and will be remembered as public goods contributors in history. But still, we have to acknowledge that there&#39;s a disconnect here in compensation, and I&#39;m glad projects like this might help to address that gap in a small way. Even if the material amount is small, it also goes out as a big thank you from 1500+ community members, including me, and I hope that means something to the devs :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 15:29:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h66jk26","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t1_h665m0a","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/blackdowney","body":"You know I thought maybe the bull market was over, but after watching that Ashton Kutcher Ethereum video... \n\nIt was like a late 90s viral \u201cwhat\u2019s the internet?\u201d type of video that feels really relevant.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You know I thought maybe the bull market was over, but after watching that Ashton Kutcher Ethereum video... </p>\n\n<p>It was like a late 90s viral \u201cwhat\u2019s the internet?\u201d type of video that feels really relevant.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 04:01:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h643e36","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t3_op73ks","score":57,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"According to Guy Does Prison, here's what ETH price can be if it manages to capture:\n\n0.1% of TradFi: $4000\n\n1% of Tradfi: $40,000\n\n10% of Tradfi: $400,000\n\nJust chill and relax.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>According to Guy Does Prison, here&#39;s what ETH price can be if it manages to capture:</p>\n\n<p>0.1% of TradFi: $4000</p>\n\n<p>1% of Tradfi: $40,000</p>\n\n<p>10% of Tradfi: $400,000</p>\n\n<p>Just chill and relax.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 05:52:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h64dmu2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t3_op73ks","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ArcadesOfAntiquity","body":"I may chill, I may relax, but by god I refuse to do both","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I may chill, I may relax, but by god I refuse to do both</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 06:01:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h64ej2g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t1_h64dmu2","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/anor_wondo","body":"I don't know much about the guy but his blog posts are a really good read.\n\nIs he hated because of the double digit shitcoin stuff?

But because of this transferring or migrating a Vault is a very simple transaction and to move it to and fro takes like a couple hundred thousand gas, really no biggie.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, a Compound or Aave position is made up of cTokens or aTokens combined with the debt balance kept by the protocol. The process of migrating that position (for example from an EOA to a smart wallet on defisaver or dsa on instadapp) involves making a flash loan to clear debt, then transferring the tokens, and then taking up debt again in that new position (on the smart wallet) to clear the initial debt.</p>\n\n<p>The main problem is that a Compound position like that (e.g. an ETH deposit + Dai debt) cannot be transferred/migrated back to the EOA in the first place, as all the needed calls cannot be made from the EOA like they can from a proxy (smart contract) wallet when going in that direction.</p>\n\n<p>The other problem, for example for someone who perhaps had a Compound position open on a smart wallet (dsproxy) via defi saver, would be the sheer amount of gas needed to make the move to instadapp, claim, and then move back, and especially so if there are multiple assets involved. We&#39;re still trying to figure out something useful for this case specifically, but no promises just yet.</p>\n\n<p>Really hate to disappoint, but hope this at least helps clarify the overall issue.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 15:36:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h66kgwd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t1_h66hkap","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/mattnumber","body":"You did the opposite of disappointing by giving super-clear + -detailed info - protocol design quirks obvs aren't your fault, and I thank you a bunch for taking the time to write that out. \n\nEdit: nvm; I'll claim it or not","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You did the opposite of disappointing by giving super-clear + -detailed info - protocol design quirks obvs aren&#39;t your fault, and I thank you a bunch for taking the time to write that out. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: nvm; I&#39;ll claim it or not</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 16:22:26","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-07-23 17:44:00","id":"h66q40c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t1_h66kgwd","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Sargos","body":"Does this preserve your Maker Vault number if you have a low one?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Does this preserve your Maker Vault number if you have a low one?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-23 10:27:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h69s7a8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t1_h66bqks","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nikola_j","body":"It does, yes, a Maker CDP/Vault is sort of like an NFT, so it's beeing moved to and fro as is :)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It does, yes, a Maker CDP/Vault is sort of like an NFT, so it&#39;s beeing moved to and fro as is :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-23 10:29:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h69si4m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t1_h69s7a8","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"Mila was already #1 on my celeb crush list, now it's confirmed","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Mila was already #1 on my celeb crush list, now it&#39;s confirmed</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 16:50:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h66t015","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t3_op73ks","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/savage-dragon","body":"She can't even describe blockchain. 1/10","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>She can&#39;t even describe blockchain. 1/10</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 17:51:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h66zxjw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t1_h66t015","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/hipaces","body":"Bad Moms ftw","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Bad Moms ftw</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 17:54:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h6708wp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t1_h66t015","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-22 08:05:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h64u8k3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_op73ks","parent_id":"t3_op73ks","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I experienced the exact same thing with my trash bank.
