This is a quick writeup on my findings in hopes that someone might learn something:\n\nMEV or \u201cMiner Extractable Value\u201d is the umbrella term for money that miners can extract from ethereum when they decide how they create a new block. Whether that means censoring transactions, inserting their own transactions or re-ordering how the transactions are executed. Described first in the [Flash Boys paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf).\n\nThis allows miners to frontrun many types of arbitrage opportunities do sandwich attacks censor transactions win auctions etc.\n\n**This is a problem because:** How good you are at MEV decides your profitability as a miner, this means people with better MEV algorithms and techniques should outperform the market and eventually outcompete all other miners. This promotes centralization.\n\nIt is sometimes possible to extract more value by reorganising a couple blocks, this hurts finality and undermines ethereum.\n\nThe \"value\" comes out of the pocket of ethereum users, it is not fun to get front-run. Imagine you are waiting hours trying to buy a new NFT (cat themed possibly) and miners end up pushing your transaction out and minting all of them for 1 gwei. not fun, and I would argue unfair. MEV positions miners as a middle man between you and the free market trying to extort as much money out of you as possible.\n\nThis is an issue on both L1 and L2 as the sequencer of L2 can still get MEV.\n\n**So what are the solutions to this?:**\n\nKarl Floersch from Optimism has proposed [MEV Auctions (MEVA)](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-auction-auctioning-transaction-ordering-rights-as-a-solution-to-miner-extractable-value/6788):\n\nThe idea here is that you auction off the right to change ordering of what's in a block/several blocks. By auctioning off MEV to the highest bidder you can comfortably be a \"dumb\" miner again.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* fixes decentralization problem\n* no re-org attacks\n* potentially more money for security of chain\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Not just accepting MEV but actively incentivizing it. More value will be extracted from users.\n\nThis solution has support from optimism team, Hudson Jameson, VB and some Flash Boys authors, many others.\n\n**Argument against MEVA**: [Separating block inclusion/exclusion from ordering when it is more profitable to control both will eventually lead to centralization anyway.](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/meva-what-is-it-good-for-de8a96c0e67c)\n\nAnother solution is [\"Decentralized fair sequencing](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum)\" by Offchain Labs (arbitrum):\n\nThe idea here is to use a decentralized set of computers that come to consensus on what the ordering should be.\n\n**Pros:** no more MEV\n\n**Cons:** Difficult to build\n\nThis solution has support from Arbitrum team, Ari Juels from Cornell/FlashBoys, Steven Goldfeder Arbitrum/FlashBoys, many others.\n\nAnother solution is [Fair Sequencing Services by Chainlink](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/):\n\nThe idea here is that you have an oracle network decide the ordering based on your criteria, whether that be fair ordering or some other ordering.

I personally like the Arbitrum approach better, and hope to see the end of MEV.\n\nFor more on this check [this great deep dive on twitter by Ben Simon](https://twitter.com/benjaminsimon97/status/1380291321286569986?lang=da)\n\nWhat do you think about all of this? Did I miss something?\n\n**TLDR:** MEV is very bad and the Ethereum community needs to do something about it. Arbitrum and Optimism approach MEV very differently and the community will eventually decide what is the better way to handle it by what networks we use.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I thought I had a good grasp of the MEV concept but didn&#39;t know that there is a large split in the community about what to do about it! This is a quick writeup on my findings in hopes that someone might learn something:</p>\n\n<p>MEV or \u201cMiner Extractable Value\u201d is the umbrella term for money that miners can extract from ethereum when they decide how they create a new block. Whether that means censoring transactions, inserting their own transactions or re-ordering how the transactions are executed. Described first in the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf\">Flash Boys paper</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This allows miners to frontrun many types of arbitrage opportunities do sandwich attacks censor transactions win auctions etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is a problem because:</strong> How good you are at MEV decides your profitability as a miner, this means people with better MEV algorithms and techniques should outperform the market and eventually outcompete all other miners. This promotes centralization.</p>\n\n<p>It is sometimes possible to extract more value by reorganising a couple blocks, this hurts finality and undermines ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>The &quot;value&quot; comes out of the pocket of ethereum users, it is not fun to get front-run. Imagine you are waiting hours trying to buy a new NFT (cat themed possibly) and miners end up pushing your transaction out and minting all of them for 1 gwei. not fun, and I would argue unfair. MEV positions miners as a middle man between you and the free market trying to extort as much money out of you as possible.</p>\n\n<p>This is an issue on both L1 and L2 as the sequencer of L2 can still get MEV.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what are the solutions to this?:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Karl Floersch from Optimism has proposed <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-auction-auctioning-transaction-ordering-rights-as-a-solution-to-miner-extractable-value/6788\">MEV Auctions (MEVA)</a>:</p>\n\n<p>The idea here is that you auction off the right to change ordering of what&#39;s in a block/several blocks. By auctioning off MEV to the highest bidder you can comfortably be a &quot;dumb&quot; miner again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>fixes decentralization problem</li>\n<li>no re-org attacks</li>\n<li>potentially more money for security of chain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Not just accepting MEV but actively incentivizing it. More value will be extracted from users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This solution has support from optimism team, Hudson Jameson, VB and some Flash Boys authors, many others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Argument against MEVA</strong>: <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/meva-what-is-it-good-for-de8a96c0e67c\">Separating block inclusion/exclusion from ordering when it is more profitable to control both will eventually lead to centralization anyway.</a></p>\n\n<p>Another solution is <a href=\"https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum\">&quot;Decentralized fair sequencing</a>&quot; by Offchain Labs (arbitrum):</p>\n\n<p>The idea here is to use a decentralized set of computers that come to consensus on what the ordering should be.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> no more MEV</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Difficult to build</p>\n\n<p>This solution has support from Arbitrum team, Ari Juels from Cornell/FlashBoys, Steven Goldfeder Arbitrum/FlashBoys, many others.</p>\n\n<p>Another solution is <a href=\"https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/\">Fair Sequencing Services by Chainlink</a>:</p>\n\n<p>The idea here is that you have an oracle network decide the ordering based on your criteria, whether that be fair ordering or some other ordering. This can be done on a per-smart-contract basis and does not require changes to L1/L2</p>\n\n<p>As you can see Optimism and Arbitrum are going two completely different ways on this.

Gas price is completely independent from gas limit. If you're filling up your car at the gas station to go on a trip, gas limit is like the amount of gallons you put in your car to prepare for the trip (you want to buy enough to get you go your destination, and it's okay to have a bit extra), whereas gas price is the dollars per gallon (or on Ethereum, the fractional ether/gwei per unit of gas) you pay.\n\nIt's helpful to think of \"gas\" as a currency separate from Ether, that you buy using Ether and that only exists while your transaction is executing.\n\nGas price is the amount of ether your transaction pays per unit of gas it consumes. It dictates the amount of Ether you pay for the transaction, per unit of gas it uses, if it gets included by a miner.\n\nGas limit is the total amount of units of gas you allow your transaction to use. When your transaction starts to execute, it \"buys\" this amount of gas at the price you set (say, \"50 gwei\" per gas).

The explanation I've read is that there are inherent market inefficiencies due to human psychology, and that inflation can actually leverage human psychology to address these inefficiencies. \n\nThe main example given is that prices, especially wages, are \"sticky.\" That is, they do not shift smoothly in response to supply/demand. So during a recession, instead of employees all taking a 20% pay cut, employers are more likely to just cut 20% of the workforce and keep other salaries the same. Being able to increase inflation during recession allows employers to cut wages in real terms without cutting it in nominal terms, and this can have a good effect for employment and on the economy overall. This view is not the modern monetarist view, which AFAICT is just \"let's keep economic growth higher than debt interest rate and we're good, and what will spur economic growth just so happens to be whatever we feel like funding at any given time.\"\n\nI know approximately diddly squat about behavioral or monetary economics and so don't really know whether this argument has any merit or not, but was wondering what people here thought.

The explanation I&#39;ve read is that there are inherent market inefficiencies due to human psychology, and that inflation can actually leverage human psychology to address these inefficiencies. </p>\n\n<p>The main example given is that prices, especially wages, are &quot;sticky.&quot; That is, they do not shift smoothly in response to supply/demand. So during a recession, instead of employees all taking a 20% pay cut, employers are more likely to just cut 20% of the workforce and keep other salaries the same. Being able to increase inflation during recession allows employers to cut wages in real terms without cutting it in nominal terms, and this can have a good effect for employment and on the economy overall. This view is not the modern monetarist view, which AFAICT is just &quot;let&#39;s keep economic growth higher than debt interest rate and we&#39;re good, and what will spur economic growth just so happens to be whatever we feel like funding at any given time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I know approximately diddly squat about behavioral or monetary economics and so don&#39;t really know whether this argument has any merit or not, but was wondering what people here thought.
