I may be slightly wrong, so please someone correct me if I am.\n\nGas is a representation of a certain amount of computing power. Different transactions require more or less gas. An ETH trasfer uses the least amount of gas while complex contract interactions require more gas. Different contracts and different contract functions can require different amounts of coputation, hence not all NFTs are the same. Often, it is not known how much gas is required to perform an action as how do you know how much effort it takes to compute something if you haven't computed it yet? So for this reason you set a gas limit, this is the maximum amount of computing power you are willing to pay for. This doesn't all have to be used up. For example, many people trying to mint stonercats today set limits too low and as they were minting a cat, they ran out of gas and the transaction was canceled. However, the computation was still done by the miners so they lost their whole gas fee. On the other hand, for users who tried to mint a cat after they ran out, they only paid a few % of their max tx fee because the contract canceled their computation almost immediately. Then you set a gas price. This is how much you are willing to pay for each unit of computation. Miners normally include transactions with the highest gas price because each block can only fit in 15 million gas and you want the average price of this gas to be as high as possible to make the most money you can while mining. So in order to be included in the next block, you have to look at previous blocks to see what gas price you need to bid.\n\nAs a result of all of this, you have:\n\nTransaction fee = gas price (how much you need to get in the next block) * gas used (how complex your transaction is)\n\nand the gas limit is the maximum amount of gas (which given your gas price) limits how much you're willing to pay for the transaction.\n\nI hope this helps.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s my understanding.
