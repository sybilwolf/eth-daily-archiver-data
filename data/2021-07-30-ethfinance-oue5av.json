Then there&#39;s liquidity mining for things like the xU3LP postions, ETH/XTK LP, xSNXa, team tokens vesting etc which would be straight inflation and sell pressure in my mind.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Another thing as a complete sidebar I wanted to note was the currently already earned $196,262.36 worth of revenue will be converted from the various tokens it&#39;s in to XTK to be distributed. I&#39;d say most of that volume is going to go through the Uniswap V2 ETH/XTK pool, which only has $1,590,496 of liquidity. That kind of buy pressure on such a small pool could have a fairly hefty price impact in the positive direction for XTK. Even with the conversion being done over several transactions/weeks. All this while more and more XTK is being pulled out of circulation to be staked. Bullish.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-02 12:46:56","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-08-02 12:56:49","id":"h7gsk98","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oue5av","parent_id":"t1_h7gc6v1","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Very nice!

Long term, the results oracle can be funded by protocol fees (eg. if implemented by an L2 project, sequencer auctions are one candidate). But unlike other public goods funding DAOs, the Results Oracle funds projects retroactively, rewarding projects that it recognizes as having already provided value.</p>\n\n<p>- A simple early version (of the DAO) might be ~20\u201350 hand-picked technically skilled long-time contributors from the ecosystem that is implementing this scheme. iterating on the DAO process from this simple initial version would probably be a requirement.on funding:</p>\n\n<p>it seems like this is currently still in the idea phase - the idea is being thrown out there - how it gets funded will probably be a process of the community creating a culture or expectation around it.. ie i imagine its like how uniswap started the airdropping phenomenon and other projects jumped on board the idea. heres what the optomism team is proposing for ideas around funding this type of project:</p>\n\n<p>Seed funding</p>\n\n<p>What we\u2019re proposing above is a multi-layered ecosystem, and it\u2019s difficult to get a new ecosystem quickly built up from scratch! There are several strategies different participants can take to help the ecosystem get started:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Grants programs by projects and foundations</li>\n<li>Projects selling their public good tokens on Uniswap</li>\n<li>Quadratic fundin</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>so a public goods funding DAO could use gitcoin grants and quadratic funding as one mechanism for getting funds to retroactively pay public goods projects and providers that have been chosen by DAO.</p>\n\n<p>OR you know, anyone could probably come up with some idea for funding this DAO - optomism has already announced they are giving profits to public goods (ie &quot;the Results Oracle&quot;) - from <a href=\"https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c\">https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c</a>:</p>\n\n<p>the Optimism team, commit to giving all our profits made from sequencing (prior to decentralizing the sequencer) to public goods funding experiments, including the first public goods exit</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-07-30 16:15:37","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-07-30 17:00:26","id":"h7550dt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oue5av","parent_id":"t1_h73iym4","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/JimJimmyJim-the-1st","body":"I think gitcoin is proactive funding for projects that might be public goods. \n\nIf it\u2019s NFT style, then are we relying on donations?
