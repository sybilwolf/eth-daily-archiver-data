T~~he calculations were done at different times, so the difference is probably just price fluctuations messing with me.~~\n\nCosmicCollusion's method:\n\n**6,123,730.72 (xXTKa full market cap)/ 675,816.10(annual revenue) = 9.06 P/E**\n\nLogris' Method:\n\n**61,335,444 (staked XTK)/102,933,456 (circulating XTK) = 0.5958747**\n\n**Benefit to XTK stakers: 675,816.10(annual revenue) \\* (1/ 0.5958747) = 1,134,158.03**\n\n**10,276,898 (total XTK market cap)/ 1,134,158.03 = 9.06 P/E**\n\nThat's A LOT LOWER than I originally would've imagined and where I'm getting really tripped up is correcting for new XTK entering the market. There's 1% of XTK being supplied to xXTKa holders over 3 months, that works out to a rate of 40,000,000XTK/year. But the way it's entering is by being distributed to xXTKa holders where they can redeem their xXTKa for more and more XTK over time, not separate rewards that can be claimed and dumped. So is this discounted? Then there's liquidity mining for things like the xU3LP postions, ETH/XTK LP, xSNXa, team tokens vesting, **rXTK holders redeeming for XTK** etc. which would be straight inflation and sell pressure in my mind. It's a bit much for me to calculate.\n\nOther things to note are **I'm** **~~not completely~~** **certain that 100% of these fees will be returned to xXTKa stakers**, ~~but from my understanding so far that's how it'll work~~ and I'm definitely taking some liberties extrapolating the xTKN positions out a year. The AUM of a lot of them dropped off considerably after the xBNT and xSNX exploit and then again once liquidity mining incentives dried up [and here's some evidence to back up that statement](https://duneanalytics.com/donkhalil/xtoken-market). But there are two things that I believe will drive AUM back up and generate more fees for xXTKa holders to earn.\n\nFirstly the release of future xTKN products and xU3LP positions. More products > greater addressable market > more AUM > more fees for xXTKa stakers to earn. The upcoming products include:\n\nxU3LP Wave 2:\n\nxU3LPd: sETH-WETH\n\nxU3LPe: WBTC-renBTC\n\nxU3LPf: UST-USDT\n\nxU3LPg: FRAX-USDC\n\nxU3LPh: BUSD-USDT\n\nxTKNs in progress:\n\nxLQTY\n\nxALPHA\n\nxPERP\n\nxUMA\n\n**xHEGIC**\n\nSecondly, the release of the xToken Money Market, **(otherwise known as xLENDING?)**. Which will open up greater levels of capital efficiency for xTKN holders. Currently if you stake in the native protocol of most xTKNs, that's dead capital....a smooth lego block being snapped onto your money legos. You can't do anything but earn the staking yield. Now compare that to SUSHI staking, where you are returned xSUSHI, a tokenized form of staked SUSHI that constantly gains value relative to SUSHI as SushiSwap fees are distributed to xSUSHI holders via increasing the amount of SUSHI you can redeem your xSUSHI for. xSUSHI is not dead capital. It's not a smooth lego. Holders can LP it for trading fees and earn extra yield, they can lend it on money markets like Aave and earn a yield there...or lever up and borrow against it and speculate to really juice returns. xToken Money Market with xTKN positions will open up this kind of capital efficiency for all xTKN projects.\n\nBetter yet there's talks of slapping the two products together and really getting things going: \"xU3LP3x: Once Lending is launched, we\u2019re planning on building leveraged products on top of our xU3LP funds (likely on ETH and BTC pairs). Leveraging our own internal lending service, we can privilege our own funds to make them non-liquidatable, allowing us to experiment with higher leverage. Additionally, these products will be earning Uni V3 trading fees, which we expect to roughly cancel out interest payments from leverage/debt.\"\n\nAnd here's the cherry on top. The current already earned **$249,560.34** worth of revenue **and all future revenue** will be converted from the various tokens it's in to XTK to be distributed. I'd say most of that volume is going to go through the Uniswap V2 ETH/XTK pool, which only has **$1,502,501** of liquidity. That kind of buy pressure on such a small pool could have a fairly hefty price impact in the positive direction for XTK. Even with the conversion being done over several transactions/weeks. All this while more and more XTK is being pulled out of circulation to be staked. **Mega bullish on XTK.**","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m about to do my best Logris impression after chatting with them about it a bit.

It&#39;s a bit much for me to calculate.</p>\n\n<p>Other things to note are <strong>I&#39;m</strong> <strong><del>not completely</del></strong> <strong>certain that 100% of these fees will be returned to xXTKa stakers</strong>, <del>but from my understanding so far that&#39;s how it&#39;ll work</del> and I&#39;m definitely taking some liberties extrapolating the xTKN positions out a year. The AUM of a lot of them dropped off considerably after the xBNT and xSNX exploit and then again once liquidity mining incentives dried up <a href=\"https://duneanalytics.com/donkhalil/xtoken-market\">and here&#39;s some evidence to back up that statement</a>. But there are two things that I believe will drive AUM back up and generate more fees for xXTKa holders to earn.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly the release of future xTKN products and xU3LP positions. More products &gt; greater addressable market &gt; more AUM &gt; more fees for xXTKa stakers to earn. The upcoming products include:</p>\n\n<p>xU3LP Wave 2:</p>\n\n<p>xU3LPd: sETH-WETH</p>\n\n<p>xU3LPe: WBTC-renBTC</p>\n\n<p>xU3LPf: UST-USDT</p>\n\n<p>xU3LPg: FRAX-USDC</p>\n\n<p>xU3LPh: BUSD-USDT</p>\n\n<p>xTKNs in progress:</p>\n\n<p>xLQTY</p>\n\n<p>xALPHA</p>\n\n<p>xPERP</p>\n\n<p>xUMA</p>\n\n<p><strong>xHEGIC</strong></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the release of the xToken Money Market, <strong>(otherwise known as xLENDING?)</strong>. Which will open up greater levels of capital efficiency for xTKN holders. Currently if you stake in the native protocol of most xTKNs, that&#39;s dead capital....a smooth lego block being snapped onto your money legos. You can&#39;t do anything but earn the staking yield. Now compare that to SUSHI staking, where you are returned xSUSHI, a tokenized form of staked SUSHI that constantly gains value relative to SUSHI as SushiSwap fees are distributed to xSUSHI holders via increasing the amount of SUSHI you can redeem your xSUSHI for. xSUSHI is not dead capital. It&#39;s not a smooth lego. Holders can LP it for trading fees and earn extra yield, they can lend it on money markets like Aave and earn a yield there...or lever up and borrow against it and speculate to really juice returns. xToken Money Market with xTKN positions will open up this kind of capital efficiency for all xTKN projects.</p>\n\n<p>Better yet there&#39;s talks of slapping the two products together and really getting things going: &quot;xU3LP3x: Once Lending is launched, we\u2019re planning on building leveraged products on top of our xU3LP funds (likely on ETH and BTC pairs). Leveraging our own internal lending service, we can privilege our own funds to make them non-liquidatable, allowing us to experiment with higher leverage. Additionally, these products will be earning Uni V3 trading fees, which we expect to roughly cancel out interest payments from leverage/debt.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And here&#39;s the cherry on top. The current already earned <strong>$249,560.34</strong> worth of revenue <strong>and all future revenue</strong> will be converted from the various tokens it&#39;s in to XTK to be distributed. I&#39;d say most of that volume is going to go through the Uniswap V2 ETH/XTK pool, which only has <strong>$1,502,501</strong> of liquidity. That kind of buy pressure on such a small pool could have a fairly hefty price impact in the positive direction for XTK. Even with the conversion being done over several transactions/weeks. All this while more and more XTK is being pulled out of circulation to be staked. <strong>Mega bullish on XTK.</strong></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-03 00:32:50","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-08-03 22:01:46","id":"h7j0ojq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_owwcna","parent_id":"t3_owwcna","score":39,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptomoon2020","body":"Looks like the student has become the teacher.

As such, it can be relied upon to look out for establishment interests (not that there's anything wrong with that).  What we heard today should inform our expectations about how regulators will proceed.  \n\nIt's nice to have an SEC leader who understands many of the things we care about; certainly better than the alternative.  As indicated, he sees real potential in the crypto field, and believes it could catalyze change in finance and money.  He appears to view crypto primarily as private money, which is understandable, especially given his position.  In my opinion, that view fails to appreciate what general-purpose crypto networks can become.  An asset like Ethereum isn't trying to be money in the traditional sense; it's a generalization of money that encompasses much more.  \n\nI have no objection to \"protecting investors and consumers, guarding against illicit activity, and ensuring financial stability.\"  It's clearly true that fraud, scams, and abuse are common in the crypto world.  Still, while I sympathize with the intent to protect the uninformed, I'm not convinced such an undertaking is practical in crypto (though perhaps it can be effective in narrowly constrained circumstances).  Personally, I shy away from projects which can reasonably be characterized as expecting profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.  Ethereum, for example, clearly doesn't fit this description; the value of Ether derives from community network effects, not the efforts of a few.  \n\nI'll be frank:  Most crypto investors lose money because they're stupid.  The only way to prevent this phenomenon is to require all crypto market activity to fit into a very small and very old box.  Enhanced requirements for disclosures and market oversight may accomplish very little, while causing significant harm.  How is a country with just over 4% of the world's population going to dictate the terms of an evolving global movement?  It can't, and it won't.  The best the Chairman can hope for is compliance from a small subset of the crypto community, providing a safe haven for those who can't handle the real thing.  That's a win, I guess?  \n\nI'm not suggesting the SEC and other authorities shouldn't pursue wrongdoers, or try to maintain influence in this new world.  I expect them to continue providing a valuable service as garbage collectors, charging the worst offenders against whom clear cases can be made.  That said, crypto networks operate at a level that's above the heads of our bureaucratic masters; these phenomena are remaking the possibilities of human interaction, and don't behave for apparatchiks who send angry letters.  The revolution will proceed with or without the approval of such people.  \n\nMake no mistake: Most trading and lending platforms will remove individual tokens that are deemed securities, while continuing to decline SEC oversight.  Stablecoins don't have to be linked to existing fiat money to do their job in the crypto ecosystem (though it's admittedly convenient).  Transacting value over decentralized networks is a basic human right, and is not to be abridged on the grounds that a few folks in power might lose some of their control over \"public policy goals,\" whatever that means.  \n\nSome good news: Commissioner Gensler all but said he's in favor of ETFs that are limited to CME-traded Bitcoin futures.  The CME trades Ether futures too, right? ;)  Turning to the fourth area of emphasis, \"facilitating custody arrangements by broker-dealers and relating to investment advisers\" sounds very bullish indeed; that's an area where I think we can expect to see a legitimate win that benefits all participants.  The SEC should be expected to seek legislation that enhances the oversight of trading, lending, and DeFi.  Hopefully we get some benefits without too much overreach.  \n\nFinally, I agree with the Chairman that standing astride isn't sustainable.

And it did so on rising volume. Ick. The must-hold level of the 10 Week is now at $37.8k. That cannot break again.\n* ETH is along for the ride as usual but I'm proud of it. I'd love to see healthy retests--that is, daily closes-- anywhere along the 100 Day (0.064), 10 Day (0.063), or 10 Week (0.062) over the next few sessions.\n\nFor other markets I'm literally just gonna update [my own post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ow7ugi/daily_general_discussion_august_2_2021/h7iai89?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) since they were basically flat, for better or worse.\n\n>Indices are down a little, with S&P 500 testing the 10 Day at 4388. All are still heavily overextended (even the 10 Week is down at 4320 where bears would have a shot at control). Neutral, maybe slightly near-term bearish.\r  \n>  \n>Yields... 10Y yields shattered downward through the 50 Week at 1.19 to end today at 1.175. I warned of this. This needs to recover and fast. Bearish. (will be Strongly Bearish if it ends the week near here.)\r  \n>  \n>Small caps (IWM) -- Wrapped today at 219.95 after three straight days of strongly getting rejected AGAIN off the 50 Day at 225 to close today under the 10 Day at 220. It is currently trading below the 10 Week now. 208 is the must-hold zone for bulls. Bearish, leading indicator.\r  \n>  \n>Bonds -- hooboy.\r  \n>  \n>TLT exploded off the 10 Day retest and closed at 150.67 to surge above the 50 Week MA for the first time since November 2020 before the bull run. 151 is THE resistance zone for this to break based on past volume, but it's ascending triangles all the way and Aug/Sept is bonds' time. 155 ish looks to be after that. Strongly bearish.\r  \n>  \n>TLH had the same daily movement, blasting off the 10 Day to end at 152.60. Its own major volume resistance zone is right above at 153. On the weekly, TLH has a little more to go, its 50 Week MA being 152.80. Bearish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Indices recovered off the 10 Week but with no new ATHs, they are flattening out. For crypto-focused eyes, it looks an awful lot like May 2021 BTC...\n* Yields - 10Y flat at 1.177 which keeps them in very bearish context. Near term bull case is that today was a green pin bar. It could slowly recover through the week until Friday's reporting (see endnote).\n* Small-caps (IWM) - recovered before EoD to 220.86 after an atrocious starting plunge to 217. Green pin bar back above the 10 Day. Same conclusion as yields above.\n* Bonds -- TLT and TLH both held flat at 150.75 and 152.73 respectively, with green spinning tops. Bullish uncertainty (for bonds), suggesting bearish uncertainty for equities and crypto.\n* I'll add in financial sector (XLF) closed green at 36.94 back above the 50 Day. Once again, someone prevents JP Morgan Chase from executing the most textbook head and shoulders you've ever seen. It's not out of the woods by a longshot, but pattern looks less likely by the day.\n\nI see near-term bearishness and uncertainty, while the market remains in indisputably bullish macro-context. No doom and gloom yet, just caution as I always say.\n\n\r\n\n>There's not a ton of fireworks this week in terms of earnings, after last week's reporting extravaganza. But I'll draw your eyes to non-farm employment reporting this Friday, bright and early 8:30am New York time.

The must-hold level of the 10 Week is now at $37.8k. That cannot break again.</li>\n<li>ETH is along for the ride as usual but I&#39;m proud of it. I&#39;d love to see healthy retests--that is, daily closes-- anywhere along the 100 Day (0.064), 10 Day (0.063), or 10 Week (0.062) over the next few sessions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For other markets I&#39;m literally just gonna update <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ow7ugi/daily_general_discussion_august_2_2021/h7iai89?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">my own post from yesterday</a> since they were basically flat, for better or worse.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Indices are down a little, with S&amp;P 500 testing the 10 Day at 4388. All are still heavily overextended (even the 10 Week is down at 4320 where bears would have a shot at control). Neutral, maybe slightly near-term bearish.</p>\n\n<p>Yields... 10Y yields shattered downward through the 50 Week at 1.19 to end today at 1.175. I warned of this. This needs to recover and fast. Bearish. (will be Strongly Bearish if it ends the week near here.)</p>\n\n<p>Small caps (IWM) -- Wrapped today at 219.95 after three straight days of strongly getting rejected AGAIN off the 50 Day at 225 to close today under the 10 Day at 220. It is currently trading below the 10 Week now. 208 is the must-hold zone for bulls. Bearish, leading indicator.</p>\n\n<p>Bonds -- hooboy.</p>\n\n<p>TLT exploded off the 10 Day retest and closed at 150.67 to surge above the 50 Week MA for the first time since November 2020 before the bull run. 151 is THE resistance zone for this to break based on past volume, but it&#39;s ascending triangles all the way and Aug/Sept is bonds&#39; time. 155 ish looks to be after that. Strongly bearish.</p>\n\n<p>TLH had the same daily movement, blasting off the 10 Day to end at 152.60. Its own major volume resistance zone is right above at 153. On the weekly, TLH has a little more to go, its 50 Week MA being 152.80. Bearish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Indices recovered off the 10 Week but with no new ATHs, they are flattening out. For crypto-focused eyes, it looks an awful lot like May 2021 BTC...</li>\n<li>Yields - 10Y flat at 1.177 which keeps them in very bearish context. Near term bull case is that today was a green pin bar. It could slowly recover through the week until Friday&#39;s reporting (see endnote).</li>\n<li>Small-caps (IWM) - recovered before EoD to 220.86 after an atrocious starting plunge to 217. Green pin bar back above the 10 Day. Same conclusion as yields above.</li>\n<li>Bonds -- TLT and TLH both held flat at 150.75 and 152.73 respectively, with green spinning tops. Bullish uncertainty (for bonds), suggesting bearish uncertainty for equities and crypto.</li>\n<li>I&#39;ll add in financial sector (XLF) closed green at 36.94 back above the 50 Day. Once again, someone prevents JP Morgan Chase from executing the most textbook head and shoulders you&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s not out of the woods by a longshot, but pattern looks less likely by the day.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I see near-term bearishness and uncertainty, while the market remains in indisputably bullish macro-context. No doom and gloom yet, just caution as I always say.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&#39;s not a ton of fireworks this week in terms of earnings, after last week&#39;s reporting extravaganza. But I&#39;ll draw your eyes to non-farm employment reporting this Friday, bright and early 8:30am New York time. Disappointing (or shocking) numbers there could absolutely serve as a catalyst for the classic August-September mini-bear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Stay hungry.
