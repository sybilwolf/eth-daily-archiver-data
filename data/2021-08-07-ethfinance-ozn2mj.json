The basic problem we're facing is that we expect more people to commit to going over time but we need to front the cost for some major expenses like an event planner and that's going to run us like 20-30k. If we wait for donations at the expected final price to roll in we won't have the money in time to do it. So, the consensus on the call was people were willing to drop in $2k now so we can proceed with booking and we would refund to anyone who had overcontributed after the event.\n\nHere's what we have planned to do with these funds:\n\n1) 2 Luau's. One near the start and one near the end.\n\n2) We're going to reserve the Aquariam the night of the second Saturday if it's available.\n\n3) We're reserving an all day social meet and greet location every day for people to rendezvous such as a pool cabana, reserving a gazebo/bandstand at a park, etc.\n\n4) A welcome cocktail event for early arrivers.\n\n5) Farewell brunch(es) at the end.\n\nSome of these events like the Aquarium and Luau's require down payments to reserve a block but participants still have to ticket individually using our group code (at a discount). For the cocktail party it's probably a reservation and will come with something like 2 drinks for admission so we meet their food and beverage minimum but you can buy as much as you want after that. Brunch will be something like a room fee but individual checks.\n\nOnto procedure. /u/getyourasstopluto bought the [hodlercon.eth ENS](https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=hodlercon.eth).\n\nWhile it appears he remains the controller, he has transferred the registration to our [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4B7e11d39DADc2ba05581BE382F9C07785C68eaB).\n\nKen, /u/bad_investment , and /u/logristhebard are the multi-sig holders. We will be maintaining a google sheet between us that pairs reddit accounts with deposit transactions so you can get credited for an eventual refund and for ticketing and distribution of group codes.\n\nWe are suggesting an initial deposit of $2k. I can't legally promise this but I expect the final price per person to be under $500. The more people who join in, the lower cost per person. Obviously we'll keep everyone informed of these expenses on the hodlercon planning calls.\n\nThis is how to make a deposit so we can do this awesome stuff, get credited for it on your reddit address, and avoid doxxing your assets.\n\n1) Ping one of us on reddit or discord with an amount you intend to deposit (we suggest $2k in some variety of stablecoin such as USDC).\n\n2) We'll respond with a dust value to attach to your transaction. Something like 0.42069. If you feel like being paranoid you can message the remaining multi-sig holders this dust value.\n\n3) Deposit your initial value + the dust value, e.g. 2000.42069 USDC. We recommend doing this as an exchange withdrawal to protect the privacy of your account.\n\n4) The dust number should be sufficient to uniquely identify your transaction so no one else can claim credit for your deposit. We have a timestamp of your message and a timestamp of the transaction so no one should be able to hop in and claim credit after the transaction. Just to be safe though, message us the transaction id of the deposit once it has been mined.\n\n5) We'll then add you to the spreadsheet and confirm with you.\n\nI also can't promise but I'll heavily imply there will be a reward such as an NFT for hodlercon early depositors who enable a memorable trip for everyone.\n\nWe'll review and discuss this procedure on the next planning call but it's been discussed and approved by the multi-sig at least.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I promised to write this out a few days ago but we need to go over the necessity and procedure for donating to the multi-sig for hodlercon.
