The floor was opened to any objections. \n3. Richard Shelby from AL objected to the amendment unless it was modified to include $50billion in military spending. \n4. Bernie Sanders objected to the modification. \n5. Without the modification, Shelby stood by his objection to the amendment, and it didn't pass. \n\nNext, Sen. Ted Cruz took the floor, gave some pretty real talk about how the Senate doesn't understand crypto, and suggested striking the broker definition completely until they could do more research and regulate properly. He warned against he potential dangers of passing such a mess. \n\n1. Cruz formally asked for a strike of the broker definition. \n2. The floor was opened to any objections. \n3. Richard Shelby from AL again objected, unless Cruz agreed to modify his request to include an additional $50billion in random military spending. \n4. Ted Cruz respectfully declined to modify, noting his support for the military, but basically telling Shelby he was delusional to think that his spending amendment would pass given was literally just happened 4 minutes ago. \n5.

Shelby didn't get his $50billion for the military, so now the crypto industry has to continue to wallow in uncertainty. \n\nI encourage anyone who didn't see the vote to go find a video of it. Toomy and Cruz were actually pretty frank and upfront about how bonkers this whole process is, and how little sense it makes that they couldn't fix it, and fix it NOW instead of cleaning up a huge mess later.

For larger targets >4,300 DYDX tiers, especially the highest tier, I've some further considerations:\n\n\\- Use limit orders instead, 0.05% maker fees vs 0.2% taker fees, but more importantly no slippage. Use the Limit tab and manually set your order size and price. Once your order fills, set the second order just above/below (depending on whether you go long or short).\n\n\\- Look for a good time to do it. For example, the dump post Senate vote was my opportunity, price rebounded quickly, so I ended up with a small profit where I went in expecting a cost.\n\n\\- Don't worry about gas, it's only going to be \\~$1 per gwei (so, if gas price is 20 gwei, it's $20) to get in and out, while the fees / loss from price slippage and movement can be thousands for the highest tier. So, if you find a good time to do it, go for it irrespective of gas.\n\n\\- Use 0.99x leverage, there's no liquidation risk. Just in case the price goes the opposite direction hard, you can be patient and wait it out till your limit order is hit without worry. (For those used to leverage, they can obviously go with a higher leverage, and that also means you'll hit your targets sooner. But for those of us who are scared shitless of leverage  - this may be helpful.) \n\ndYdX is a great experience. Zero gas fees\\*, instant confirmations - the experience is indistinguishable from a CEX, except you're using your wallet instead of trusting CZ or SBF. Indeed, I'd argue it's faster and more responsive, but I know that's because it's running at a smaller scale at this time. Post data shards, however, I believe dYdX will outcompete CEXs on all fronts.\n\n\\*Abstracted away from the user - the catch is minimum order size of 0.01 ETH.\n\nThe protocol finished last week with a total volume of $1.2B, with revenues of $1.5M. If Uniswap V3 had protocol fees switched on for \\~15%, that would be $3.7M. Bitcoin collected $3.5M in transaction fees. It's somewhere between Compound and Maker.

At least for me, I wasnt around for the ICO mania, at least not as close as I am today. For half an hour gas spikes to 1000 and then it comes down to 30. These spikes show the demand that is out there. Should you be part of it? Ill share my opinion later on. \n\nLets start with the dev/ artists/ project: I think some really take a lot of time to do crazy shit and build something new. There are some NFTs that really look great and that (from my very subjective opinion) really deserve the demand and thus returns. So how much do they make? To mint you usually have to go with something like 0.025-0.08 ETH. That means its 50$ to start (plus gas), can go up to 200-250$. Usually avatars dont mint for more than 0.1ETH, which makes sense cause of the psychological barrier. So 50$-100$ for a unique avatar sounds strange, but in the end its not like spending thousands on \"traditional\" art, more like buying a game. So the price is of course subjective, but imo its ok if you dont go for the ones starting at 0.07+. Lets assume the default is 10k NFTs. Lets go with the 0.025 ETH case, thats 40 mints / ETH for the devs or 250 ETH if they sell all. 800-1000 ETH if they sell for 0.8-0.999 ETH. Some projects were done within 24 hours (e.g. Blazed Cats, answer to the Stoner Cats launch some weeks ago).... 250 ETH within a week. I think that is just insane, because 10k doesnt feel like a lot, but 10k \\* 0.025 or 0.05 is just a huge amount. And again: I think this is cool, there is cost to do something like this and there of course is also the risk to of not selling at all. \n\nLets have a look at it from a user point of view: Why would you buy a profil pic for 50-250$? I think there are several reasons. You just might like your avatar. I think thats the best case actually, best case scenario is you will never sell your avatar and will use it every. See it as an add-on to your metamask wallet. Everywhere you use it as a login they will automatically add your avatar, see [one example --> zapper here](https://twitter.com/sebaudet26/status/1423844835509874693?s=20). Same goes for older SM/ applications like twitter, discord etc.    \nBut then of course you can try to invest in NFTs and/ or flip them. I think NFTs have the potential to be an \"up only\" market for some time, like defi summer last year. Very important. Its not up only forever. Just like altcoins I am rather sure there will be a bear and a lot of projects will go to (close to) 0 and communities will just disappear. So trying to make some money is an option. If you go for it, pick a one digit % of your portfolio to try NFTs. This is a casino, so dont gamble too hard. You will learn a lot, you might make money and of course airdrops are also an option (Open Sea, but also on other market places, there are some without tokens.   \nIn that case you should try to mint to be early, but try be aware of gas cost/ wars. Best case you are early and / or the project uses something like Open Sea to launch, hopefully soon more projects will launch on L2 and gas doesnt matter. In that case: pick something with community. Buy 2 or 3. One to keep, one or two to sell. Dont sell too early. Try to be break even and then ride the wave. Some NFTs double overnight = \"the floor\" --> lowest ask on e.g. Open Sea doubles from e.g. 0.025 to 0.05. Should you sell? You can, but if there is such a dynamic you can usually expect things to keep heating up. Its not crazy that a project has a 1 ETH floor and was launched like 2 weeks ago.

You can, but if there is such a dynamic you can usually expect things to keep heating up. Its not crazy that a project has a 1 ETH floor and was launched like 2 weeks ago.

At the same time, there may be some incredible adaptations to the NFT space that I\u2019m too dumb to come up with on my own so who knows what this idea will transform into. As of right now, I don\u2019t think virtual trading cards will hold their value.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-09 13:07:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h8br41m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p0upcl","parent_id":"t1_h8bloa6","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/tutamtumikia","body":"This is what you get with no regulation.

It's fair to say plasma is obsolete already, replaced by optimistic rollups, which in turn will also be obsolete by 2025, replaced by zkRollups. Raiden - I think they have some avenues to repurpose it as a cross-L2 solution, but zkRs also obsolete state channels as you can settle arbitrary number of transactions between a set of parties with a single signature. By 2025 we'll see zkRollups + data shards mature. If required, we can be up to 256 or so data shards by then, doing \\~500,000 TPS across all rollups. What I'd like to see is mature cross-L2 interop solutions by then. L1 would be fully stateless with state expiry, but still only do \\~200 TPS at most, although no one will care as we're all on rollups and related L2-like solutions.

It&#39;s fair to say plasma is obsolete already, replaced by optimistic rollups, which in turn will also be obsolete by 2025, replaced by zkRollups. Raiden - I think they have some avenues to repurpose it as a cross-L2 solution, but zkRs also obsolete state channels as you can settle arbitrary number of transactions between a set of parties with a single signature. By 2025 we&#39;ll see zkRollups + data shards mature. If required, we can be up to 256 or so data shards by then, doing ~500,000 TPS across all rollups. What I&#39;d like to see is mature cross-L2 interop solutions by then. L1 would be fully stateless with state expiry, but still only do ~200 TPS at most, although no one will care as we&#39;re all on rollups and related L2-like solutions.
