(Just for a moment consider mass adoption for P2E gaming) \n\nNow remember the insane buy pressure created by the tokenomics and the fact rewards / income for stakers is paid in ILV!!!!

If the cycle is still running up the merge will be wild. If it\u2019s already crashed 70% I think it\u2019ll pick it up, but who knows if it\u2019ll start a bull trend on its own.</p>\n\n<p>My ultimate hopium pipe dream is eth hits $20-$22k at what would normally be peak fomo in the cycle, then the merge hits at the same time to pump even harder and double it to $40-$50k before the next bear.</p>\n\n<p>Realistically, I think somewhere between $10-$18k is in the realm of possibility this time around, and agree that the market isn\u2019t really driven by fundamentals yet. Once the merge happens, that may get it there sooner, but until then BTC is running the market and if it shits the bed like it does every four years, I think it\u2019ll take eth with it for this cycle, and possibly the next.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-18 00:04:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h9du9p5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p6kicu","parent_id":"t1_h9doqqm","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/CaptLuLu","body":"Wasnt the previous cycle fueld by ico?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wasnt the previous cycle fueld by ico?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-17 23:03:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h9dq0fr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p6kicu","parent_id":"t1_h9doqqm","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Rhader","body":"No","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>No</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-17 23:26:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h9drlgm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p6kicu","parent_id":"t1_h9dm5ok","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/maotsetunginmyass","body":"$324","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$324</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-08-17 22:14:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"h9dmafk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p6kicu","parent_id":"t1_h9dm5ok","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/danarchist","body":"Near term *maybe* 2500 or for a split second slightly lower.
