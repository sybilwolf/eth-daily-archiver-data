Here was my response. Please be careful, I really don't want you to overdose on the hopium in this one.\n\n>No way. Ethereum is the next iteration of the internet. It is the internet's value layer and due to superior composability, security, neutrality and endless possibilities it will be the home of all finance one day. Everything from property deeds in real life to stocks and even fortnite skins. Ethereum will be the source of truth behind who owns what. The US stock market alone is worth $50 trillion dollars. Ethereum is worldwide and ETH is the underlying asset securing what one day will be hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of assets. Surely that would make it at least 1/10th of that value. Otherwise, you'd have far too much value on a network which isn't secure enough to keep track of so much value. You need to think of ETH as like an internet bond. Government bonds are worth hundreds of trillions of dollars worldwide. Well now you can get one which pays positive interest of more than 5% ( can drop but will always be above 2%) paid out in ETH, which itself can increase. Which it almost certainly will because ETH is being burned with every transaction and after ETH 2.0, more ETH will be being burned than is being newly created/inflated to pay for stakers. A deflationary monetary asset like this has never existed before and based on how most inflationary assets slowly decrease in value over time, ETH will likely only continue to grow as the opposing forces of an ever expanding network and an ever decreasing number of ETH cause the price to keep rising.\n\n>So do you think that an asset which will soon start decreasing in number, that will be the settlement layer for most of the world's value one day and can earn you yield is \"too late\" to buy because it has a market cap of just under $400 billion? If ETH sets out what it is well on track to achieve, it will be worth at least $10 trillion one day or about $100K/ETH (equivalent to the market cap of gold).

Here was my response. Please be careful, I really don&#39;t want you to overdose on the hopium in this one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>No way. Ethereum is the next iteration of the internet. It is the internet&#39;s value layer and due to superior composability, security, neutrality and endless possibilities it will be the home of all finance one day. Everything from property deeds in real life to stocks and even fortnite skins. Ethereum will be the source of truth behind who owns what. The US stock market alone is worth $50 trillion dollars. Ethereum is worldwide and ETH is the underlying asset securing what one day will be hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of assets. Surely that would make it at least 1/10th of that value. Otherwise, you&#39;d have far too much value on a network which isn&#39;t secure enough to keep track of so much value. You need to think of ETH as like an internet bond. Government bonds are worth hundreds of trillions of dollars worldwide. Well now you can get one which pays positive interest of more than 5% ( can drop but will always be above 2%) paid out in ETH, which itself can increase. Which it almost certainly will because ETH is being burned with every transaction and after ETH 2.0, more ETH will be being burned than is being newly created/inflated to pay for stakers. A deflationary monetary asset like this has never existed before and based on how most inflationary assets slowly decrease in value over time, ETH will likely only continue to grow as the opposing forces of an ever expanding network and an ever decreasing number of ETH cause the price to keep rising.</p>\n\n<p>So do you think that an asset which will soon start decreasing in number, that will be the settlement layer for most of the world&#39;s value one day and can earn you yield is &quot;too late&quot; to buy because it has a market cap of just under $400 billion?
