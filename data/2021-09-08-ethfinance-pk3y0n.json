The first part is called the base fee and it is paid by everyone. It varies according to the network demand and increases during periods of peak usage like when a new NFT is released. It drops back down when network demand decreases. This base fee amount is burned resulting in Ether being destroyed, never to be seen again. Since the London hardfork almost 800 million US worth of Eth has been destroyed. You can see the results of EIP1559 here: \nhttps://watchtheburn.com\nBefore EIP1559 this base fee was paid to the miners. \n\nThe second part of the transaction fee is known as the Tip. This is not paid by everyone and is a tip offered by users to the miners to include their transaction in the latest block. The higher the tip offered the more likely that the transaction gets processed into the blockchain. \n\nTips are particularly important during times of heavy network usage and some uses have been offering incredibly high tips during the release of new and highly sort after NFT projects. These tips are paid directly to the miners. After the Merge the tips offered will all go the people who are staking their Eth and miners will get nothing and cease to exist. \n\nIt is important to realise that the volume of tips will vary depending on just how motivated people are to have their transactions go to the front of the queue and hence the yield on staking after the merge will vary and is essentially unknown. \n\nAll you can say for certain is that the staking yield will be higher than the current rate of 5.5%. \n\nSo essentially the decision to stake is a bet that the overall demand for the Ethereum Network will continue to increase and people who stake will be the beneficiaries of that increased demand. \n\nQuite apart from the monetary advantages of staking, the bigger picture is that you will be adding to the decentralised strength of the Ethereum Network. \n\nSo that is what Staking is all about.

This might be the straw that broke the camels back because crypto st that point was experimental and nothing was guaranteed. Only a small portion managed to hodl at this point. Then the market decided to give the middle finger to all the weak hands and pumped straight to $1400.</p>\n\n<p>How many Herculean challenges must we face this bull run before 20k?

I've thought more about this and obviously also got more input. So I'll try write down my thoughts why I think a bear at some point is inevitable and will also try to explain why I think it will hit harder than we expect. \n\nBack then my main reason was: If we go 3x to 5x from here this will make a lot of coins and tokens incredibly valuable. Even products without usage, users, revenues, etc. Just to give you an idea. ADA 5x from here would be ETHs mcap right now. And I guess I dont need to elaborate this or compare these two here. So reason 1: if the whole market goes up, there will be a huge disconnect between speculation and the fundamentals. \n\nOn top I expect the peak to be a blow off top, possibly caused by the merge. If that happens the most bullish event in ETHs history could be the start of the bear market. Why? Well, we all know about the squishchaos paper predicting 150k/ETH until 2023 that also started the \"tripple halvening meme\". The described supply shock would obviously be a reason for a blow off top. Will ETH make it to 150k? I dont think so. Do we need 150k to drop hard afterwards, cause people will take profits? No! There's also the argument by Raoul Pal in the latest bankless podcast that a lot of institutions buy ETH now but will sell once the merge happens making it a \"sell the news\" event. We all have to understand that not all investors are in for the tech or longterm investors, but will take profits whenever they can. The higher the blow off top, the more likely we will see a 80% correction. \n\nA very important thing is that we have a lot of stable coins right now. Taking profit doesnt mean converting to FIAT. In 2018 there was only tether and FUD was everywhere. Would I have swapped for tether back then? Hell no! This time its incredibly easy to take profits and stay within the ecosystem. Since its so much easier to sell the top, more people will do it (and please dont get me wrong, they will obviously not all sell the top). \n\nThis is also the reason why the 4 year cycle might be a self fulfilling prophecy. I dont believe in the supercycle in terms of (less) price volatility (p.s. actually zhu su explained in some podcast that his supercycle term isnt so much about the $ value). I believe that experienced people will sell to take profits. This means institutions, but also crypto OGs. You always have to remember that some people on CT are whales. And they are rich already, but they will play this game one more time if that makes them richer. They dont know if there will be a 4 year cycle, but if there are signs that the market crashes they will not sit in spot and ride down. Btw: I dont believe that history repeats, but that it rhymes. In this case I think the cycle might be a bit longer than in 2017/2018, but more like months, not years. \n\nThese are the reasons why there will be bear market. Now why will it be another 80% correction?\n\nFirst of all we just witnessed a 60% correction. You think we can survive a 60% and continue the bull and during a bear market it will be 50-60% max? I dont think so. One of the reasons of course is that some coins / tokens will be so overvalued that a 80% correction is necessary and I guess that applies to 99% of the market. \n\nBut there are more specific things that could happen that would lead to a huge correction. Some the following things are assumptions or speculations if you will. I will try to explain my thoughts anyways, just as an extreme argument so people make up their own minds. \n\n1. If (and thats obivously a big if, or maybe for some it isnt, but you get the point) ETH flips BTC the aftermath is a huge ???. There are some scenarios.   \n\\- ETH flip BTC for some hours/ days, but BTC flips back   \n\\- ETH flips BTC for weeks   \n\\- ETH flip BTC forever  \nI think especially the second and third case could cause some insecurity in the market. People dont expect this to happen, they were told BTC is king and will be. So even though the mcap KPI is stupid (and doesnt play a role in stocks, no one really cares if apple or tesla is number 1) the narrative could change drastically crashing the market harder than we expect. \n2. Lets assume the bear will also be similar (as in: not a copy, but comparable) to the previous cycles. This would mean that there will be less activity. This will lead to lower fees. Now thats great? Except maybe it isnt, at least from a narrative point of view. ETH has been building the ultra sound money meme. Now what happens if fees go down and despite lower issuance of PoS there is still a net issuance and the burned fees cant cover staking rewards? This could get worse once sharding goes live (and obviously we dont know when this will happen). Dont get me wrong, I am not saying this **will** happen and also dont know how likely this is. If it happens its most likely a temporary thing, but this could be one of the things that drag us down harder than we could imagine. \n\nI am not going to discuss FUD here. Neither am I going to talk about manipulation. I guess both things will happen, but in which form, to which extend, etc. etc. is so hard to predict that it doesnt make any sense (at least for me) to discuss them here. \n\nAm I a bear now? Hell no! Still bullish. I expect the rallye to continue for at least 6 more months. The merge is the event to look out for. I believe in 10k+ ETH. I even prepare for crazy shit during the blow off top. \n\nSo why do I write all this bearish stuff down? \n\n1. to structure my thoughts\n2. to be able to evaluate later on if my assumptions were just remotely correct (and I guess they wont be, ill be off most likely, cause you cant predict crypto, but still I see some value for myself writing all of this down)\n3. to share my thoughts with you and get new input\n4. to share my thoughts with you, so you get new input and think about scenarios that could happen in the future and how to manage them. \n\nThat's it for now. maybe ill pick this post up regularly to extend stuff. depends on you as well. looking forward to feedback.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I was asked some time ago if and why I think there will be a new bear soon. I&#39;ve thought more about this and obviously also got more input. So I&#39;ll try write down my thoughts why I think a bear at some point is inevitable and will also try to explain why I think it will hit harder than we expect. </p>\n\n<p>Back then my main reason was: If we go 3x to 5x from here this will make a lot of coins and tokens incredibly valuable. Even products without usage, users, revenues, etc. Just to give you an idea. ADA 5x from here would be ETHs mcap right now. And I guess I dont need to elaborate this or compare these two here. So reason 1: if the whole market goes up, there will be a huge disconnect between speculation and the fundamentals. </p>\n\n<p>On top I expect the peak to be a blow off top, possibly caused by the merge. If that happens the most bullish event in ETHs history could be the start of the bear market. Why? Well, we all know about the squishchaos paper predicting 150k/ETH until 2023 that also started the &quot;tripple halvening meme&quot;. The described supply shock would obviously be a reason for a blow off top. Will ETH make it to 150k? I dont think so. Do we need 150k to drop hard afterwards, cause people will take profits? No! There&#39;s also the argument by Raoul Pal in the latest bankless podcast that a lot of institutions buy ETH now but will sell once the merge happens making it a &quot;sell the news&quot; event. We all have to understand that not all investors are in for the tech or longterm investors, but will take profits whenever they can. The higher the blow off top, the more likely we will see a 80% correction. </p>\n\n<p>A very important thing is that we have a lot of stable coins right now. Taking profit doesnt mean converting to FIAT. In 2018 there was only tether and FUD was everywhere. Would I have swapped for tether back then? Hell no! This time its incredibly easy to take profits and stay within the ecosystem. Since its so much easier to sell the top, more people will do it (and please dont get me wrong, they will obviously not all sell the top). </p>\n\n<p>This is also the reason why the 4 year cycle might be a self fulfilling prophecy. I dont believe in the supercycle in terms of (less) price volatility (p.s. actually zhu su explained in some podcast that his supercycle term isnt so much about the $ value). I believe that experienced people will sell to take profits. This means institutions, but also crypto OGs. You always have to remember that some people on CT are whales. And they are rich already, but they will play this game one more time if that makes them richer. They dont know if there will be a 4 year cycle, but if there are signs that the market crashes they will not sit in spot and ride down. Btw: I dont believe that history repeats, but that it rhymes. In this case I think the cycle might be a bit longer than in 2017/2018, but more like months, not years. </p>\n\n<p>These are the reasons why there will be bear market. Now why will it be another 80% correction?</p>\n\n<p>First of all we just witnessed a 60% correction. You think we can survive a 60% and continue the bull and during a bear market it will be 50-60% max? I dont think so. One of the reasons of course is that some coins / tokens will be so overvalued that a 80% correction is necessary and I guess that applies to 99% of the market. </p>\n\n<p>But there are more specific things that could happen that would lead to a huge correction. Some the following things are assumptions or speculations if you will. I will try to explain my thoughts anyways, just as an extreme argument so people make up their own minds. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If (and thats obivously a big if, or maybe for some it isnt, but you get the point) ETH flips BTC the aftermath is a huge ???. There are some scenarios.<br/>\n- ETH flip BTC for some hours/ days, but BTC flips back<br/>\n- ETH flips BTC for weeks<br/>\n- ETH flip BTC forever<br/>\nI think especially the second and third case could cause some insecurity in the market. People dont expect this to happen, they were told BTC is king and will be. So even though the mcap KPI is stupid (and doesnt play a role in stocks, no one really cares if apple or tesla is number 1) the narrative could change drastically crashing the market harder than we expect. </li>\n<li>Lets assume the bear will also be similar (as in: not a copy, but comparable) to the previous cycles. This would mean that there will be less activity. This will lead to lower fees. Now thats great? Except maybe it isnt, at least from a narrative point of view.

Some 4, some 140 (ie Bitcoin). But if the distribution is tied to your stake (as is the case in ILV or FST for example, to give some concrete examples), you have additional options.\n\nSo let's say a theoretical token has a 10 year distribution schedule (max supply 10K).
