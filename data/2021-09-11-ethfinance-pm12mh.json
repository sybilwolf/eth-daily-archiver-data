Many of you know that I made it my personal mission to do whatever I could to improve the health of the Ethereum Beacon chain (\"Eth 2\") by engaging the community in best practice related to staking.\n\nIf you REALLY value Ethereum, you'll realize that your staking APR isn't the most important thing, the most important thing is that you stake in ways the promote network health - this will cause the underlying asset (Ether) to appreciate over the long term - that's the big win.\n\nThe most obvious things you can do to support this cause are:\n\n* If you are able to solo stake, stake with a minority beacon chain client. This means choosing teku, lighthouse, or nimbus instead of Prysm. There is NOTHING wrong with Prysm, it's a great client - but they're all great and we can't thrive when 70%+ of the network runs one client.\n\n* If you don't have 32 Ether, or you can't solo stake, make the most responsible choice you can when staking - choose a provider that decentralizes the network and uses minority clients. Rocket Pool is launching October 6, and while I do urge caution before participating, it has the potential to be very beneficial for the health of the network. If you choose a different provider, reach out to them to urge them to use a minority client. They'll listen when enough people make noise!\n\nAre you still here? There's one more thing you can do. I have never been pushy about gitcoin grants, but now we have a clear mission for the grant funds we receive - the funds will go toward developing and auditing GUI staking solutions - these will evolve to support Windows and beacon chain client switching.

The first are community membership NFT's. These confer membership, status, and serve as a proxy of a value system espoused by the creators. This encompasses everything from punks to mutant cats. The creators of these collections put out a community manifesto, provide some art to add some relative desirability, and offer these tokens on a first-come first-serve basis. Gas bidding wars erupt as people scramble to join to this new community. ETH goes up in flames, miners rejoice, and a new community is forged from the fire, standing atop the dying embers of the ETH sacrificed on the pyre. Little to none of the value used in the ritual is retained for the community itself. The long term value these of NFT's is based on the behavior of that community as a whole and how desirable membership remains. Some confer benefits, some do not. The only incentive of these NFT's is to hold and spread the memetic desire to others. As prices become... *tempting*... members reveal their commitment to that community by the money they forego by holding. As the price of punks rises, they become more of a statement of how much you want to belong to a group, rather than a personalized representation of what you have done.\n\nThe second type of collection is not gated by scarcity of supply but rather by prerequisite action. I've already mentioned the Zapper and Alchemix NFT's as examples of this but POAP's are a more common one. These are designed by their creator to reward behavior. POAP's are used to reward event attendance or participation. More recently POAP Delivery is used to reward some historical behavior, from some csv file, sometimes even derived from on chain behavior.\n\nI predict we're going to see more NFT's that are not just retrospective but are gamed to incentivize ongoing/future behavior like the Zapper NFT's that represent some pattern in your address history. Gitcoin grants could launch an NFT that can be claimed by anyone who donated to each previous grant round. Uniswap could create an NFT (instead of liquidity mining) for people who migrate liquidity to the Arbitrum-One pool. Some of these may have time cutoffs to create urgency, or specifically incentivize people until a situation resolves itself such as the Alchemix red carpet NFT. Alchemix looks to be planning to create rpg item NFT's for DAO participants. Zapper is working on a crafting system for their next quest round. These systems are going to become more gamified and more prevalent because they are more *economically efficient* at incentivizing behavior. What we have right now as an ecosystem in this regard is a bunch of ad hoc attempts unified only by their NFT status.\n\nIt's somewhat ironic that this type collectable is represented as an NFT. When a thing can simply be purchased it also loses something. It loses some of its' significance, its' provenance. There is absolutely something different about a collectable that was personally acquired by the investment of your time versus a collectable that was acquired with money that was earned by an investment of the same time. When something is not for sale it can be both more personal and more egalitarian. It's *how* a collectable was earned rather than mere *possession*. \n\nI'll echo a [poetic sentiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nhkhwb/daily_general_discussion_may_21_2021/gyww2s1/) I wrote about hodlercon earlier this year.\n\n>So you know how you feel when you get to the top of a hike and you see another stranger at the top? That's how it's going to feel meeting ethfinanciers in Hawaii. You'll respect the people you meet for having gone through what you have gone through. You're going to look back on days like Wednesday and feel a combination of pride and mutual culture and history. We may have all taken different flights, walked different paths, but we've all traveled the same journey.\n\n(yes I quoted myself; I'm that pretentious.)\n\nThis is what NFT's lose by virtue of being tradable, the provenance of their origin, the respect of the journey. If the EIP-1559 NFT was meant to define a community that supported EIP-1559 development does it really do that if you own it second-hand? The very thing that unifies these collectables and provides a visualization layer for them, their ERC-721 contract, actually sacrifices part of their utility. While all blockchain history is public and provenance can inferred off-chain using indexes like Alchemy API, possession of NFTs can't be used on-chain by contracts as proof of previous behavior because they can be transferred. To me that seems like a waste... and an opportunity.\n\nMore to come tomorrow.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Follow up from my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pleg2a/daily_general_discussion_september_10_2021/hca6q3z/\">previous post</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So let&#39;s have a look at where we are right now in NFT evolution.</p>\n\n<p>At present I see two main categories of collections taking off.
