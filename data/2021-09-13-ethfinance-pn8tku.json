If on the other hand the tech gets better and ETH is unable to change any time soon and we just wave our hands and say L2 is already fast enough and good luck challenging our market share, then IMO we&#39;re just fancy bitcoiners. L2 doesn&#39;t step over L1 entirely, in a sense it magnifies its power, so a better L1 means a better L2, with real world consequences when transaction demand gets <em>really</em> high. In this scenario I like to think I bite the bullet and start rooting for the competition, I don&#39;t want the future to be built on inferior technology. Thankfully, by my standards and as far as I&#39;m aware, Ethereum is still the best L1, I refuse to change sides while this is still the case, token prices be damned.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-13 15:50:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hcr0kfp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pn8tku","parent_id":"t1_hcqufmg","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SwagtimusPrime","body":"I agree, but that's also pretty much what I'm pointing out.

On the other hand, I kind of feel like there is an amount of hash power or staking value below which <em>in reality</em> it doesn&#39;t matter. Like, under PoW, I <em>could</em> mine with a basic GPU but in reality, it&#39;s pretty irrelevant to network security. Or I could stake 0.1 ETH but again, it&#39;s pretty irrelevant. (But I guess in a way this is an argument that supports DPoS.) Maybe 32 ETH combined with something like Rocketpool is a good compromise (superior to DPoS).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: so in short, yeah, I think there is spectrum! :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-13 09:41:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hcpjd4m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pn8tku","parent_id":"t1_hcpdr53","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Whovillage","body":"Thanks for the replies!
