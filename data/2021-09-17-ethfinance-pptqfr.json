a topic which is bugging me since a few weeks which will become very relevant after the merge. It's about tips and the distribution of them after the merge. \n\nTo make more than just educated guesses I dug for some numbers [here](https://gz.blockchair.com/ethereum/blocks/).\n\nSince the implementation of 1559 we had 268357 blocks (stand at midnight, don't know which time zone).\n\nIn this time there were 104850 ETH tipped within 42 days. If we do the calculation with 500k validators after the merge it'd be 1.82 ETH per validator per year if we use even distribution.\n\nAverage tip per block is 0.39 ETH\n\nMedian tip per block is 0.13 ETH\n\nThis is already quite a discrepancy which we know from TradFi and leads to concetration of power. Now, I'm aware that PoS is intrinsically leading to a more uneven distribution over time, and I do not have a solution for that either, but I think we should do the best to keep the distribution as even as possible. Espescially regarding the very high tips we saw sometimes in the past weeks and the higher chance that an entity with multiple validators will catch such a tip and grow their advantage even faster and further.\n\nFor that some additional numbers:\n\n3% of the blocks (8006) had more than 1 ETH tipped. These 8006 blocks contain 54% of all ETH tipped.\n\n1.18% of the blocks (3184) had more than 2 ETH tip. These 3184 blocks contain 48.1% of all ETH tipped\n\nThe 1000 blocks with the highest tip contain 38857 ETH tipped, which is 37% of all tips.\n\nIf we distribute the tips over all attestators instead of just the validator of the block, we'll sese already a split which is 100 times fairer (assuming 100 attestators per block) over the status quo.\n\nI don't know exactly how many validations per validator and year are expected with 500k validators (10?), but there is, and I repeat myself here, a risk of concentration of power at a much faster rate than expected, than with an evenly distributed network.

Opinions are highly welcomed","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There&#39;s a topic which is bugging me since a few weeks which will become very relevant after the merge. It&#39;s about tips and the distribution of them after the merge. </p>\n\n<p>To make more than just educated guesses I dug for some numbers <a href=\"https://gz.blockchair.com/ethereum/blocks/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the implementation of 1559 we had 268357 blocks (stand at midnight, don&#39;t know which time zone).</p>\n\n<p>In this time there were 104850 ETH tipped within 42 days. If we do the calculation with 500k validators after the merge it&#39;d be 1.82 ETH per validator per year if we use even distribution.</p>\n\n<p>Average tip per block is 0.39 ETH</p>\n\n<p>Median tip per block is 0.13 ETH</p>\n\n<p>This is already quite a discrepancy which we know from TradFi and leads to concetration of power. Now, I&#39;m aware that PoS is intrinsically leading to a more uneven distribution over time, and I do not have a solution for that either, but I think we should do the best to keep the distribution as even as possible. Espescially regarding the very high tips we saw sometimes in the past weeks and the higher chance that an entity with multiple validators will catch such a tip and grow their advantage even faster and further.</p>\n\n<p>For that some additional numbers:</p>\n\n<p>3% of the blocks (8006) had more than 1 ETH tipped. These 8006 blocks contain 54% of all ETH tipped.</p>\n\n<p>1.18% of the blocks (3184) had more than 2 ETH tip. These 3184 blocks contain 48.1% of all ETH tipped</p>\n\n<p>The 1000 blocks with the highest tip contain 38857 ETH tipped, which is 37% of all tips.</p>\n\n<p>If we distribute the tips over all attestators instead of just the validator of the block, we&#39;ll sese already a split which is 100 times fairer (assuming 100 attestators per block) over the status quo.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know exactly how many validations per validator and year are expected with 500k validators (10?), but there is, and I repeat myself here, a risk of concentration of power at a much faster rate than expected, than with an evenly distributed network.

And in bear markets selling calls is significantly more profitable than trying to sell an ever decreasing stream of tokens that are in of themselves losing value (i.e. farming). That's why it's arguably more sustainable over long time frames.\n\n> Why do you need high options volume in crypto?\n\nSame reason you want them in any markets. They are great for hedging strategies and restructuring risk. Also gamblers fucking love them. They've gotten so big in tradfi markets [that the tail wags the dog](https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The_Implied_Order_Book.pdf), so yah I think we have some room to grow in crypto. Why exactly do you think they wouldn't grow?\n\n>It also seems pretty centralized - they excluded me from the airdrop despite checking almost all boxes - had deposited, was active in Discord early\n\nFor the Discord drop, you needed 5+ discord messages & needed to fill out a form with your address. For the other platform user airdops, you needed at least a $100 deposit. Did you meet these criteria? If yes I would reach out in the discord, because I'm sure they would help you out if you were somehow missed in error.\n\nI will say it's fair to say the initial v1 had centralization issues. Strike prices were set manually, and only selected market makers could buy the contracts OTC, but these issues have been addressed in v2.\n\n>I don't see why anyone else (e.g. Yearn or other options platforms) won't set up competing options vaults and dilute their already small market. \n\nYearn likes products that are \"risk free\" in the sense that they can guarantee no loss. You are effectively selling risk when you sell puts/calls so it's not really they type of vault they're interested in.

And in bear markets selling calls is significantly more profitable than trying to sell an ever decreasing stream of tokens that are in of themselves losing value (i.e. farming). That&#39;s why it&#39;s arguably more sustainable over long time frames.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why do you need high options volume in crypto?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Same reason you want them in any markets. They are great for hedging strategies and restructuring risk. Also gamblers fucking love them. They&#39;ve gotten so big in tradfi markets <a href=\"https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The_Implied_Order_Book.pdf\">that the tail wags the dog</a>, so yah I think we have some room to grow in crypto.

For the other platform user airdops, you needed at least a $100 deposit. Did you meet these criteria? If yes I would reach out in the discord, because I&#39;m sure they would help you out if you were somehow missed in error.</p>\n\n<p>I will say it&#39;s fair to say the initial v1 had centralization issues.
