This time of year, strong sideways movement and building long-term support is the game and ETH is playing it well.\n* BTC - Hinting at a dominance [double bottom at the weekly level](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ojsUUWZz/). Considering it's riiiight about now through much of Q4 that BTC likes to make moves, we're entering some pivotal weeks. Speaking of pivotal, I drew a shitty JPEG fractal chart thing the other day as a laugh. But here's the actual fractal chart and damn if I don't say [48,500 might be the most important number](https://i.imgur.com/NqgEOdt.png) in the entire crypto market. That's the bottom of the rightside red box. Break it, hold it, invalidate the pattern, and I think it soars.\n\nequities et al\n\nWell, we survived the Q3 quadruple witching. Here's the aftermath.\n\n* S&P 500 (4432.98) closed the day just below the famous 50 Day MA, [shown here as the blue urethra.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LP37D54U/) You can see better what I'm talking about [here.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/jkYd3rSm/) I just really wanted that previous image saved. Anyway, it's done it many times before in this bull penis run. It's bounced right back every time. This drop was a little different in that it was gradual and plentiful with the day-to-day volatility that shook out traders. Suffice it to say, the 50D MA line is weaker than it's ever been this run but this market is still crazy macro bullish. So be cautious but don't be sad yet. The range is 4490 for bulls to reclaim and next support is 4350 for bears to solidify their reign.\n* Nasdaq 100 (15333) also closed below its 20D MA, but is not yet at the 50D @ 15167 or so.\n* Dow Jones (34584) also closed below its 50D Ma for the seventh consecutive session, amid rapidly declining 10D MA and lower BBand.\n* Small caps IWM (222.48) played while the bigger indices disappointed. Investors eking out growth while blue chips flounder? It's been ranging all year long. Closed a (red) bull hammer just below the 10W (and also higher 20W).\n* DXY (93.246) reacted accordingly to falling markets, breaking out ABOVE a daily ascending wedge to close AT the weekly high, something it hasn't done since at least arguably mid June 2020 or, really, early February 2020. Higher low confirmed at the weekly level is bullish for fiat and sends headwinds toward crypto and equities. But the dollar is mostly reactionary/derivative. A good Monday on Wall Street can quickly undo all this.\n* Bonds (TLH 150.84 / TLT 149.17) both ended unusually flat or down, not reacting to down markets like usual. Could be a sign that stocks will bounce next week. The 20y (TLT) did see a bullish cross, its 10W going above the 50W for the first time since November 2020. \n* 10Y Yields (1.369) ended in a nice green bull hammer after bouncing off the 10W.\n* Financials XLF (37.58) sputtered to a red close just below the 10W MA while bouncing from the 20W. Banks can perform even during corrections (if one were to happen) but this is still weak action.\n* Energy XLE (49.32) brightened with a green, albeit long-wicked candle closing just above its 10W but still a ways from the 20W. I've called it the bellwether, but it's doing no deciding this week. Could be a dead cat or a revival. More data needed.\n* Gold (1753.40) is crypto's boomer buddy and looks straight poor. It collapsed below all mid-term MAs and set a weekly lower low to rest at a supply level support. Next low is around 1680.\n* VIX volatility (20.80) - I warned it could be a sticky icky vicky (VIXy?) this time of year. Closed a second straight week in a bullish candle above the nasty 20 level where volatility starts to really build and send markets down. It's also a second straight weekly close above the 50W MA, suggesting volatility on a MACRO scale is returning to the markets. Last time it did this was before the Oct 2020 correction. If VIX starts tickling 22 or 24, you'll likely know that markets are heading for correction territory.\n\ncalendar\n\n* Wednesday is the day. 9/22.\n   * FOMC Economic Projections and Fed Interest Rate Decision come out at 2pm NYC time.\n   * The press conference follows at 2:30pm.\n   * This is an enormous meeting. It can't be understated. We're now in the window where Wall Street is openly EXPECTING tapering decisions, meaning Powell is running out of time to call it. It's less likely here in September, but possible. They could also announce that it'll start in November, and that would constitute news. Wednesday could determine what the rest of 2021 looks like.\n   * Powell also speaks Friday at 10am NYC. Join me for a drinking game where we take a shot every time he says \"transitory\".\n\nunsolicited speculation\n\nThere's been a joke for months now renaming the S&P 500 to the S&P 5. It's been propped up by the FANMAG companies all of 2021. The divergence in terms of which S&P companies are above their 50D MAs compared to those not is astounding. And so, with Microsoft and Apple both taking 2% drops yesterday; with Amazon dead-catting back up and getting rejected down another percent... I'm at maximum level cautious, while still bullish.\n\nCheers!
