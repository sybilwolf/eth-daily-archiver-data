All designs have tradeoffs though. Most people don't know the underlying constraints well enough to determine what trade-offs are being made. Unless there are some new breakthroughs in the foundational approaches, then I am a firm believer that most scaling will end up being towards an L2 in some fashion, with value and security accruing in a suitable L1.

Ask yourself -- why are they afraid? Who is afraid? </p>\n\n<p>L1s right now have stolen the spotlight from NFTs (sort-of, maybe my own wishful thinking). In my opinion, no one is even close to Ethereum right now in understanding the science of scaling a blockchain. Don&#39;t get me wrong, we are seeing a lot of new and novel approaches. All designs have tradeoffs though. Most people don&#39;t know the underlying constraints well enough to determine what trade-offs are being made. Unless there are some new breakthroughs in the foundational approaches, then I am a firm believer that most scaling will end up being towards an L2 in some fashion, with value and security accruing in a suitable L1. Ethereum is so far ahead in this area that we are solving problems that other chains aren&#39;t even needing to think about yet. There are some growing pains right now, but they will pass, and will create entry opportunities in the meantime.</p>\n\n<p>If days like today scare you or make you anxious, then I would encourage you to continue reading and learning. If you stick around long enough and have conviction, you might just find the red days are more exciting than the green days. No other time in my crypto journey have I felt more strongly that I still don&#39;t hold enough ETH -- and I am hoping that September can give me some more time to DCA heavily with favorable prices before the merge.</p>\n\n<p>Wrote more than I expected.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: I feel strongly (hope strongly) that September is going to be a good time to accumulate. Red days are exciting if you have conviction in ETH. You are all great people, and this is my favorite place on Reddit. Hope you had a great day!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-20 19:52:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hdo9oss","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pro1m2","parent_id":"t3_pro1m2","score":36,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Lol, I didn't even notice the blood on the streets.
