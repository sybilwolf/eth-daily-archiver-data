It was a NECESSARY relief, but by no means definitive. You look at a chart higher than a 2-Hour and tell me it's bullish, I'll tell you you're delusional. This was a GREAT move, but it is just step 1 ladies and gentlemen. Clearing 45k again is the big one -- it was a major support and supply zone in both Feb and Aug. And the daily MAs are quickly racing to move under it, meaning recovery above is a race against time before those can start pushing price down again.\n* ETH is continuing its (successful) test against the downtrend line, bouncing up from 0.067 to head back above the 0.07 and the 38.2 fib line that extends back to the '17/'18 market. Not much to say except that ETH is along for the ride right now as stocks and BTC decide what to do and it's riding well.\n\nnews/speculation\n\n* Evergrande - Paid their Chinese debts... maybe. Reports are that they settled $70mm off-market which to me sounds like defaulting but with extra steps in order to save face with the CCP. Purportedly they still owe $80+ mm in USD debt coupons today, which will officially default in 30 days and $600mm by EoY. I think this is mostly behind us but it's the kind of thing that can come roaring back.\n* Federal Reserve, in two parts\n   * As expected, no tapering scheme was announced today but Powell has said that inflation has met their quota to begin tapering and that the jobs market is 60% or so there. He said next that a good, but not even necessarily great Sept jobs report (release next month) would confirm a November start to tapering. Similarly, Powell candidly said it'll be about a six-month taper ending sometime mid-2022.\n   * My take? I think due to either the protracted length at which these tapering talks went on or -- and I can't believe I'm about to say this -- the deftness with which Powell slowly revealed their plans, tapering will be a minor issue going forward. Everyone and their mother's brother's pet komodo dragon now knows to expect November, or at latest December. It's for the most part priced in.\n   * New news was that the Fed governors have indeed begun moving up the interest rate hike schedule in discussions. So forget the Tapering and get ready for The Liftoff. Where no governors prior to today wanted a 2022 start, now half want at least one rate hike in 2022. Meanwhile a solid majority want 2-3 in 2023. And we got our first look at 2024 in today's dot-plot as well. Expecting 6-7 hikes through 2024 as of now. This puts quite a big brake in front of the global bull market and sooner than we might think. Though a first hike likely won't come until EoY 2022, that's still a very concrete-ish timeframe in which the market will likely need a breather as lending becomes more expensive. Crypto will follow, although frankly no one here expects the supercycle to go much beyond next summer anyway. Food for thought.\n* Debt ceiling... it's impossible to do this without politics, but I'll try. We gotta raise the debt ceiling or else the United States of America defaults on its international credit. It would destroy every financial market on Earth for weeks until a budget could be put in place. The Republican leader says they will vote no to raising it or suspending it. The Democrats are missing two key centrist obstructive members of their caucus who could get them past this by killing an antiquated political process known as \"filibustering\". The vote needs to happen by October 1st, so 8 days. We've never defaulted in 30 years of this negotiating. But these are strange times.\n\ntrad markets\n\nI made a typo the other day in regards to filling the gap caused by the Monday drop where I said the gap fill starts at 4410 on the S&P 500. This was a mistake. I was reading from the SPY chart, an easier to read ETF proxy for the S&P, where the gap is at 441. But they aren't exactly 10x apart so the S&P gap actually begins at 4430 or so. We have not filled either, obviously. I'm gonna use the SPY from now on with smaller numbers and best estimates. Easier to write.\n\n* SPY (438) - Like BTC by no means can you call this chart bullish. It's in a downtrend. As well there's nothing to suggest today's relief was anything but a dead cat so far, until the gap at 441 is filled. Even then, it could go right back down as part of a bull trap. For TA guys, it's a clear ascending wedge on the daily. Or a bear flag, if you count the Monday gapdown. And with today's close back above the lower Bollinger band, it means we no longer have the magnetism to protect from a further drop. Be careful. In case of further relief, eyes on that gap fill at 441 and if it can close above the pre-dump candle at 445. Otherwise, we've got 432 (100 Day), 425 (July low), and 410 (200D) below.\n* Dollar DXY (93.30) - Strong amid the Fed talk but so far rejected from the 100 Week MA at 93.50. It's clear skies above that so watch for the Friday close as that would be bearish for markets.\n* Small caps IWM (220.90) - The little index that could. I've made fun of it for months because it barely moved but in a Dickensian twist, it's the lack of movement in small caps that is SAVING the other indices somewhat. After all, a rejection of a dump is a form of strength. It's just below its 100 Day and setting higher lows. A breakout above 223 or so would likely lead other large indices out of this dip with strength. It should not breakdown below 217 however.\n* Bonds - Both TLT and TLH are breaking out and still within their upward expanding Bbands. Like the DXY, there is clear sky above those bands, which is bearish for crypto and equities. The indices will have to perform and escape this dip to put the brakes on bonds.\n* VIX Volatility (20.88) - Volatility is coming back to Earth around 20 as the markets need in order to recover. But above 20 is still dangerous, with large price swings possible in either direction. If it starts breaking down through 19 or 18 toward our base at 16, then you can start to feel pretty decent about stocks and crypto once more heading into fall.\n\nI'm starting to take more shortcuts as I hammer these out, so if you're new to these PLEASE ask any questions you'd like and I can elaborate.\n\nComments?

In other words, while I knew I was taking on a huge amount of risk in the event of a bear market or crash, what I didn't realize is how much FLI would slowly decline against ETH during sideways action/chop.\n\nWhen ETH got back to $4k a few weeks ago, FLI was \\~$200, and it had been $400 when I made the trade, so I effectively lost half my stack.  I'd have to look at the chart, but I *think* this was mostly due to the market crashing so abruptly, which triggered an emergency de-levering mechanism and re-pegging.  All that to say, even though there is \"no liquidation risk\" for ETH 2xFLI, you can still very much get \"liquidated\" in the sense that the token can lose significant value against ETH over a matter of a few weeks or months.\n\nOn the plus side, I think my tax burden has basically been reset to $0 for all my long-term holdings... so there's that.\n\n**Uniswap LP Opportunity**\n\nSo if FLI loses against ETH both during bear markets and during sideways chop, realistically it only makes sense to hold ETH 2xFLI over very short time periods (e.g. if on Tuesday night you think we've hit a local bottom at $2700 and you want to trade the bounce), *or* if you get lucky during a couple months of a bull run (say December 2020 to April 2021) where FLI's outperformance of ETH can significantly outpace any short-term chop/volatility drift.\n\nThat being said, I do think there is mid-term value to be extracted from FLI, which is to provide an ETH + 2x FLI LP on Uniswap.  You still have some volatility drift risk here, but if you set laddered LPs in various price ranges, theoretically you can outperform the drift during sideways chop (because you can earn LP fees at 30-50%+ APY), and can even take advantage of short-term drops.\n\nFor example, let's say you have $150k in capital.  The price of ETH is currently $3k.  You deposit $50k in capital into 3 LPs:\n\n* LP 1: Range is between $1750 - $3250 ETH (would require something like 15% FLI and 85% ETH)\n* LP 2: $2250 - $3750 ETH (50/50)\n* LP 3: $2750 - $4250 ETH (25% ETH/75% FLI)\n\nTheoretically, this grouping is set up perfectly for chop between $2800-$3200.  You will also still earn fees in 2 of the 3 LPs if ETH drops down to $2300 (LP 3 would be out of range).  If ETH goes to $3500, you can either leave LP 1 as a hedge against a future crash, or remove your liquidity, which will now be 100% denominated in ETH, and roughly 1.18x the ETH you put in.  In turn, as the price of ETH rises beyond the upper limit of each of your LPs, you can remove the liquidity in 100% ETH, and you've effectively slowly traded the FLI for ETH.\n\nDo note that volatility drift would cause the LPs to slowly shift higher in range over time.  For example if ETH is still chopping sideways after a month, you would expect LP 1's \"effective range\" to require something like $2000-$3500 ETH or even higher.  LP 2 would be $2500-$4000, etc.  But again, you're earning significant fees over that period that will offset the chop, so long as there are no significant (25-50%+) market crashes.\n\n**The Strategy**\n\nWhich brings me to a possible strategy if you think ETH is going to chop sideways and then accelerate up to $10,000+ in the next few months (as I do).\n\n1.\tDeposit ETH + FLI into \\~3 laddered LPs on Uniswap (too many means more gas to claim fees, deposit and remove liquidity, etc.)\n2.\tCollect fees from the trades and deposit these as ETH into Alchemix vault\n3.\tBorrow up to 25% alETH, deposit into Yearn vault (e.g. crvSTETH)\n4.\tWhen ETH climbs out of range of the lowest LP, re-deposit as the new highest LP\n5.\tDo this until ETH = $10,000 and all LPs have converted to 100% ETH\n6.\tDeposit this ETH into Alchemix (or another yield-earning DeFi app of your choosing)\n7.\tBorrow up to 25% alETH, trade for DAI, deposit into Alchemix DAI vault, borrow 50% DAI, cash out into USD (AKA what Logris has talked about)\n8.\tFinally and perhaps most importantly... find a CPA in January 2022 who can sort all of the taxes out so you don't slam your head through a wall\n\nWould be interested to hear any thoughts or pushback so I don't fuck up my stack like I did in May.

So sometime within 1.5 years after the merge we&#39;re going to see all these reserves dry up and no more ETH available for sale without prying it out of the hands of hodlers at supply shock prices.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-23 23:40:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"he29l4w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pto076","parent_id":"t1_he24i56","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/BAM415","body":"I'm happy that this move west doesn't come at the expense of any indigenous populations.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m happy that this move west doesn&#39;t come at the expense of any indigenous populations.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-23 19:48:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"he1n3k7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pto076","parent_id":"t1_he0z5ke","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Busy-Appearance-6077","body":"The average Joe Pioneer and Joe Native did pretty good where no goverments were involved with just the occasional murderous raid followed by murderous counter raid.
