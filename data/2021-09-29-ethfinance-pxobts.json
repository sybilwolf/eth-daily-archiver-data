Thought I would do my part in improving client diversity and therefore switching to Nethermind.Im using the ethereum on arm image, which works pretty well, but Im not sure on how long the initial sync should take and a bit confused on the output of Nethermind. It is doing something, not synced yet (since the Grafana dashboard still says current block 0), but Im not sure how long it should take (has been 5 days now). Using 135 gb of diskspace - growing with about 2 gb a day, that seems a bit slow?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-29 03:47:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"heph9gp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pxobts","parent_id":"t3_pxobts","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProfStrangelove","body":"If you don't get an answer here try r/ethstaker","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If you don&#39;t get an answer here try <a href=\"/r/ethstaker\">r/ethstaker</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-29 04:17:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hepjo1s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pxobts","parent_id":"t1_heph9gp","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sneakpeekbot","body":"Here's a sneak peek of /r/ethstaker using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!\n\n\\#1: [Why you should stop worrying about your validator's uptime and start embracing the chaos instead](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/nnwfx1/why_you_should_stop_worrying_about_your/)  \n\\#2: [Let's be clear: EthStaker welcomes anyone with any interest in staking on Ethereum in any way they choose.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/mm1k1f/lets_be_clear_ethstaker_welcomes_anyone_with_any/)  \n\\#3: [Regarding the recent beacon chain incident](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/mxpz57/regarding_the_recent_beacon_chain_incident/)\n\n----\n^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/o8wk1r/blacklist_ix/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s a sneak peek of <a href=\"/r/ethstaker\">/r/ethstaker</a> using the <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year\">top posts</a> of the year!</p>\n\n<p>#1: <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/nnwfx1/why_you_should_stop_worrying_about_your/\">Why you should stop worrying about your validator&#39;s uptime and start embracing the chaos instead</a><br/>\n#2: <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/mm1k1f/lets_be_clear_ethstaker_welcomes_anyone_with_any/\">Let&#39;s be clear: EthStaker welcomes anyone with any interest in staking on Ethereum in any way they choose.</a><br/>\n#3: <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/mxpz57/regarding_the_recent_beacon_chain_incident/\">Regarding the recent beacon chain incident</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><sup><sup>I&#39;m</sup></sup> <sup><sup>a</sup></sup> <sup><sup>bot,</sup></sup> <sup><sup>beep</sup></sup> <sup><sup>boop</sup></sup> <sup><sup>|</sup></sup> <sup><sup>Downvote</sup></sup> <sup><sup>to</sup></sup> <sup><sup>remove</sup></sup> <sup><sup>|</sup></sup> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot\"><sup><sup>Contact</sup></sup> <sup><sup>me</sup></sup></a> <sup><sup>|</sup></sup> <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/\"><sup><sup>Info</sup></sup></a> <sup><sup>|</sup></sup> <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/o8wk1r/blacklist_ix/\"><sup><sup>Opt-out</sup></sup></a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-29 04:17:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hepjp1u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pxobts","parent_id":"t1_hepjo1s","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"good idea, thanks!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>good idea, thanks!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-29 04:24:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hepk9sq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pxobts","parent_id":"t1_hepjo1s","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Took me the best part of a week to sync Nethermind on a NUC - I can only imagine how long it would take on a raspberry pi.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Took me the best part of a week to sync Nethermind on a NUC - I can only imagine how long it would take on a raspberry pi.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-09-29 04:22:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hepk3qa","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pxobts","parent_id":"t1_heph9gp","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"haha that is good to know.
