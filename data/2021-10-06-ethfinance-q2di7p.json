Make all this money for us?! The nerve...\n\nReally exciting indicators shaping up. Nothing's guaranteed but lots of opportunities.\n\n* When BTC cleared the August inflection point above 48.8k, I mentioned some upwards thrust coming and... yep, it got a little boost. Now it's even above the almighty 61.8 fib line (from ATH to summer low) at 51.2k. That's a big clear if it starts closing larger and larger timeframes above. It's up to the 6H so far.\n* To add, it's also broken out of the RSI downtrend on the daily and is literally *right there* on the weekly, hence this drawn out battle.\n* Keep in mind this is the exact same setup as September 6th. Clear the 61.8 and breakout on the daily RSI... then fail. The difference is seasonality. It's not September and we're so far counter-trading a weakening stock market. As more and more timeframes close, the stress will fade.\n* ETH also closed the daily above the 61.8 at $3500, but has fallen back through a bit. Nice bull flag potential on timeframes as high as the 4H though. It also has MAs racing up to meet it as possible dynamic support around $3450. Plus, ETH has *waaaaaaaay* more headroom on the RSI before it has to also have a breakout. It's the kind of pattern that reaffirms BTC moving first in Q4. Should grandpa hold strong above 51.2k, there's very little keeping ETH from 3750 before RSI forces it to nap.\n* The DXY (94.21) dollar index is back in force, in the process of forming a higher low and continuing on to the death level above 94.50. It breaks and confirms? God help equities, and probably crypto although these past weeks have said differently. It's my personal, uneducated opinion Wall Street will double top it at 94.50. Or maybe it's just hope...\n\nI'm still tracking stock markets but nowhere near as in detail because, rather obviously, we're not correlated right now. It's weakness is a headwind, sure, but so far hasn't been a death knell.\n\n* The SPY (433) looks like garbage. It needed a close above 436 for bulls, but instead got rejected at that prior low and is now consolidating at the lower low, aka a bear flag/pennant/continuation depending on if you squint at it. Similar if not even more damning movement as the bull trap two weeks ago.\n* My targets I spoke of last month are still the zones to watch: 425, 416, 405 are all bottom targets.\n* AAPL (141.11) is a key indicator stock in this drop so far. If it continues down to its 200D EMA at 132, no reason to think the rest of the S&P won't follow suit for some juicy bottom tests. #juicybottomtests\n\nU.S. Non-farm Payrolls on Friday morning!\n\nQCCC?\n\nCheers!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I leave you guys alone for a day and what do you go and do?!

No, of course not, but bears are rapidly running out of time to do so. Capping 53k was a major local higher high. I only say \"local\" because we're still in the summer pattern, if just barely. I want to stay conservative.\n* The daily RSI broke out of the 2021 downtrend, which I marked as starting basically January 2nd. That's huge. But it also means RSIs up to the daily timeframe are white hot. It needs to cool off.\n* It could honestly come all the way back down to test 53k (the top of Ye Olde Fractal) and that'd be crazy bullish. Of course, we'd all prefer if it just cools off over time by staying more or less around this level. Either way, BTC needs to chill before this next leg.\n* Once it gets some RSI breathing room again, it's really just the 78.6 fib line at $57.2k and then gargantuan all-of-2021-bullrun inflection point at 58k. I can't understate how that battle will most likely exhaust us so get ready. But above 58k, the dead cat and bear market narratives are invalidated and the final months of bull season begin.\n* ETH got a little rejection at 3600, to be expect. Remember we ran up hotter than BTC the past two months. $3600 is our version of 58k -- a huge inflection point representing the state of the entire bull run. I think we can get above it after getting some RSI headroom back.\n* Ratio ratio ratio... This happens every year. Newbies complain. Veterans assuage. Like clockwork. We always bleed October - December. But in some potentially good news, we broke down below the 100D against BTC and just broke down through the upward trend line we've followed since May. How's this good? The last three times we broke through were May 22, June 24, and July 27 each leading to absolute rips back upward. The seasonality will probably prevent the same magnitude from occurring (until December gets here) but it could still permit at least a relief rally for the ratio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Meanwhile in Equitiesville... The SPY continued its will they won't they bull trap formation, closing at 434.90 which looks good in a vacuum but is still below the needed 436 level. Even at 436 -- which would only staunch the bleeding, nothing more -- there's still incredible amounts of repair necessary.

A failure and turnaround this week could make for a very, I stress VERY, local lower high, which would be, again, the first early sign of respite for bulls.
