But a basic login prompt isn&#39;t harmful.</p>\n\n<p>This came up because web3j <em>doesn&#39;t</em> prefix the message with its standard Sign class, so the recover functionality wasn&#39;t compatible between a message signed in Metamask and a backend written in web3j and I was wondering wtf was going on.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-10 09:23:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hg4a37a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q51hvk","parent_id":"t3_q51hvk","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Papazio","body":"Interesting stuff!
