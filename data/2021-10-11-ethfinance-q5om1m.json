But something happened the last couple of days and the game is about to change I guess. And that is good, cause the status quo is not good in a lot of ways, but the solution won't be easy.\u00a0\n\nSo let's start with the game changer to understand where I'm coming from. Last week someone found out that Divergence, a VC invested in Ribbon, had farmed the RBN airdrop with several wallets. The sum of all airdrops farmed by the VC was close to 2.5M USD. This money was later returned, but of course the harm was done already.\n\nObviously\u00a0this isn't only a VC problem (though VC are probably in the best position to game the system because they have detailed info on the airdrop in some cases), but a general problem. It's no secret that there are people trying to game airdrops by using multiple wallets to farm airdrops. I have, with a very limited amount of wallets, but I have. These sybil attacks are a problem for the ecosystem and shouldn't be tolerated. You might think it's also not in the best interest of protocols, but interestingly they still use the same mechanics and that might have a reason. [Hasu thinks it might be the case that the airdrops are also used to allow employees, friends and even VCs to make some additional money and become rich together](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1446983492370317314).\u00a0\n\nHow can protocols still reward \"real\" / legit early users and at the same time not reward farming wallets?\u00a0\n\nSo let's dive in by understanding the goals of an airdrop, the implications and what could/ should be changed to make airdrops better.\u00a0\n\n* Governance: If the goal is governance, then the airdrop should be\u00a0\n   * spread to users that are likely to really participate in governance = early/ regular users of your protocol or users of a similar protocol that participate in governance of that competitor\n   * spread to as many users as possible to make sure governance really is decentralized\u00a0\n   * distributed in a way that the power is not in the hand of a few whales\u00a0\n* Marketing: I think we can assume that today protocols are also using airdrop rumors to attract usage and liquidity. If that is the case, the airdrop (rumors) should\n   * attract early users\n   * add early liquidity\u00a0\n   * attract new users and new liquidity once the airdrop is distributed and everyone is talking about it\n   * reward loyal users and liquidity providers and let them participate in the success\n\nOf course users also have \"goals\", or expectations. I think especially when there are protocols without tokens and rumors, users expect an airdrop. And of course past similar airdrops influence the expectations user have for future airdrops. This is connected to the last marketing bullet. But I am explicitly not saying that protocols should reward users for their loyalty and meet their expectations.\u00a0\n\nAirdrops usually\u00a0happen as retroactive airdrops. The first major airdrop was UNI more or less one year ago. There were others before that, but imo the success was the driver for many airdrops that followed in the last 12 months. The UNI airdrop was a beauty because of its design and timing. One interaction (even failed tx were able to claim the airdrop) was enough. Obviously some \"OGs\" got more than one by using multiple addresses, but that was a coincidence and not intentional since you couldn't really prepare for the requirements.\u00a0\n\nOver time the\u00a0ability to prepare has changed quite a lot. One famous example is a [German user that set up 500 addresses\u00a0to game the 1inch airdrop](https://twitter.com/timoharings/status/1342623028530843650). In case of success his tx would have gotten him a profit of 1.XM, but he didn't meet the requirements of volume per trade (made 17.5$ / tx, req was 20$ / tx). Still I am sure this tweet inspired a lot of people to try to \"make it\" but farming airdrops, he at least motivated me to play the game.\u00a0\n\nSo how can the broken mechanics of airdrops be changed to still allow airdrops while also being resistant to sybil attacks? There is one [interesting twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Evan_ss6/status/1446523191011069952) on this I would like to pick up.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n* Introducing a \"MVA\" - a minimum viable airdrop --> one tx should only be rewarded by a minimum viable amount of $token. \n* Introduce \"multi-step\" requirements so that there is effort involved to qualify\n* Reward based on time and stake by handing out higher rewards for users that did higher transactions and provided liquidity for a longer period of time\n\nI think these are very good proposals to design better airdrops for the future.\u00a0Some things I would like to add. These are my ideas and it's likely there are some downsides I haven't\u00a0thought about. \n\n* Introduce a minimum threshold for the transaction (similar to the one in the 1inch example). This could be an absolute amount (e.g. 10$/50$) or something connected to the tx fee (you won't make a 10$ trade and pay 20$ of fees --> volume/fee > 1 could be an idea).\u00a0\n* Introduce a (anti) sybil score for every address / anti sybil technology\u00a0. Gitcoin already does this for their GR. The better the score, the higher the funding. There are several ways to improve your score. ([And there was a grant to fund the technology for it](https://gitcoin.co/grants/explorer/?page=2&limit=6&me=false&sort_option=weighted_shuffle&network=mainnet&state=active&profile=false&sub_round_slug=false&collections_page=1&grant_regions=&grant_types=&grant_tags=&tenants=&idle=true&collection_id=1&tab=grants))\n* Try to identify addresses that were only set-up to farm the airdrop\n   * Analyze interacting addresses based on the time difference between funding and interaction with the protocol. The lower the difference the higher the chance it's just farming.\u00a0\n   * Analyze interacting addresses based on the amount of tx with other protocols. If the address exclusively interacts with the protocol, the higher the chance it's just farming.\u00a0\n   * I would assume that the volume per tx follows a bell curve. Now if there is someone farming with several addresses and always the same amount / approach this would likely lead to unexpected peaks in the curve. Analyze these outbreaks and maybe connect that info with 1 & 2.\u00a0\n\nEspecially the last point is interesting, but maybe also controversial? I think it shouldn't be. I remember J[ulien Bouteloup (Dev Curve, founder SDT and Blackpool) basically announcing on Twitter that he manually blacklisted all SDT dumpers for future airdrops](https://twitter.com/bneiluj/status/1376487799453593601). My first thought was, that he shouldn't be doing this. But the more I thought about it, the more I understood his idea. There is no right to claim an airdrop. Even if you've met the reqs there isn't. I truly think that protocols should be vetting their airdrop recipients to a certain degree and should try to manually exclude those addresses that are likely not the intended audience. In case of doubt it should be up to them to make the call since there are two errors possible and two reactions connected to these erros. Exclude someone that should have received the airdrop cause it's a legit address and the potentially following negative feedback on social media. And: Include a farmer that shouldn't receive the airdrop that might be identified later and leads to similar damage like in the RBN case. In the RBN case the VC was hit the hardest, but obviously there is a chance that people assume that the protocol implicitly accepted that family and friends or even VC farmed and then their reputation could be damaged as well.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback, thoughts, additions and what not.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think airdrops are a very interesting topic and as you probably know I&#39;ve been spending some time to research airdrops, sometimes\u00a0also sharing &quot;alpha&quot; regarding potential airdrops. But something happened the last couple of days and the game is about to change I guess. And that is good, cause the status quo is not good in a lot of ways, but the solution won&#39;t be easy.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So let&#39;s start with the game changer to understand where I&#39;m coming from. Last week someone found out that Divergence, a VC invested in Ribbon, had farmed the RBN airdrop with several wallets. The sum of all airdrops farmed by the VC was close to 2.5M USD. This money was later returned, but of course the harm was done already.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously\u00a0this isn&#39;t only a VC problem (though VC are probably in the best position to game the system because they have detailed info on the airdrop in some cases), but a general problem. It&#39;s no secret that there are people trying to game airdrops by using multiple wallets to farm airdrops. I have, with a very limited amount of wallets, but I have. These sybil attacks are a problem for the ecosystem and shouldn&#39;t be tolerated. You might think it&#39;s also not in the best interest of protocols, but interestingly they still use the same mechanics and that might have a reason. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1446983492370317314\">Hasu thinks it might be the case that the airdrops are also used to allow employees, friends and even VCs to make some additional money and become rich together</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>How can protocols still reward &quot;real&quot; / legit early users and at the same time not reward farming wallets?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So let&#39;s dive in by understanding the goals of an airdrop, the implications and what could/ should be changed to make airdrops better.\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Governance: If the goal is governance, then the airdrop should be\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n<li>spread to users that are likely to really participate in governance = early/ regular users of your protocol or users of a similar protocol that participate in governance of that competitor</li>\n<li>spread to as many users as possible to make sure governance really is decentralized\u00a0</li>\n<li>distributed in a way that the power is not in the hand of a few whales\u00a0</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Marketing: I think we can assume that today protocols are also using airdrop rumors to attract usage and liquidity. If that is the case, the airdrop (rumors) should\n\n<ul>\n<li>attract early users</li>\n<li>add early liquidity\u00a0</li>\n<li>attract new users and new liquidity once the airdrop is distributed and everyone is talking about it</li>\n<li>reward loyal users and liquidity providers and let them participate in the success</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course users also have &quot;goals&quot;, or expectations. I think especially when there are protocols without tokens and rumors, users expect an airdrop. And of course past similar airdrops influence the expectations user have for future airdrops. This is connected to the last marketing bullet. But I am explicitly not saying that protocols should reward users for their loyalty and meet their expectations.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Airdrops usually\u00a0happen as retroactive airdrops. The first major airdrop was UNI more or less one year ago. There were others before that, but imo the success was the driver for many airdrops that followed in the last 12 months. The UNI airdrop was a beauty because of its design and timing. One interaction (even failed tx were able to claim the airdrop) was enough. Obviously some &quot;OGs&quot; got more than one by using multiple addresses, but that was a coincidence and not intentional since you couldn&#39;t really prepare for the requirements.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Over time the\u00a0ability to prepare has changed quite a lot. One famous example is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timoharings/status/1342623028530843650\">German user that set up 500 addresses\u00a0to game the 1inch airdrop</a>. In case of success his tx would have gotten him a profit of 1.XM, but he didn&#39;t meet the requirements of volume per trade (made 17.5$ / tx, req was 20$ / tx). Still I am sure this tweet inspired a lot of people to try to &quot;make it&quot; but farming airdrops, he at least motivated me to play the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So how can the broken mechanics of airdrops be changed to still allow airdrops while also being resistant to sybil attacks?

ETH is probably the crypto least bought for this reason, though the majority of purchases are still for pure speculative purposes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Level 2 (profit from the network)</strong> - People buy a crypto asset hoping to use it to profit from blockchains in some other way. I&#39;d put the current state of DeFi, staking, and most stablecoin purchases in this category. Ethereum currently blows the doors off the competition in this use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Level 3 (non profit driven uses)</strong> - People buy a crypto asset for the utility it provides without expecting to profit from it. This is where we need to get usage if we want crypto to stay relevant and change in the world in the coming decades. The original BTC usage for buying darkweb drugs falls into this category, as well as international remittances. I guess some NFTs fit here, though I think mostly NFTs are still purchased for profit.</p>\n\n<p>There are so many potential use cases from what I&#39;m calling level 3 - from supply chain management, decentralized IDs, audit, parametric insurance, and so on.  When would you think we&#39;ll start seeing some real usage on this front?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-11 08:51:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hg8of7q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q5om1m","parent_id":"t3_q5om1m","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/fiftyfirstsnails","body":"IMO you see low adoption versions of this stuff over the next 1-3 years, but the waves of companies/users actually adopting blockchain en masse for non-marketplace applications is like 5-10 years down the road.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>IMO you see low adoption versions of this stuff over the next 1-3 years, but the waves of companies/users actually adopting blockchain en masse for non-marketplace applications is like 5-10 years down the road.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-11 09:08:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hg8qyon","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q5om1m","parent_id":"t1_hg8of7q","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stablecoin","body":"Try today.
