One token, one consensus. Any contentious changes that causes the blockchain to split, results in users having free coins on the other chain (because of their access to the private keys on the other chain). We have seen this numerous times: Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, BitcoinZ, etc. \n\nThere are no negative consequences for forking Bitcoin...to be more specific - there are no unintended consequences for forking Simple Blockchains.\n\nWe have also seen this in Ethereum with Ethereum Classic. For those unfamiliar with the DAO hack, [here's a nice summary from Gemini] (https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-what-is-a-dao). After the DAO hack in 2016, the 'Code is Law' group spawned Ethereum Classic from the resulting chain split. Ethereum was ~1 year old and the ***community*** decision to hard fork and return the stolen ETH was a tough but necessary choice. Imagine trying to implement PoS today when a single address held 3.6 million ETH.\n\n***Ethereum Today***\n\nThe building blocks of DeFi are stablecoins. [Currently Tether and USDC make up ~60% of all stablecoins on Ethereum.](https://defipulse.com/usd) For better or worse, these two stablecoins are custodial and centralized. They are an IOU token that, in theory, should allow users to redeem them for $1 USD. From these stable coins, we get the numerous other applications that we find in DeFi. Money Legos. Everything built on top of each other. This composability aspect of DeFi is great for creating novel applications. However, if one piece breaks, the rest of the ecosystem will suffer the consequences.\n\n\nMakerDao's Dai was thought to be a fully decentralized stablecoin initially backed only by Ethereum. But the need for Dai's growth and liquidity, resulted in MakerDao's governance incorporating USDC into it's balance sheets. [USDC now represents over ~50% of all Dai generated.](https://daistats.com/#/)\n\n\nLet's focus on USDC because I believe it's the main reason why a minority chain can never exist (EDIT: in the sense of the community being uncertain about the outcome of a chain split).\n\nUSDC represents ~$30.22 Billion that is being circulated on Ethereum. If a minority group were to ever split the Ethereum Network, there would now be two copies of all tokens and all stablecoins. And because USDC is an IOU token, there can only be one official record of that token to be redeemed. [CENTRE, the group behind USDC,](https://www.centre.io/usdc) will have to choose a chain to support and blacklist the addresses on the other chain. \n\n\nWhatever chain CENTRE chooses, the other chain will fall apart. \n\n* USDC becomes worthless \n\n* Dai becomes worthless \n\n* The entire Curve market place falls apart due to USDC and DAI losing their peg\n\n* USDC/DAI debt is now effectively paid off for free \n\n* Liquidity Pools that are paired with USDC are drained as users quickly try to get rid of USDC \n\n* Lenders of USDC/DAI cannot get their USDC back in time and are left holding bags of worthless USDC/DAI tokens. \n\nI could go on and on. The outcome would be horrible as the entire DeFi space on the other chain is crippled.\n\n\n\n**Author's note**: *It was at this point I came across this article while writing this -_- it seems someone smarter than me has had this thought before. I'll continue with my thought process and add it as supplemental reading material. Glad I was on the right track though.\nhttps://medium.com/dragonfly-research/ethereum-is-now-unforkable-thanks-to-defi-9818b967738f*\n\nIn it's current state it would take Miners, Node Operators, Exchanges, and Custodial Stablecoin Operators to choose the chain to support. \n\nAnd a quote from the article I just found that summarizes it better than I could have:\n\n>What this little thought experiment tells us is: Ethereum is not what it used to be. In 2016, Ethereum was still a proof of concept, and ETC could plausibly claim to be a better vision of how the \u201cworld computer\u201d should evolve. But today, it\u2019s clear that ETH is valuable because of the systems that exist on top of it. Unlike Bitcoin, whose ledger is simple enough that forks are functionally airdrops, ETH\u2019s ecosystem is incredibly complex. Because its applications are intertwined with unforkable components, the entire system is rendered unforkable. Any minority fork is doomed to obscurity.\n\nBut this does spawn the next question:\n\nDoes USDC (CENTRE) and other custodial stablecoin operators having this much power over the Network hurt Ethereum? We definitely need more decentralized stablecoins to assist in decreasing our dependence on USDC and USDT. RAI is the only one stablecoin that doesn't touch USDC and USDT at all.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/q6elem/daily_general_discussion_october_12_2021/hgddxwf/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/q6elem/daily_general_discussion_october_12_2021/hgddxwf/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/MoMoNosquito\">u/MoMoNosquito</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&#39;s also the gamble that a POW version of ETH will live on after the Merge, thereby leaving another ETC free money dumping situation.

Instead, we are creating a new stablecoin for this pow chain, called PAI, which is pow Eth collateralised (basically like LUSD).&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Whichever bad actor funding the pow chain after merge can even provide liquidity to a PAI-powETH pool on UniSwap, curve etc to bootstrap it&#39;s use. And once you have an initial powETH collateralised stablecoin, folks can now sell their Eth and erc20 assets into this. It would be a tumultuous first few weeks, and many erc20s and powETH would collapse in price, forked lending protocols become undercollateralised, LP pools going nuts as arb bots leave etc etc but it&#39;s likely whatever tokens survives from this early period will then cockroach its way through.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-12 11:49:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hgdy0ka","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q6elem","parent_id":"t1_hgdrn29","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/SmellyMammoths","body":"Coinbase NFT - launching this year.\n\nhttps://www.coinbase.com/NFT/announce\n\nhttps://help.coinbase.com/en/nft/launch","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Coinbase NFT - launching this year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/NFT/announce\">https://www.coinbase.com/NFT/announce</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://help.coinbase.com/en/nft/launch\">https://help.coinbase.com/en/nft/launch</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-12 11:33:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hgdvoi2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q6elem","parent_id":"t3_q6elem","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/HarryZKE","body":"Stoked to see this bc ftx pushes Solana so there\u2019s other alternatives for mainstream users to use","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Stoked to see this bc ftx pushes Solana so there\u2019s other alternatives for mainstream users to use</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-12 11:43:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hgdx3fm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q6elem","parent_id":"t1_hgdvoi2","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Do we know if this is built on Ethereum (L2 or otherwise)?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Do we know if this is built on Ethereum (L2 or otherwise)?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-12 11:42:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hgdx1jr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q6elem","parent_id":"t1_hgdvoi2","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ev1501","body":"Its not on L2 which seems dumb.
