The bounce and recovery seemingly happened for no reason and the etf news hit coincidentally when btc nearing at all time highs. Maybe I&#39;m wrong but I don&#39;t believe in coincidences in this space. Smells like frontrunning to me, especially in the absence of strength over the weekend. But maybe I&#39;m wrong.

But if crypto adheres to anything, it's Fibonacci levels. Typically used for retracement, it can be used (far less accurately) for looking ahead.\n\nCase in point, draw a fib from BTC's April ATH at $64.8k  to the summer low at $29.3k and you'll see every major fib level was some kind of inflection point on the way back up to 62k. It also offers extensions beyond ATH and bots do tend to take those into account. The 127.2 fib line is at $74.5k and the full 161.8 is at $86.8k. There are also higher lines that get even less accurate. I believe the highest I saw on someone else's chart was $106k for the maximum fib line at present, suggesting we'd need some consolidation to go further or that's the top.\n\nTo prove it's not all garbage, take the fib from 2018 top at $20k down to COVID low at $3200 and you'll see the \"inaccurate\" 161.8 fib extension... was none other than $30k, which was BTC's honestly only real resistance during the 2020 bonanza and of course the support in the summer bear.
