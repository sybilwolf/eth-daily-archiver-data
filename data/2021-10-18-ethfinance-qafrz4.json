This is for you /u/jtnichol. I couldn't whip this up in time for the daily yesterday.\n\nLet's start with this: why do platforms nowadays choose to incentivize Liquidity Providers? It wasn't always done this way; most of the older tokens such as MKR, LINK, and COMP have never done this. So why did this catch on? Why do SPELL, ALCX, XTK, and so many others follow this pattern? The basic answer is the rewards draw liquidity locusts and those locusts serve some purpose. When a project is bootstrapping an initial burst of emissions is marketing and a distribution mechanism of a governance token. This worked well enough for YFI. After an initial burst though what purpose do the liquidity locusts serve? For each of the platforms above there is *something else* they need liquidity for.\n\nTake Alchemix for example. Without the Curve pools for their alAssets the peg would purely rely on the Transmuter so they have been spending ALCX to incentivize people to hold alAssets in Curve pools so people who mint their alAsset can immediately use their newfound loan rather than waiting on the Transmuter. But why also incentivize an ALCX/ETH pool? Well, if there weren't rewards for the ALCX/ETH pool the issuance to the alAsset Curve pools would crash the ALCX price which would hurt the DAO's ability to incentivize the Curve pools in the long term. So they have to issue even more ALCX in order to be able to do *something else*. If the first need didn't exist then they could do without the issuance. In the end, hodlers are paying a heavy inflation tax for the privilege of the liquidity in the alAsset Curve pools.\n\nThis is a common pattern. XToken needs to provide exit liquidity for their xAssets, especially in cases where there are unstaking delays on the underlying assets so they incentivize their xAssetCLR pools with XTK. This then necessitates also funding an XTK/ETH pool and XTK staking pool to give people a reason to buy and hold XTK as well. It's a bit of an uncomfortable Ouroboros situation where emissions of a token are used to incentivize buying and holding the token.\n\nA further uncomfortable truth is emissions only draw liquidity as long as they last. You have to *keep emitting* to retain the liquidity. The locusts are extraordinarily mercenary. I call traditional liquidity mining *renting* liquidity. This is effective in the short term and expensive in the long term. Usually, when structured as I outlined above the base emissions gradually overwhelm the demand for the governance token and drive down the price of the governance token on a long enough time frame. You have to eventually answer how the protocol is going to pay for the emissions and run a balanced budget. To show price growth under heavy emissions the protocol has to also be *aggressively* growing at the same time (e.g. SPELL).\n\nI measure the effectiveness of this rented liquidity by how many $'s of liquidity you draw for $1 of emissions. The effectiveness certainly varies by asset class. Renting stablecoins like for the alUSD generally requires 10-20% APR. That means it takes $1 of emissions to rent $5-$10 of liquidity for a stablecoin pool for a year. Renting ETH has a ratio of about 20:1 in its pure form. Renting liquidity for your Pool-2 is usually the most expensive type of liquidity. In the case of XTK they aren't even getting 1:1 right now. ALCX is doing little better at about 1:25:1.\n\nRenting liquidity for Pool-2's is so costly Alchemix has turned to buying their own liquidity using Olympus Pro which makes sense to me at these rates. If you haven't read this [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1447398430574141445) by Scoopy, go do so. So what's happening there? Olympus DAO [writes](https://olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-olympus-pro-d8db3052fca5)\n\n>Liquidity mining, unsurprisingly, faces the same drawback as PoW mining: it is a perpetual expense with no lasting benefit. Liquidity mining can be equated to renting \u2014 it may be cheaper than buying at first, but stop paying rent and you no longer have it. As DeFi matures, it is becoming increasingly clear that incentives are not a viable long-term strategy for networks. The goal should always be to bootstrap and accrue long-term defensible value, rather than perpetually pay high interest on mercenary capital.\n\nBasically they are saying Proof of Work is to Proof of Stake as Liquidity Mining is to Bonds. I agree with that much. Where I disagree with them is that it's more economical to buy LP's via bonds than to buy LP's directly. At a basic level, you shove $1 into the bond contract and you get $1+X dollars worth of governance tokens after some delay. What is the advantage to the protocol of buying $1 of LP for $1+X instead of just buying $1 of LP? They *are* buying the LPs; they are just adding some conditions on the sale via this bond program. But why pay Olympus DAO a 3.3% fee for the privilege of buying an LP? Clearly this isn't more *capital efficient* than just buying the LP.\n\nWhat the bonds actually do is add a useful delay. Imagine you are a DAO treasury with a bunch of tokens. Your pool-2 is highly illiquid because you don't want to do liquidity mining. So, you set the bond to like a 1 year time and offer a steep discount of something like 75%. For reference, a 50% discount would be equivalent to the 100% APR XTK is having to offer LP's for their XTK/ETH pool right now. The difference is that when the bond matures the protocol owns the liquidity as opposed to having rented it. At a minimum, the treasury didn't market sell their governance token into a highly illiquid pool when they sold the bond unlike if they had to buy the LP using their governance tokens. In the short term it actually goes the other way; people with ETH had to buy the governance token to mint the LP to buy the bond. In other words it bootstraps more efficiently. Further, the bonds can be streamed out at a variable market rate unlike standard emissions. As a result, the token can maintain its value in the short term while the protocol becomes established and by the time the bill is due there is hopefully a deeper liquidity pool to absorb the bond maturing and hopefully there is revenue to create base demand on the token somehow. This is a win for the DAO if investors are willing to pay for the bonds and risk their capital being locked for the delay.\n\nThere is a middle ground here between renting and owning that I find fascinating as well. It has to do with liquidity direction rights which is a special subclass of governance decision. As a simplistic example, imagine I was giving away $10k. It's a foregone conclusion that it's going somewhere. However, you can pay me money to decide where it goes within some limits. How much is the power to influence that decision worth? If one of the places I am willing to donate it to is also a place you were independently going to donate to then securing my donation is worth *up to* $10k. Any amount you bribe me for less than that is basically a leveraged donation by you. If you can secure $10k to your cause by bribing me $1 then bribing me is absolutely the way to go rather than donating right?\n\nThis might sound insane but this is literally what is going on with Curve. Their DAO has decided on an emission schedule for CRV for LP's who stake in a gauge. What they didn't do however is lock in the rates per pool. Instead the DAO gets to vote which pools get what share of the emissions. Then the DAO explicitly enabled bribes for voters who choose a pool. Predictably, someone (Convex) then built a system on top of that to optimally distribute their votes to maximize bribe revenue. And voila, my insane thought exercise has come to life. So, if you are renting liquidity *anyway* and you are paying out to Curve LP's then how much CRV can you get for $1 of your governance token? What is the multiplier of using your emissions for Curve bribes compared to direct emissions to LPs?\n\nFrom the [Alchemix Discord](https://discord.com/channels/738480789464940634/826152864837140492/898911248593330186) (they recently started Curve bribes).\n\n>for the record, we went from 95m TVL on Saddle to now 48m on Saddle and 265m on Curve, so 300m TVL total\n\nThat was for a 400 ALCX bribe. Bribes are every 2 weeks. So let's call that 200M in rented liquidity for a cost of about $150k every 2 weeks ($4M a year). That's about $50 in rented liquidity on bribing vs direct liquidity mining. This was for an ETH pool. Compare $50 here to $20 for direct emissions. It's an incredible force multiplier which just means that bribes are currently underpriced by the market.[Here's](https://twitter.com/VotiumProtocol/status/1447550501109829633) another example. 9k invested for 22M liquidity. That's closer to 100:1. Just incredible.\n\nSo renting liquidity direction rights are a powerful force multiplier over renting liquidity directly. Does a similar force multiplier exist for buying liquidity direction rights compared to buying liquidity? Find out soon! More to come.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Preview of something I&#39;m writing. This is for you <a href=\"/u/jtnichol\">/u/jtnichol</a>.

If this is you, congrats! But to anyone who is speculating in these spaces or considering it, I\u2019d like to share with you my experiences doing similar things to help you all stay rational and grounded. I find it hard to admit, but I have lost a sizeable amount of my stack to shitcoins and speculating. If you want to skip to the lessons and don\u2019t want to read my life story then skip below the bottom line in this post.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nMy story starts in the later stages of the 2017 bull market. I stumbled upon this interesting new project called Chainlink.\n\n>Anti-hype devs (very refreshing in the peak of ICO mania), a unique but necessary usecase and no real competition. \n\n*Holy shit. I\u2019m going to be rich!*\n\nI decided to put my next couple of months worth of DCAing into stinky linkies.\n\nFast forward to mid 2019 and LINK is up about 10-20x on the ETH ratio. I sold my LINK for ETH having turned 10% of my stack in LINK into about 150% of my ETH stack. Just like that I had a 2.5x larger stack. At this stage it\u2019s easy to get cocky and think you\u2019re s shitcoin investing genius. However, fortunately, I was able to resist these dangerous emotional thoughts\u2026 that was until the DeFi summer of 2020. People were making millions all around me and I was feeling like a sucker missing out on all of these sick gains. So I decide to jump into some shitcoins with seemingly good fundamentals and waited for them to do a Chainlink. But they never did. One coin went down 80%, another down 50% and worst of all, my biggest bag basically went to $0 and I lost 98% of my investment in ETH terms. All over the course of 6 months. Now fortunately thanks to many of the wise words I had picked up from folks in this sub over the years as well as some good investing advice from my Dad, I only invested what I could afford to lose in ETH terms. Overall, I lost about 25% of my ETH stack to my shitcoin shenanigans.\n\nHowever, it turned out that this wasn\u2019t the end of the pain. At this point I moved to a new investing strategy, keeping things simple and risk-off. BTC, ETH and DeFi Pulse Index (DPI). 80% ETH, 10% BTC just as a hedge, and the remaining 10% in DPI. I truly thought at this point I was buying the dip with DPI. The price was half of what it was many months ago in ETH terms, so surely I was buying the dip! Another few months later it is evident that I did not buy the dip and what was 10% of my stack in DPI is now 5%. That might not sound like a lot, but as someone who isn\u2019t earning much at work and can only DCA tiny fractions of his whole stack, seeing the ETH value of my portfolio continue to bleed is very painful.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nSo what is the point of this post? Well there are a few important lessons here. The main ones being:\n\n1. Not to fall into the trap of thinking you\u2019re an investing genius after one lucky break. Realise that investing in small new projects really is more luck than skill for 95% of people. Only a select few with years of experience and with a truly deep technical and understanding of the crypto space and markets as a whole can repeatedly pick out winners.\n2. Because of point #1, don\u2019t allocate a large proportion of your stack to speculative investments like NFTs you want to flip for more money and whatever the hot new \u201cDeFi 2.0\u201d project is. Use my story as a warning here. Had I let myself invest more than 30% of my stack into altcoins (and yes I did consider it when I was most blinded by greed) I would have lost huge amounts of money which would have completely changed my bigger picture goals and exit strategy (and 30% is still a large percentage of your stack to invest in small cap coins! Remember that I only had 10% in Chainlink and made well over a 100% return on my whole stack. You don\u2019t need a lot in speculative plays).\n\nIn the process of writing out this story I\u2019ve realised that there are a few other important lessons to take home here such as:\n\n- Just because something is \u201cblue chip\u201d or a large index doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be extremely volatile. DPI is down more than two thirds from its high point in ETH terms. So if you put all of your ETH into DPI thinking that it would grow faster than ETH since it was a basket of blue chip DeFi alts which have more upside than ETH, then you\u2019d have lost as much as two thirds of your ETH! And this is with a very logical sounding investment strategy.\n- ETH is going to be an extremely tough asset to outperform. Many altcoins have inflationary issuance schedules. Especially those which feature yield farms. ETH on the other hand is soon to go deflationary and based on recent EIP-1559 burn rates, massively deflationary. So while you may still be able to make money in alts, what is the point if holding the much safer asset ETH will earn you more money (hence I always measure alt performance in ETH terms as you may have noticed above).\n\nSo I wish you all lots of luck out there with whatever speculative investments you decide to ape into, just please keep the above things in mind. This is the opportunity of a lifetime but it is far too easy to lose your ticket to financial freedom to one single bad decision and there likely won\u2019t be an opportunity of this scale again in our lifetimes.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I know a lot of people are making tons of money with NFTs, shitcoins and speculating in new projects like \u201cDeFi 2.0\u201d coins.

You can call it hopium as well, I don't care. I've thought a lot about this and been time traveling (as a millionaire) and would like to tell you how it will all play out. \n\nSome people early on said that this cycle will be similar to 2013 and that there will be a double bubble. While this would be cool, I think history will rhyme, but not repeat. So let me introduce you to the tripple bubble. Yes gentlemen, you'll be experiencing 2 more bubbles within the next 9 months. And yes, no super cycle. So how will this play out?\n\nBubble one is obviously the May bubble of the past. The second bubble is starting now. BTC is slowly going to knock on 100ks door and by slowly I mean within the next 6 to 8 weeks or so. There will be some ups and downs on the way, probably a rejection at 100k first, but nothing too heavy. The rest of the market will follow closely, but ETH wont outperm BTC during that period and ratio will continue to bleed. Just for xmas and new year there will be fireworks. The first days of Jan will be calm and then BTC will go from 150k to 250k in about one week. S2F is memed into reality, maxis will take victory lap over victory lap. ETH will be at like 15-20k at that time. Here's the sad part: no alt season, alts increased with BTC, but there is delayed blow off top for alts this time. Why? Because we will see a similar crash like the one in May. Just too many leveraged positions caused by peak euphoria, profit taking at 250k will lead to a liquidation cascade that cant really be stopped and before you know it we are back at 100 BTC and sub 10k ETH. We could go as low as 5k. This sub will be a mess. People will tell you its over. \n\nBut its not. The market will slowly bleed, but there still is this one event coming up. The merge. Just before the date for the merge, lets assume May, the market will pick up again, this time led by ETH. ETH will break 10k at the end of April, because smart money buys ETH,  they know what's going to happen. ETH and Ray will do a hell of a show. Until the merge. And even though the merge goes well, its a sell the news event, ETH loses 20% in a day, maxis still drunk will go crazy. Udi will tweet something about \"the most obvious dead cat bounce ever\". And that tweet will revert the market. The supply shock will kick in, all sellers have sold, and ETH will go crazy. ETH will break 20k. ETH will break 30k. ETH will flip BTC. Best case scenario is ETH will go close to 50k. All this will happen within 6-8 weeks after the merge. This sub will be a mess. And at one point peak euphoria will start the real bear. Because this is not sustainable. Even with the supply shock, at one point things will correct, big players will make sure. The tripple bubble is in and we can finally build again. Bear market. Only for 12 months, but still a bear market. And a happy end. \n\nNow some real talk: \n\nWhy a tripple bubble? The tl;dr is: I can't imagine that we will have 9 more months of full bull. But I also can't imagine that the merge is a non-event. So we need a BTC blow off top at the beginning of 2022, crash, sideways action with some fake outs, and then the ETH blow off top shortly after the merge.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Gentlemen, are you guys ready for some fiction?

While this would be cool, I think history will rhyme, but not repeat. So let me introduce you to the tripple bubble. Yes gentlemen, you&#39;ll be experiencing 2 more bubbles within the next 9 months. And yes, no super cycle. So how will this play out?</p>\n\n<p>Bubble one is obviously the May bubble of the past. The second bubble is starting now. BTC is slowly going to knock on 100ks door and by slowly I mean within the next 6 to 8 weeks or so. There will be some ups and downs on the way, probably a rejection at 100k first, but nothing too heavy. The rest of the market will follow closely, but ETH wont outperm BTC during that period and ratio will continue to bleed. Just for xmas and new year there will be fireworks. The first days of Jan will be calm and then BTC will go from 150k to 250k in about one week. S2F is memed into reality, maxis will take victory lap over victory lap. ETH will be at like 15-20k at that time. Here&#39;s the sad part: no alt season, alts increased with BTC, but there is delayed blow off top for alts this time. Why? Because we will see a similar crash like the one in May. Just too many leveraged positions caused by peak euphoria, profit taking at 250k will lead to a liquidation cascade that cant really be stopped and before you know it we are back at 100 BTC and sub 10k ETH. We could go as low as 5k. This sub will be a mess. People will tell you its over. </p>\n\n<p>But its not. The market will slowly bleed, but there still is this one event coming up. The merge. Just before the date for the merge, lets assume May, the market will pick up again, this time led by ETH. ETH will break 10k at the end of April, because smart money buys ETH,  they know what&#39;s going to happen. ETH and Ray will do a hell of a show. Until the merge. And even though the merge goes well, its a sell the news event, ETH loses 20% in a day, maxis still drunk will go crazy. Udi will tweet something about &quot;the most obvious dead cat bounce ever&quot;. And that tweet will revert the market. The supply shock will kick in, all sellers have sold, and ETH will go crazy. ETH will break 20k. ETH will break 30k. ETH will flip BTC. Best case scenario is ETH will go close to 50k. All this will happen within 6-8 weeks after the merge. This sub will be a mess. And at one point peak euphoria will start the real bear. Because this is not sustainable. Even with the supply shock, at one point things will correct, big players will make sure. The tripple bubble is in and we can finally build again. Bear market. Only for 12 months, but still a bear market. And a happy end. </p>\n\n<p>Now some real talk: </p>\n\n<p>Why a tripple bubble? The tl;dr is: I can&#39;t imagine that we will have 9 more months of full bull. But I also can&#39;t imagine that the merge is a non-event. So we need a BTC blow off top at the beginning of 2022, crash, sideways action with some fake outs, and then the ETH blow off top shortly after the merge.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-18 00:18:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hh302ps","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qafrz4","parent_id":"t3_qafrz4","score":47,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KuDeTa","body":"Put that needle down.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Put that needle down.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-18 00:43:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hh31rq4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qafrz4","parent_id":"t1_hh302ps","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Lol amazing.

In a general sense what would be the difference from Olympus to something like Bitcoin? Both are supposed to be stable stores of value but have a ton of volatility and both require people to long term hold to maintain that value. Both are aiming to be a currency as well. I guess you would argue that Bitcoin is sustained by name recognition but honestly the argument doesn\u2019t hold up for me. \n\nLike it or not there are a ton of cryptos that require believers and people to hodl to even be usable. \n\nAll that aside, because that truly isn\u2019t a convincing argument (for bitcoin or olympus honestly), for me personally, I am extremely bullish on the idea of protocol owned liquidity. Alchemix was able to decrease their issuance tremendously by adopting this. If there was another project that was creating partnerships and assisting in protocol owned liquidity then I would be investing in that but there is not.
