It's certainly a hot topic right now! There was even a hot [Bankless episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKlZ58Hawjs&ab_channel=Bankless) on this just today. This is going to be insane babbling if you aren't familiar with the concepts of liquidity renting, liquidity direction rights, and bonds so read my other post if you're already confused.\n\nFollowing up on that let's talk about liquidity from the perspective of a DAO. DAO's need liquidity depth for their products. Any protocol that creates a synthetic token usually needs a liquidity pool with some depth for that token to be remotely useful. Stablecoin protocols such as Alchemix, Synthetix, Liquity, and Abracadabra use liquidity to protect their peg. Expiring derivative platforms such as UMA, and [rate speculation platforms](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/rate-speculation-platforms/) need liquidity to function prior to asset expiry. XTK has CLR pools to grant exit liquidity on staked assets with lock times. The list for this is endless. Acquiring liquidity at the necessary depth is costly. To add insult to injury, when a DAO incentivizes liquidity they do so with their governance token. This in turn necessitates sourcing even more liquidity in the form of a \"Pool-2\" farm (e.g. SPELL-ETH). Without this the price would just plummet, the emissions would be worthless, and the system would cease to function. This basically doubles the necessary emissions. Worse yet, the Pool 2's can't run on Curve which eliminates the option of renting or owning liquidity direction rights. A DAO's only recourse at that point is buying liquidity via bonds (limited depth) or renting liquidity via liquidity mining (high cost over time). Enter Tokemak.\n\nI have a longer blog post in draft that will include more information about Curve, Convex, Tokemak, and the future of liquidity mining but I think Tokemak is the least documented/understood of these projects. They recently released their long awaited [Gitbook](https://tokemak.gitbook.io/tokemak/toke/liquidity-direction/general). It's better than I feared and not as complete as I'd like. Let's talk about how this functions.\n\nHere we go: Tokemak has invented the 'modular dex'. This is akin to the recent meme of a modular blockchain. Here are the modules:\n\n1) Exchange\n\n2) Market Makers\n\n3) IL Insurance\n\n4) Liquidity Incentives\n\nAt it's core Tokemak makes revenue from trading fees. Despite that it is agnostic of a particular trading technology. It decouples asset ownership from asset management by explicitly creating a role for market makers and granting them governance rights (but not access) to decentralized liquidity. Unlike Bancor it decouples [IL insurance](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/protecting-against-impermanent-loss/) from the underlying exchange technology. Lastly, it adds extra liquidity incentives just like Convex has managed to without being exchange specific like CRV. Just like modular blockchains did to L1's, Tokemak challenges many assumptions we take for granted about dex's today.\n\nAt the very least, here is some stuff we know from the Gitbook:\n\n1) The system goes to [extreme lengths](https://tokemak.gitbook.io/tokemak/mechanics-and-functionality/guardrails-and-impermanent-loss-mitigation) to cover LP's IL. They take from the profit on a particular token first, then socialize the loss from the profit of other coins, then they drain the emission rewards for that reactor, then the staked TOKE of the liquidity directors is sacrificed, and lastly they draw from protocol controlled assets such as the DAO treasury. It's extremely robust. They are serious on this point. The result is safer assets which means less incentivization is required. Most one-sided staking pools offer less than half the APR of a pool 2. This implies DAO's can spend half as much incentivizing liquidity to join a Tokemak reactor.\n\n2) $1 of TOKE can deploy up to [$1.5 of tokens](https://tokemak.gitbook.io/tokemak/mechanics-and-functionality/deployment-logic) from the reactor, which is paired with another $1.5 from the genesis pool, leading to up to $3 of liquidity per $1 invested. It is *literally* a liquidity amplifier. This implies DAO's could spend 1/3 to 3/4 as much incentivizing liquidity as they currently do.\n\n3) Deposited assets return a 1:1 tToken. This is useful because it's a Defi lego that allows DAO's to convert their existing Pool 2 staking pools into tAsset pools. Combined with point 2, they can directly incentivize assets to deposit to the reactor.\n\n4) TOKE emissions stack on top of the protocol emissions and at least in the temporary sense will allow DAO's to net an equivalent APR using fewer of their own emissions.\n\nMy conclusion is that Tokemak is a more capital efficient mechanism to source liquidity for DAO's, especially for pool 2's. So let's talk about TOKE the token. Due to point 2 above, TOKE gains value proportional to the demand for liquidity depth across the ecosystem. It is similar to CVX this way, but not tied to a specific exchange. Liquidity demand has been growing exponentially. Aggregate liquidity demand is basically count of protocol * size of protocol. If you believe that new protocols will continue to form and in aggregate protocols are going to get bigger then you can conclude that demand for liquidity direction rights is going to be exponential. If you also believe that protocols will source their liquidity in the most capital efficient way they can and you believe my conclusion that Tokemak is more capital efficient than you can conclude that an exponential amount of liquidity is going to flood into Tokemak. And that, gentlemen and lady, means TOKE is also going to go exponential.\n\nSo ask yourself. What is the necessary liquidity depth for all of Defi and its incentivized pools? Let's say TOKE needs to be 1/3 of that. Do you think $352M is a fair answer?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I wrote <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qafrz4/daily_general_discussion_october_18_2021/hh2qrc6/\">recently</a> about liquidity renting vs liquidity ownership.

But maybe Polkadot could be useful for creating chains like Filecoin or Stellar or VET, I don&#39;t understand those chains very well, I just know they don&#39;t really compete with Ethereum.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 17:44:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhou3jz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t1_hho0v5f","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/towerjac","body":"The only thing that can stop Ethereum is an asteroid.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The only thing that can stop Ethereum is an asteroid.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 18:29:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhoz6pn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t3_qd9po7","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/skyfire-x","body":"Elon Musk catches a lot of flak for being Elon Musk, but colonizing Mars is a big first step in preserving human life and climbing up on the Kardashev scale.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Elon Musk catches a lot of flak for being Elon Musk, but colonizing Mars is a big first step in preserving human life and climbing up on the Kardashev scale.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 18:42:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhp0otx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t1_hhoz6pn","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/towerjac","body":"Well I just learned something.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Well I just learned something.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 19:00:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhp2vcm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t1_hhp0otx","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/ausgear1","body":"How is life on mars (a totally inhospitable planet where you\u2019ll have to make structures sealed from the outside with their own life support & water) and different to just wrecking this planet and then making those same structures here \n\nSeems like the only difference is that the cost of getting to mars is a major downside","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How is life on mars (a totally inhospitable planet where you\u2019ll have to make structures sealed from the outside with their own life support &amp; water) and different to just wrecking this planet and then making those same structures here </p>\n\n<p>Seems like the only difference is that the cost of getting to mars is a major downside</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 20:49:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhpen2g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t1_hhp0otx","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/dashby1","body":"I think there's a node on the ISS.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think there&#39;s a node on the ISS.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 18:33:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhozo5e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t1_hhoz6pn","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Sal_T_Nuts","body":"Funds are safu","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Funds are safu</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 18:35:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhozw7p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t1_hhozo5e","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/towerjac","body":"\ud83d\ude80","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\ud83d\ude80</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 18:39:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhp0czz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t1_hhozo5e","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"That\u2019s not sufficient decentralization if the world is destroyed, I\u2019m out.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That\u2019s not sufficient decentralization if the world is destroyed, I\u2019m out.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 19:39:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhp7ckl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t1_hhozo5e","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/bkcmart","body":"Cardano Solves this problem","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Cardano Solves this problem</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-22 19:07:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hhp3n3k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qd9po7","parent_id":"t1_hhoz6pn","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/towerjac","body":"Heeeelll yeah, we found something it can solve!
