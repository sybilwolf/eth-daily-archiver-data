The collection of these thoughts is a bit of a thesis on the inevitable evolution of how Defi sources liquidity towards a more sustainable, interconnected, and productive means. You can read the progress [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qafrz4/daily_general_discussion_october_18_2021/hh2qrc6/),[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qd9po7/daily_general_discussion_october_22_2021/hhl8dkv/) or you can jump to the blog post at the end.\n\nThe last thing I'd like to add for DAOs is some well-intentioned and unsolicited advice as Defi undergoes this inevitable transformation to sustainably sourcing liquidity.\n\nFirst. Stop overpaying for liquidity. Stop emitting a flat rate to staking pools. Have an explicit numeric target for your liquidity depth.

The collection of these thoughts is a bit of a thesis on the inevitable evolution of how Defi sources liquidity towards a more sustainable, interconnected, and productive means. You can read the progress <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qafrz4/daily_general_discussion_october_18_2021/hh2qrc6/\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/qd9po7/daily_general_discussion_october_22_2021/hhl8dkv/\">2</a> or you can jump to the blog post at the end.</p>\n\n<p>The last thing I&#39;d like to add for DAOs is some well-intentioned and unsolicited advice as Defi undergoes this inevitable transformation to sustainably sourcing liquidity.</p>\n\n<p>First. Stop overpaying for liquidity. Stop emitting a flat rate to staking pools. Have an explicit numeric target for your liquidity depth. Actively measure the elasticity of liquidity to incentive and pay only what you need. Adjust your emissions frequently. More emissions draw more liquidity certainly but they also suppress your token price which makes future emissions less effective. A well-reasoned emission structure therefore rents only as much as it needs to for its goals and uses the remaining emissions to grow the protocol in a more sustainable way.</p>\n\n<p>Bribes are currently very underpriced but the market for them is rapidly heating up.

I\u2019ve been looking at family pictures. I am not upset or emotional...I just feel like sharing some Intel that turned me into a well seasoned steak fry, instead of the small fry I used to be. I\u2019m still a damn fry, \n\nNever fear failure. If paralyzed by fear you will never truly push yourself. Figure out what you respect the most that makes you content and happy. Ignore the haters, and people who say you can\u2019t do it. Especially your family. While I built rigs, they all thought it was a crazy mistake. But I believed in this, and in  @vbuterin , and held true to my vision. It\u2019s important in life to have a mentor and a protege at the same time.\n\nYou must bend or break some rules. Not the law but rules, we have so many rules to follow. Nobody ever became a maverick or a true original without breaking some rules.  \n\nWork harder than you ever imagine. Champions of this planet start counting when they feel pain, because this when it really counts. It applies to athletics, business, education, relationships.  Real estate agents that stay on the phone hunting as many leads possible in a workday become the Ricky Romas of life. It\u2019s a universal truth, it applies to everything. There\u2019s no way around  working hard! I was always known for overtraining, because after a human suffers enough, the pain turns into something else. Something we all must find comfort in,.  No pain, no gain. \n\nWhile its fun to party, you must remember that there is someone out there training, becoming more intelligent, and working hard. My grandmother was a very poor farmer as a kid and teen. She wore pototo sacks to school,, but died a multi millionaire. My family is not rich, I am not bragging. Granny got Alzheimer\u2019s , and my moms sister convinced her in the confused mental state to sign 70 percent of what they left over to her family, including a Rolls Royce, and an estate. Granny, is in The Who\u2019s who of American women. Moms evil sister isn\u2019t, because she didn\u2019t follow these basic concepts of life, it led to her dating one of the most corrupt politicians or the last 40 years, married five times...and her son reminds me of Bobby from Horrihpe. Bosses 1. If I saw him compromised by four men outside a club or bar, I\u2019d disappear on him. I wouldn\u2019t disappear on people I respect, but I don\u2019t respect him - or his family. Excluding her current husband as he is a veteran who saw action in Vietnam. That said, his stories get worse and worse each holiday, when we used to have family holidays, before money and greed tore it apart. You cannot become victorious in any venture with idle hands. Two thousand years ago, an ancient Chinese warrior, Sun Tzu, said in ancient documents that every battle is won before it is fought, it is a fact. Work harder.\n\nOther than my parents, the best and smartest soul I know gives back to the community.  Lives like a monk in a concrete bunker, but he donates to help build parks for kids, and it was him who made me understand how important it is to give something back to your community.  The man would write a check and glow with a contentment I\u2019ve only witnessed in third world countries. There, you\u2019ll find that time with family is the most valuable thing on the planet. As a kid when asked what we wanted to be, most other boys would say fireman, policeman, doctor, teacher. I always said I wanted to be a good family man, because that\u2019s the beat a man can hope to be. Time with family is priceless because it is limited and precious.  Now, few months ago , I lost the perfect woman. But everything happens for a reason, now I have no choice but to choose war, like I said earlier, you have to clearly pick between those two to find contentment...this stems from an ancient text, thousands of years old.\n\nRemember, up and comers are always watching. If youth call a person sir or ma\u2019am out of respectt on their own , without being told to, they will replicate their actions. life is a circle. \n\nNever surrender, no matter what happens. The Alamo; 150 Texans garrisoned inside, listening to 1500 Mexican soldiers outside, several of them mariachis, constantly singing a song called the De Guellp, to intimidate the Americans inside. I believe the song is referred to as the cutthroat song, but I am not 100 percent. It took them ten days to defeat the 150, who all died with honor, on their feet. Ironically a Mexican named Carlos Zapata, a man those 1500 would call sir, has a quote \u201cbetter to die on your feet than on your knees\u201d without a doubt the majority of that Mexican army respected those 150 because of that kind of honor and loyalty displayed during their final moments.  If it gets hard and you quit, it\u2019ll turn you into a quitter because it\u2019ll be easier to go back to being okay with surrender. Kids see people they respect surrender, then they\u2019ll surrender later in life too. I knew Jones Jr would defeat Mike, I\u2019ve never seen Roy quit. I\u2019ve seen him brutally ko\u2019d. Mike surrendered four or five times, just in more subtle ways, like illegal techniques that disqualify you. So, no matter what, never quit. Not in athletics, education, business, war, or love. Sacrifice what you have to do, to keep your family and kids. I have none of my own (yet) but want them.  Losing them was like losing a piece of my spirit, so I choose war now. If I could build the perfect woman and kids from the ground up somehow, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.  I\u2019ll never be lucky enough to have this again, so war is choosing me, more than I\u2019m choosing war.\n\nTell your mother you love her. You only get one. Don\u2019t just call. Go see her. Pull up funny YouTube stuff like that Michael Bolton pirate song. Or that kpop stuff. My mom thinks kpop is great and I feel great to make her smile or laugh.  I have a picture of Sugar Ray Leonard posing with mom, and two other gentleman, he got us free tickets.  I was a baby. Sugar himself is an original maverick...he got there by breaking some rules. He was the second sugar, Robinson was the first. He was a maverick too. \n\nFinally, if you ever see someone being bullied, fight for them. Life is just a series of choices, make the wrong one and you regret it; making then right choices I believe make you a better person.  In closing, I have one final thing to say\n\nNO ETH STAKING - NO LIFE\n\nThese are some songs that I only listen to when it hurts, music can be powerful , it\u2019s more powerful to use it to push thru \n\nThis must be the place \nTalking Heads\nhttps://youtu.be/o9gK2fOq4MY\n\nAin\u2019t talkin bout love\nEddie Van Halen (RIP)\nhttps://youtu.be/Y-IUB62zDlA\n\nServe Somebody\nBob Dylan\nhttps://youtu.be/wC10VWDTzmU\n\nStranglehold\nTed Nugent  \nhttps://youtu.be/0c3d7QgZr7g\n\nLonely Teardrops\nMichael McDonald\nhttps://youtu.be/lh743kGZCTM\n\nAin\u2019t gonna suffer no more\nJohn Lee Hooker\nhttps://youtu.be/TVgPUyByk8U\n\nStrung Out\nAshes\nhttps://youtu.be/KfwjQQv4wr4\n\nAngel Eyes\nSting\nhttps://youtu.be/QS1MgqJ7B3Y\n\nEl Ciclista\nWidinson (Spanish )\nhttps://youtu.be/G10zbxDZQSs\nUn millon de cosas \nhttps://youtu.be/XimgIhrF9IQ\nProvinciana\nhttps://youtu.be/FW8vAixQAng\nDale Morena\nhttps://youtu.be/GWdU6AGflrs\nEl Camelon \nhttps://youtu.be/HDRqPx-v1tI\n\nTragedy shapeth strength  (Ukrainian)\nhttps://youtu.be/uvixeSrM0RA\n\nCareful with a fool\nJohnny Winter (RIP)\nhttps://youtu.be/8Tyg5SJDpiQ\nProdigal Son\nhttps://youtu.be/oJyc9uAlzxs\nMemory Pain\nhttps://youtu.be/lvQHOvSCimY\n\nRide hard, die free \nGadnium\nhttps://youtu.be/ruTjdFqrag4\n\nUptown hit\nKurios\nhttps://youtu.be/9Ptyz_1kNB0\n\nFather and son\nPaul Hertzog\nhttps://youtu.be/P-70asVPXZI\n\nBobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland\nAin\u2019t no love in the heart of the city\nhttps://youtu.be/WcF8Aos4XDA\n\nBiker Bar (instrumental )\nMike Figgis\nhttps://youtu.be/iDIb_0HI96Q\n\nEminem\nLike Toy Soldiers\nhttps://youtu.be/lexLAjh8fPA\n\nWreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\nGordon Lightfoot\nhttps://youtu.be/rFkyDB2InTs\n\nBlue Skies\nAl Jarreau \nhttps://youtu.be/hZD_d6xo1UQ\n\nCome rain or come shine \nDon Henley (live)\nhttps://youtu.be/lNS1fso1eeM\n\nState of mind\nSenser\nhttps://youtu.be/vceDtCLzpWM\n\nGroup Home\nSupa Star \nhttps://youtu.be/aSivytvw7G4\nSuspended in time\nhttps://youtu.be/ycQoolpbxqk\n\nBible Study (extended G1 version)\nhttps://youtu.be/BNqyvntMw7g\n\nStolen Car\nSpringsteen\nhttps://youtu.be/eS7tat0J5qQ\n\nA horse with no name\nAmerica \nhttps://youtu.be/zSAJ0l4OBHM\n\nMax and Sam Kellerman (RIP SAM)\nRumble young man rumble\nhttps://youtu.be/WF0DntqwMKg\n\nMoment of Truth (RIP PAT MORITA RIP JIMI JAMISON)\nhttps://youtu.be/9b_aQBf4D2I\n\nInstrumental Mos-def \u201cRespiration\u201d\nhttps://youtu.be/9b_aQBf4D2I\n\nHans Zimmer \u201cEnter the Arena\u201d\nhttps://youtu.be/xEx4VdnhWAY\n\u201cTime to Go\u201d\nhttps://youtu.be/sqbFY3-XK1U\nThe Contender extended (RIP Najai)\nhttps://youtu.be/s6TpPgbOnzQ\n\nFaces\nBad \u2018n ruin \nhttps://youtu.be/JZqWX-E7nOM\n\nMy rifle, pony and me\nDean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Walter Brennan (RIP)\nhttps://youtu.be/1uuAjwvtx\n\nAll that I want is you (instrumental )\nGhostface Killa and Mary.J Blige\nhttps://youtu.be/qVaamrP_hKw\n\nGhost of General Lee\nWaylon Jennings\nhttps://youtu.be/p-MX0PXDWis\n\nIn the ghetto\nElvis Presley\nhttps://youtu.be/2En0ZyjQgU4\n\nVictory Instrumental (start at :30)\nhttps://youtu.be/GoOLnBvJItQ\n\nRoll with the punches\nWarren Zevron\nhttps://youtu.be/cSpnAvvPqDk\n\nBring the pain\nMethod Man\nhttps://youtu.be/T0BlXy3Roj4\n\nAshes to ashes\nTarbox Ramblers\nhttps://youtu.be/PUXWQD9OpE0\n\nWe in da city\nYoung Dro\nhttps://youtu.be/Rh5ZQMlMmaA\n\nRemember Me\nLiam Wilson \nhttps://youtu.be/C65nj4SZkyA\n\nHits from the bong\nCypress Hill\nhttps://youtu.be/eMK4cfXj5c0\n\nOne Hundred Days\nMark Lanegan\nhttps://youtu.be/EYhzz4JQ6g4\n\nViking\nLos Lobos\nhttps://youtu.be/KyfwAgNtcYM\n\nThe old man comes around\nJohn Fogherty\nhttps://youtu.be/4AQrH9OCal0\n\nPigeonhead \nBattle Flag\nhttps://youtu.be/2WlrDZj14Mg\n\nHBO WCB Instrumental (from 1999)\nhttps://youtu.be/lNS1fso1eeM\n\nHBO 24/7 (extended instrumental)\nhttps://youtu.be/abwmzggQQrw\n\nHBO BAD Theme mid 90s\nhttps://youtu.be/WWif1omrnfw\n\nAnacott Steel\nWall Street 1987\nhttps://youtu.be/h8PLrkEXWnc\n\nBoiler Room intro speech\nGiovanni Ribisi \nhttps://youtu.be/kpQtdfmtd6s\n\nHow\u2019s that for a sh1tpost?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi eth fam.

Kids see people they respect surrender, then they\u2019ll surrender later in life too. I knew Jones Jr would defeat Mike, I\u2019ve never seen Roy quit. I\u2019ve seen him brutally ko\u2019d. Mike surrendered four or five times, just in more subtle ways, like illegal techniques that disqualify you. So, no matter what, never quit. Not in athletics, education, business, war, or love. Sacrifice what you have to do, to keep your family and kids. I have none of my own (yet) but want them.  Losing them was like losing a piece of my spirit, so I choose war now. If I could build the perfect woman and kids from the ground up somehow, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.  I\u2019ll never be lucky enough to have this again, so war is choosing me, more than I\u2019m choosing war.</p>\n\n<p>Tell your mother you love her. You only get one. Don\u2019t just call. Go see her. Pull up funny YouTube stuff like that Michael Bolton pirate song. Or that kpop stuff. My mom thinks kpop is great and I feel great to make her smile or laugh.  I have a picture of Sugar Ray Leonard posing with mom, and two other gentleman, he got us free tickets.  I was a baby. Sugar himself is an original maverick...he got there by breaking some rules. He was the second sugar, Robinson was the first. He was a maverick too. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you ever see someone being bullied, fight for them. Life is just a series of choices, make the wrong one and you regret it; making then right choices I believe make you a better person.  In closing, I have one final thing to say</p>\n\n<p>NO ETH STAKING - NO LIFE</p>\n\n<p>These are some songs that I only listen to when it hurts, music can be powerful , it\u2019s more powerful to use
