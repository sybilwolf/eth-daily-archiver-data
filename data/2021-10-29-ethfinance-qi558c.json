Not sure how many people are aware. But this is definitely news for me.\n\n[Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) has added the capability to withdraw funds to Arbitrum. I have not tried it yet. If you have tried, please let me know! $4 fee to withdraw a ERC20 (USDC for example). And 0.001 ETH fee to withdraw ETH (so about $4 as well). I have some ETH in Ledger/Metamask that I wanted to Bridge to Arbitrum. If I use the official Arbitrum bridge or Hop, I am looking at paying 0.03 ETH (so $120) in fees at current gas price. Even if I want to bridge when the gas price falls to 40 GWEI, that will still be at least 0.01 ($40) in fees.\n\nInstead, if I move my ETH from Ledger/Metamask to [Crypto.com](https://Crpyo.com) ($20 fees at current price and cheaper if you wait for 40-50 GWEI) and then bridge to Arbitrum for $4 fees, that seems a lot cheaper.\n\nIts not coinbase. Its not gemini. Its not Kraken. Its [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com) that has made this available. I am impressed! Who else is familiar about this?\n\nEdit - It just came to my thought about a potential airdrop hunt for using hop protocol. That could be worth it for trying it out once using ETH.

So many good bits of information in there.\n\nTLDR highlights:\n\n- the SHARP (shared prover) currently allows SoRare, Immutable and DeversiFi to share the computation costs of generating zk proofs with each other, leading to cheaper fees the more transactions happen. What does this mean? **Incredible network effects.** Other projects will want to get in on this because it makes everything cheaper for everyone involved. It's the (3,3) meme for blockchain networks.\n\n- Nethermind is building WARP, a solidity compiler. Erigon is building a full node for Starkware as well as another team called Equilibrium (I think). So even for rollups we'll have multiple clients for redundancy in case one client has issues.\n\n- Starkware's cryptography is much more battle-tested compared to similar approaches by other zk rollup teams\n\n- you can do a lot of cool shit in terms of gaming, lots of interest \n\n- in the DeFi sector, there are a lot of people looking to try out and build a lot of stuff - probably alluding to AAVE v3 and similar bluechips with new innovations\n\n- TikTok actually reached out to Starkware, and StarkWare referred TikTok to Immutable. TikTok gave Immutable 12 days for the integration and they pulled it off.\n\n- does StarkWare have interest in the traditional gaming giants, like Call of Duty etc? Answer: yes, very much so, and they have the scalability capacity to service all of that. the issue is that these game studios aren't clear on how the move from a closed ecosystem to an open ecosystem will affect their cash milking abilities. the StarkWare team points out that as is often the case with breakthrough innovations, that a new player that builds something new will take the first step, reaping the success, only then will older studios consider joining in on the tech.\n\n- hinting at a token 3-4 months from now (my interpretation)\n\n- 1 year or even less than that until we get decentralized provers + sequencers\n\nnow, two of my personal highlights:\n\n- even though dYdX runs in rollup mode (not validium) and tx fees should be higher, they have actually been lower than if it were a Validium. Why? Because dYdX features a ton of transactions that happen between two parties only - that means even though you have, say, 12k transactions in a single batch, the transactions only change the state of two parties, so they can batch them together extremely efficiently.\n\nAnyone remember how Solana proponents argue that Solana is the solution for high frequency trading and trading desks etc? I do. Little did they know this is actually orders of magnitudes faster and cheaper on a zk rollup like StarkNet, especially with SHARP (shared provers). Goddamn, I'm bullish. I'll probably write a tweet on that.\n\n- DeFi Pooling. Now, this is big and fucking bullish. By now, we've got several rollups live, but adoption isn't moving as fast as we'd like. We don't have all of the dapps available on rollups yet. What DeFi pooling does is that you can live entirely on the rollup with all of your assets. Then, you want to use, say, AAVE on mainnet. You submit your transaction, and everybody else who wants to do the same thing will get batched together, sharing the costs. This enables two things: Make every single dapp on mainnet accessible to use from Starkware, and it enables people to cheaply tap into mainnet's liquidity without having to pay the abhorrent gas fees.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/transacting-on-starkwares-live-zk-rollups-is-orders-of-magnitude-cheaper-with-the-security-of-ethereum-starkware-powered-gaming-and-building-a-vibrant-ecosystem-of-dapps/\">https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/transacting-on-starkwares-live-zk-rollups-is-orders-of-magnitude-cheaper-with-the-security-of-ethereum-starkware-powered-gaming-and-building-a-vibrant-ecosystem-of-dapps/</a></p>\n\n<p>I highly recommend listening to this podcast with the Starkware team.

I\u2019d been loosely following crypto since i lost 2k on shitcoins during the 18 crash and finally overcame my risk aversion in March, and have been buying as much ETH as I can since then. Point is there are a lot of people out there who have money to spend but either don\u2019t understand crypto/blockchain (eg they think it\u2019s all BTC or even worse DOGE SHIB type stuff), or have some understanding of it but are too risk averse (how I was). The former group will become educated as mass adoption begins to occur. The latter group will start to buy in once more price stability occurs which should come with adoption (and ETFs). I think all the time about where the liquidity will come from in the future, and it\u2019s not from the tech savvy risk tolerant crowd - their money is already in play. It\u2019s these people that will fuel future mass adoption and major price gains. Also a shout out to this community - good people - love my time here - and liberosist\u2026you are a fountain of knowledge. Thank you.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-29 11:32:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hijn3ci","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qi558c","parent_id":"t1_hij925f","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ethlongmusk","body":"Comment approved.

Granted, informal commerce in my country is notorious for avoiding taxes and our tax laws are... easily avoidable to say the least, but still, impressed.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, I did not pay &quot;Rafita&quot; in ETH as tacos are half a dollar so even with Arbitrum, transactions are expensive for that, but I&#39;ll sure as hell be coming back, one of these days I may be drunk enough to give you some of my ETH Rafita.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: He also takes BTC, but lets just forget about that one.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-29 19:27:39","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-10-29 19:42:58","id":"hilg0ep","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qi558c","parent_id":"t3_qi558c","score":35,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Diligent-Mouse3679","body":"[Deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[Deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-29 19:54:49","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-06-30 14:21:34","id":"hilj8cu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qi558c","parent_id":"t1_hilg0ep","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/breadAndButerin","body":"Maybe you could bite the bullet one of these days and pay a bit more for a taco, with ETH, just to support him.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Maybe you could bite the bullet one of these days and pay a bit more for a taco, with ETH, just to support him.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-10-29 21:06:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hilrceq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qi558c","parent_id":"t1_hilg0ep","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/thetjs1","body":"People that speak English as a second language always use touristic.

Hence he worked his ass off and did a great job. But he's also kind of fitting the stereotype you might know: he was really working each day, every day. He didn't develop a lot of emotional/ social intelligence, no empathy. Didn't spend a lot of time with us. \n\nAt the same time I see a lot of people of my age that were raised with a lot of money that are assholes.

Everyone is expecting money flows to be the same as last cycle. In 2013/2017, BTC was clearly the \"safety\" asset. Money would flow into the space in waves, starting with BTC, then ETH, then everything else. Both BTC peaks in 2013/2017 happened in Q4, roughly in December. In 2017, due to the flow of money referenced above, ETH reached it's peak price point about 3 weeks later in January.\n2. It's 2021 and the money flows have changed. Larger market caps alone make it much easier for investors to enter/exit digital assets compared to 2017. ETH is also the asset with the most regulatory clarity in the US (behind BTC). Raoul Pal recently mentioned that some institutions are now comfortable bypassing BTC and investing directly in ETH. These institutions are legally conservative, so short/mid term, I expect the larger asset managers to stay with ETH and BTC.\n3. Blah blah blah something about interest rates or inflation or something. Who cares? Staking ETH is the only asset these institutions can access that offers a trustless, inflation resistant yield. Even if ETH stays flat against the dollar for the next decade, the expected long-term yield from staking is still several multiples higher than what government bonds are offering today. As soon as banks have federal permission to custody digital assets, I find it hard to believe that every bank won't make a HARD shift into staking. They can collect the long term 5% or whatever from Ethereum and then give their customers a 3% interest rate. Customers think they're getting a great deal and the bank is both retaining customers and hedging against declining growth of customer deposits. I think there is an institutional meme here that hasn't caught on yet: \"ETH is cost-efficient\". One node setup can support hundreds of validator keys. For banks, ETH is not only an industry hedge and a trustless, non-sovereign, inflation resistant, high yield asset. It's also essentially pure profit margin for large scale node operators.\n4. BTC has become a reputation risk for institutions this year due to the ESG narrative. Argue all you want about whether or not POW is a waste of energy. Your argument doesn't matter. The public perception this year is that BTC is harmful to the environment. Any business that becomes deeply involved in BTC will need to have an explanation/response ready to go for that criticism. People sometimes talk about 99% reduction in energy usage for POS, but I think there's a meme the market is sleeping on here too: \"ETH is green BTC\". That narrative should definitely catch on near the merge. It also has the added benefit of probably winning over some ignorant politicians. \n5. Due to the complexity of this topic, many institutions are likely over-allocated to BTC right now. Last year, BTC seemed like the safe bet as the \"safe-haven\" asset of the last cycle. Today, it's clear that significant reputational risks and opportunity costs have arisen. \n6. People are idiots. Imagine how dumb the average person is, now remember that half of people are even dumber than that. We are in the stage of the market where everyone feels like a genius because number go up for 2 years. I see a general consensus that 2021 will mirror the 2017 cycle. People are expecting BTC peak, sell for ETH, BTC peak again. I don't think that will happen.\n7. Hear me out, you are a massive bank trying to maximize the value of your crypto allocation. You hold primarily BTC, which everyone is expecting to peak first. Somehow you want to move at least part of your position to ETH. What do you do?\n8. Pump ETH first. Historically, ETH/BTC has been incredibly bearish in Q4. Seasoned crypto people will mostly tell you \"ETH bleeds in Q4\" and they treat it as a given. What if ETH seems to peak in November 2021? That would be confusing and drive a bunch of retail FOMO that the banks can use as short-term exit liquidity. Then rotate ETH profits into BTC, driving up the price and adding fuel to the 4-year cycle narrative. BTC does peak in Dec/Jan in this hypothetical.\n9. Everyone assumes ETH already peaked. The bank sells BTC profits into ETH slightly later than expected in Q1 (to secure a more long-term staking position). Mid-2022, BTC falls in price more than ETH due to supply/demand dynamics (zero issuance for basically the entire second half of 2022). \n10. **The Flippening H2 2022**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s my mid-term bull case:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Everyone is expecting money flows to be the same as last cycle.
