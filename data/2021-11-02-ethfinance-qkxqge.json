Second, why a fixed size of 32 ETH, and not 1 ETH or 1000 ETH?\n\n>The problem with allowing variable balances is that algorithms for a random selection (eg. of block proposers) and shuffling (for committees) become much more complicated. You would need an algorithm to select a block proposer such that the probability that the algorithm selects a particular proposer is proportional to the proposer's balance, in a context where balances are changing and validators are always entering and exiting. This could be done with fancy binary tree structures but would be complicated. In the case of committee selection, a wealthy validator cannot be assigned to one committee (as they would then dominate and be able to attack it); their weight would need to be split up among many committees.

This implies that if the deposit size were reduced to 16 ETH, then the overhead of the chain would double, and the rewards to each validator would halve, so staking with a single validator slot would be four-times more difficult, already a potentially unsafe level.

It is risky, but I've managed to increase my total ETH stack by \\~18% over that timeframe.  Current positions are roughly:\n\n\\~60% in v3 LPs; 25% in Alchemix; 15% in Yearn\n\nA couple of amendments I would make:\n\n* With the low APR from the crvSTETH vault, I'm prioritizing building the Alchemix stack.  The 25% instant collateral availability is too juicy to pass up.  I do still have a goal amount to reach in Yearn, though (partly to diversify in the event of a hack or rug, and partly because you're exposed to different interest rate and other risks than the ETH vault)\n* Instead of selling ETH to DAI and then depositing in the Alchemix DAI vault, I have a 2-part plan to take profits:\n   * Create 1-sided ETH/USDC LPs somewhere above $10k\n      * This allows you to earn ETH and USDC fees during sideways chop, \"buy more\" ETH as ETH price declines, and cash out for profit as ETH price increases\n      * Also, **I'm not an accountant** but my understanding is the 1-sided LP should allow you to avoid a taxable event (selling ETH for USDC) until you remove the liquidity.  So let's say you deposit 100% ETH at $10k and set the upper bound for $12,000 (i.e. once ETH hits $12,001, your LP is 0% ETH/100% USDC).  If ETH hits $12,001 by December 20th, no problem.  You can just leave your LP in place until January 1, 2022, and you won't have another taxable event in 2021 because you never technically \"sold\" (of course you'll still need to pay in spring 2023)\n   * Accumulate and hodl a target amount of alETH, sell for USDC at target prices (e.g. $10k, $12.5k, $15k, $20k), transfer cash into stock market\n\nThe above is not financial advice.  I'm interested to hear any feedback or if anything looks off to anyone.  Happy ATH day and here's to many more in 2021!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Updating a comment from September 23rd: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pto076/daily_general_discussion_september_23_2021/hdywx1f/?context=3\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pto076/daily_general_discussion_september_23_2021/hdywx1f/?context=3</a></p>\n\n<p>So far this strategy is working quite well.  It is risky, but I&#39;ve managed to increase my total ETH stack by ~18% over that timeframe.  Current positions are roughly:</p>\n\n<p>~60% in v3 LPs; 25% in Alchemix; 15% in Yearn</p>\n\n<p>A couple of amendments I would make:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>With the low APR from the crvSTETH vault, I&#39;m prioritizing building the Alchemix stack.  The 25% instant collateral availability is too juicy to pass up.  I do still have a goal amount to reach in Yearn, though (partly to diversify in the event of a hack or rug, and partly because you&#39;re exposed to different interest rate and other risks than the ETH vault)</li>\n<li>Instead of selling ETH to DAI and then depositing in the Alchemix DAI vault, I have a 2-part plan to take profits:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create 1-sided ETH/USDC LPs somewhere above $10k\n\n<ul>\n<li>This allows you to earn ETH and USDC fees during sideways chop, &quot;buy more&quot; ETH as ETH price declines, and cash out for profit as ETH price increases</li>\n<li>Also, <strong>I&#39;m not an accountant</strong> but my understanding is the 1-sided LP should allow you to avoid a taxable event (selling ETH for USDC) until you remove the liquidity.  So let&#39;s say you deposit 100% ETH at $10k and set the upper bound for $12,000 (i.e. once ETH hits $12,001, your LP is 0% ETH/100% USDC).  If ETH hits $12,001 by December 20th, no problem.  You can just leave your LP in place until January 1, 2022, and you won&#39;t have another taxable event in 2021 because you never technically &quot;sold&quot; (of course you&#39;ll still need to pay in spring 2023)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Accumulate and hodl a target amount of alETH, sell for USDC at target prices (e.g. $10k, $12.5k, $15k, $20k), transfer cash into stock market</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The above is not financial advice.

I guess I can&#39;t look at it exactly as you say because I didn&#39;t set my sell targets based on total net proceeds but rather sell a certain % of my ETH every time the price increases 20% (not the exact number).  So I&#39;m less concerned about locking in a specific amount of money but more that I want to make sure I am taking some money off the table as we move up in case we see some sort of repeat of January 2018.</p>\n\n<p>*again made up numbers</p>\n\n<p>But your point about this being a slippery slope is a really important one because your scenario of selling all $10,000 ETH AND $11,000 ETH earlier and earlier is precisely what I don&#39;t want to do and really the point of the selling plan in the first place.  Especially because I am kind of already shortchanging myself when I set my limit orders.  If my plan calls for selling at $4,500, when I enter my order I always go for like $4,498 so I don&#39;t miss out on a sell due to the bias for round numbers.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-02 13:50:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hj25m9g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qkxqge","parent_id":"t1_hj22sn3","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Bob-Rossi","body":"See... with the benefit of hindsight we did hit $4,600!\n\nMaybe the fix is adjusting your targets to account for this 50/50 method as you get close?

I know I&#39;d love to see it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been trying to snipe my preferred domain for a while; the previous registrant let it lapse but it&#39;s sitting in the 90 day grace period. Hoping I can snag it, frustrated I never moved forward on a couple other domains this summer, not unlike yourself.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-02 08:04:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hj0oxhc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qkxqge","parent_id":"t1_hj0kx2w","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/stablecoin","body":"To be a public good you want the token to get into as many hands as possible.

Yes, we need to move to renewables and yes we need to move there fast but they aren't infallible.

What I am trying to say is that many of the technologies which will shape the future aren't actually ready yet like solid state batteries. Lithium ion batteries are really bad both in terms of carbon footprint and non-carbon footprint. For example the carbon emissions from buying a new EV are actually greater than the equivalent of making and driving a ICE car for 10 years.

By all means, do the right thing and get an EV, you're signalling to manufacturers that we don't want to keep on the same unsustainable path, but buying an EV to replace your perfectly fine ICE vehicle?
