I use one story of mine a lot when explaining it to people. I played this game called Smite (MOBA like LOL) on Xbox and put hundreds of hours in. I collected tons of skins for every character and even spent real money buying gems to buy skins. I ended up quitting after a couple years and if the skins were NFT\u2019s I could sell all of them to at least recoup my money spent or even turn a profit. I know it wouldn\u2019t be a lot of money but let\u2019s say $100 for years of play. If I could do that as a 10 year old I\u2019d be going nuts!

The utility of NFTs is evolving, its no longer just holding for profit/flip, art aspects/historical aspects. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m proabley late to realizing this, but NFT DAOs treasuries raising funding from NFT drops/Royalties, then buying yield producing/appreciating assets. It becomes OHM 2.0. You can start talking profit sharing too (like dividend stocks!) based off how strong the community/brand is, and the utility. There will be some really interesting utility and game theory in the future, I was never too interested in the art aspect but the community/DAO/brand/utility aspect of NFTs is crazy interesting to me.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-03 10:41:07","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-11-03 10:46:03","id":"hj6bci5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qlo2v9","parent_id":"t3_qlo2v9","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/motionick","body":"I think many people, even eth heads, assume NFTs only mean animal profile pic\n\nI launched an NFT project with another eth financer a few months ago and it\u2019s been the most amazing life changing experience ever. \n\nWe are currently building an interactive planet manager for all our initial token holders.\n\nThere\u2019s sooo much potential for NFTs once you look beyond the surface","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think many people, even eth heads, assume NFTs only mean animal profile pic</p>\n\n<p>I launched an NFT project with another eth financer a few months ago and it\u2019s been the most amazing life changing experience ever. </p>\n\n<p>We are currently building an interactive planet manager for all our initial token holders.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s sooo much potential for NFTs once you look beyond the surface</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-03 10:48:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hj6ck06","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qlo2v9","parent_id":"t1_hj6bci5","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/unthinkablecryto","body":"But even animal profile pics can have what I'm talking about.

(after whatever number of conformations passed)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes. The value shown on the site that you&#39;re referring to is the maximum gas price (per unit) you&#39;re willing to pay for your transaction, but it&#39;s only one of the two parameters that you have to set when sending a transaction.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I don&#39;t know what you can set on the Ethermine payout settings but if it&#39;s only one parameter they&#39;re probably using the legacy method, so you only need to set the number similar to the fee cap you&#39;re reading off the site.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re going to initiate other transactions with a wallet that supports EIP-1559 consider this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BaseFee: minimum gasprice that a tx has to pay to be included in the block\n\nMaxGasPrice: max gasprice that the sender is willing to pay\n\nMaxPriorityFee: max gasprice that the sender is willing to pay to the miner\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Quick example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Next block BaseFee: 150\nYour Tx has:\nMaxGasPrice: 200\nMaxPriorityFee: 2 \nEffectiveGasPrice: 152 \nThe 200-152 Gwei difference won&#39;t be &quot;billed&quot; as fees.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t set the values right you&#39;re going to overpay, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Next block BaseFee: 150\nYour Tx has\nMaxGasPrice: 200 \nMaxPriorityFee: 60 \nEffectiveGasPrice: 200 \nYou&#39;re spending more than you could have if you had set the priority fee correctly.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If Ethermine uses the legacy transaction type, it&#39;s basically the second example every time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Also consider using the polygon payout method if it suits your needs.
