Optimizing Yield for LP providers. In the long term, this will eventually be across multiple ETH L2s. Allowing users to freely move MIMs from different Layers easily. Staked ICE will take a portion of the revenue earned on the platform and redistribute it.</p>\n\n<p>And since MIM is cross chain/layers, it will eventually allow for 0 fee cross chain swaps and bridging, Leveraged Yield Positions, and more. Combined with Popsicle Finance, the possibilities between the two platforms are amazing. </p>\n\n<p>I believe it could eventually make DeFi and switching between different ETH layers trivial for users, to the point where they don&#39;t even need to know what chain or layer they are on.</p>\n\n<p>And the best part is Staked Spell and Staked Ice tokens don&#39;t need to be sold to realize value. They are/will be taken as collateral on Abracadabra, and users could borrow MIMs.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m still a bit iffy on TIME. The idea of a Decentralized VC Fund is not something new (i.e. Ethereum DAO hack). However, the use of revenue earned from protocol owned funds to fund startups is something novel and worth keeping an eye on. TIME holders vote on what projects to fund and if the projects are eventually successful the value is instantly returned to TIME holders since TIME is a representation of the what the Protocol owns.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Only problem with TIME is it&#39;s solely in the AVAX system. If the protocol could begin owning ETH via the bonding mechanism I would be a bit more certain on the success of it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-05 09:54:40","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-11-05 11:03:20","id":"hjfplyh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qn4lsp","parent_id":"t3_qn4lsp","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pooh9911","body":"Daniele built thing that people wanted to use, but also simultaneously speedrunning a cult and infinity risk while at it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Daniele built thing that people wanted to use, but also simultaneously speedrunning a cult and infinity risk while at it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-05 10:15:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hjfsvru","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qn4lsp","parent_id":"t1_hjfplyh","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Revanchist1","body":"Remember when Andre Cronje was the flavor of the month.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Remember when Andre Cronje was the flavor of the month.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-05 11:04:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hjg0dah","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qn4lsp","parent_id":"t1_hjfsvru","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Best_coder_NA","body":"Too much alpha ser.

In Ethereum we have validators (block proposers, like miners) and nodes (light-weight software that verifies these blocks according to network rules).\n\nIn Solana, nodes are tied to Validators. They perform all the same work and have the same hardware requirements as validators - so if you run a node, you might as well validate the network. Now, why is this problematic?\n\nTo run an Ethereum node, it takes a Raspberry Pi and a 1TB SSD. Fairly affordable, not perfect, but will be optimized in the future with upgrades like statelessness.\n\nTo run a Solana node, you need upwards of $5k in hardware, 100Gbit/s connection. So essentially, a server in a data center. Because these costs are so high, it makes no sense for any average Joe to run a node.\n\nWhy is this an issue? A network is only useful when anyone can verify it. It's the absolute basis of a blockchain network: if you are not able to verify the network, then you have to trust other people's nodes. Trust is the antithesis to blockchain networks. Trustless is the entire reason why these networks exist.\n\nSo, I can't verify a network unless I drop $5k+ on a data center server. Not only that, but data center servers are easier to take down: imagine a nation state, world war, black swan event - people that run nodes at home (Ethereum) are vastly harder to compromise/cut off than some servers in a huge data center.\n\nIn the conversations I had with Anatoly (CEO of Solana Labs), it became clear to me that Solana has no interest to make it easier to run nodes for people.\n\nSolana operates under the assumption that if you reward people that run nodes, more people will run nodes. Which is true, but the amount of nodes solely increases network resiliency - there are more copies of the network state. What Solana does not acknowledge at all is the ability for anyone to verify the network.\n\nThe next bad effect is that Solana validators continually require newer and newer hardware to keep scaling the network. So while validators are handsomely rewarded, they also need to spend a ton of money to keep their hardware up to date. \n\nBased on this, you have 1. a continued cost increase 2. a continued expense -> there's a baseline cost of running a node that will never drop.\n\nIn other words, the cost to run a Solana node will always be in firmly unreachable territory for poor people, thus it makes the network inherently trusted and not trustless.\n\nEdit: Let me expand.\n\nDue to Solana processing a ton of transactions (you'll get worthless spam txs if fees are that low), Solana's state is multiple Terabytes already and will grow exponentially.

In Ethereum we have validators (block proposers, like miners) and nodes (light-weight software that verifies these blocks according to network rules).</p>\n\n<p>In Solana, nodes are tied to Validators. They perform all the same work and have the same hardware requirements as validators - so if you run a node, you might as well validate the network. Now, why is this problematic?</p>\n\n<p>To run an Ethereum node, it takes a Raspberry Pi and a 1TB SSD. Fairly affordable, not perfect, but will be optimized in the future with upgrades like statelessness.</p>\n\n<p>To run a Solana node, you need upwards of $5k in hardware, 100Gbit/s connection. So essentially, a server in a data center. Because these costs are so high, it makes no sense for any average Joe to run a node.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this an issue? A network is only useful when anyone can verify it. It&#39;s the absolute basis of a blockchain network: if you are not able to verify the network, then you have to trust other people&#39;s nodes. Trust is the antithesis to blockchain networks. Trustless is the entire reason why these networks exist.</p>\n\n<p>So, I can&#39;t verify a network unless I drop $5k+ on a data center server. Not only that, but data center servers are easier to take down: imagine a nation state, world war, black swan event - people that run nodes at home (Ethereum) are vastly harder to compromise/cut off than some servers in a huge data center.</p>\n\n<p>In the conversations I had with Anatoly (CEO of Solana Labs), it became clear to me that Solana has no interest to make it easier to run nodes for people.</p>\n\n<p>Solana operates under the assumption that if you reward people that run nodes, more people will run nodes. Which is true, but the amount of nodes solely increases network resiliency - there are more copies of the network state. What Solana does not acknowledge at all is the ability for anyone to verify the network.</p>\n\n<p>The next bad effect is that Solana validators continually require newer and newer hardware to keep scaling the network. So while validators are handsomely rewarded, they also need to spend a ton of money to keep their hardware up to date. </p>\n\n<p>Based on this, you have 1. a continued cost increase 2. a continued expense -&gt; there&#39;s a baseline cost of running a node that will never drop.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the cost to run a Solana node will always be in firmly unreachable territory for poor people, thus it makes the network inherently trusted and not trustless.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Let me expand.</p>\n\n<p>Due to Solana processing a ton of transactions (you&#39;ll get worthless spam txs if fees are that low), Solana&#39;s state is multiple Terabytes already and will grow exponentially. They are already off-loading this huge amount of data to Arweave, a decentralized storage protocol. So essentially, Solana is already off-loading a critical function of what the nodes <strong>should</strong> do to a different protocol that may or may not exist in the future. </p>\n\n<p>If you are worried about low fees and the whole narrative that comes with that, you need to be aware that Ethereum&#39;s zk rollups + data sharding outscale Solana by a factor of 100x-100,000x.</p>\n\n<p>With Solana, to keep scaling the network, the thousands of validators have to keep upgrading their hardware.
