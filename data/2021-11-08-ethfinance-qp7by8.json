Let me tell you *why* Rocket Pool is so special.\n\n**Rocket Pool is Trustless** - Rocket Pool exists as a series of smart contracts that take custody of deposits and maintain that custody throughout the entire staking process. Other platforms that claim to be trustless or smart contract based have weak spots or multi signature authority, but in Rocket Pool there is never a moment when any person or group of people could take control of your funds, this is important for security and composability.\n\n**Rocket Pool is Decentralized** - Rocket Pool is a software service provider (they are not a hosting service), they provide the tools to run pooled staking nodes and make small deposits to participate in those pools. Operators from anywhere in the world can run minipools from home, or deposit small amounts of Eth for staking and receive the rEth token. This system increases access to staking and further decentralizes the beacon chain. Other providers put the network at risk by running all of their staking nodes in one or even ten locations - with Rocket Pool, first hundreds, then thousands of nodes will be spread all over the world.\n\n**Rocket Pool is Open Source** - [All of the code](https://github.com/rocket-pool) for Rocket Pool is public and open source. This has two benefits: It improves security by increasing the number of eyes looking for errors, and it sustains the competitiveness of the industry by sharing good ideas rather than hoarding them. If Rocket Pool succeeds, it will succeed amongst competition, not in a vacuum.\n\n**Rocket Pool is Liquid** - The rEth staked token is completely fungible, rewards accrue on the token with no need for re-basing. This means you can have ALL of the value of a liquid token while still earning staking rewards on that token.\n\n**Rocket Pool increases client diversity** - Rocket Pool quickly hopped on the client diversity train and provides single-click installation for node operators to use any client implementation (Nimbus, Teku, Lighthouse, Prysm). This is good for the health of the network, and it's something that no other service has provided. \n\n**Rocket Pool is composable** - Composability can't happen without strong security assumptions, it comes with assumptions that the underlying system is free from human interevention and robust. Systems that rely on multisig wallets or coin custody can't be composable because offering that ability weakens the whole system. Rocket Pool is fully smart contract based, and and the rEth token is fully liquid, this makes it a perfect candidate for integration with other systems.\n\n**Rocket Pool is permissionless** Any person who wants to stake as a node operator (with about 18 Ether) or as a client (with as little as 0.01 Ether) can take part in Rocket Pool. There is no sign up, no KYC to participate, it's all contract based so there are no gatekeepers. Rocket Pool extends access to staking to people who previously couldn't afford to stake and were forced to stake with exchanges.\n\nI like to ask the question, \"If everyone staked Ether using this method, what would happen to the network?\" Well, in the case of Rocket Pool, the network would be highly inclusive, diversified, and decentralized. It adds another layer of governance (through the RPL token), and it has risks associated with the complex world of smart contracts, but I wholly believe the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nWhen I play the character of superphiz, I hold Ethereum and products built on it to the highest standards. While I try not to trash anything, I do work hard to promote the gems, and Rocket Pool is one of these gems. I don't care if you participate in Rocket Pool financially, but I **DO** want you to understand why it's a big deal for our ecosystem.\n\nRocket Pool is going to launch in about twelve hours. Our [EthStaker](https://reddit.com/r/ethstaker) crew will be hosting a call that lasts about 2 hours beginning 4:30 Central time. I truly hope you'll join us and welcome an age of greater accessibility to staking that promotes the health of the beacon chain, [here's a link to our YouTube stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM1decziXkQ).
