I listened for probably an hour before I had to log off.  I admit I'm not a programmer or developer and only have a surface-level understanding of things like the blockchain trilemma, data sharding, the merge, proof of work vs. proof of stake, etc.  And yes I have \"bag bias\" because I hold no BTC (although I used to).  But it seemed to me like CK came off very poorly in the conversation.  Here were a few talking points that I wanted to comment on and see if anyone else has thoughts:\n\n* Ethereum is apparently controlled by a \"global cabal\" of insiders who are friends of Vitalik and other core devs (lol).  Also the high network activity + fees we see in bull markets is fake, because the activity is mostly made up of these billionaire insiders arbitraging value with bots to leech money.\n\nFirst of all, it's hilarious to me to think Vitalik is leading any sort of insider wealth creation cabal.  Vitalik is probably the least greedy leader in crypto.  I've never seen him comment about the ETH price, and everything he does is just trying to make the network more efficient, more scalable, and cheaper for the everyday user, while maintaining decentralization and security.  He also has literally donated over a billion dollars to charity and burned substantially more into thin air.\n\nSecond, it turns out if you have a decentralized network where anyone can invest in the token and transact on the network, a 60-year-old billionaire will have an advantage over a college student who can only afford to buy $50/month in ETH.  That's just how the world works.  But it's also true that ETH (and BTC to an extent) levels the playing field by wresting control from banks and corporations and redistributing autonomy to the people.  Just look at the ENS airdrop, which delivered thousands of dollars to over 100,000 users (hilariously, CK said something about the ENS aidrop only going to the cabal too. Which, wow, Vitalik must have a lot of friends).  Imagine if Facebook or Uber or Twitter did the same thing.\n\n* The PoW energy narrative is actually a good thing for Bitcoin.  It fixes energy infrastructure design, because e.g. in places like the Congo, profits from PoW mining incentivizes government to innovate with power distribution.\n\nTo me, this is just grasping at straws trying to turn a negative into a positive.  Even if you agree that BTC can help pull some of these poorer nations out of poverty by redistributing resources, IMO BTC has already lost the energy narrative.  And perhaps more than that, these profits are just short-term solutions.  Every BTC halving will require more and more energy to maintain PoW.  What happens 20 years from now when mining rewards are 3.125% (1/2\\^5) of what they are today?  What if price/demand doesn't keep up enough for mining to be worthwhile?\n\n* Justin Drake and anyone else who thinks ETH has the solution and BTC is unsustainable in the long-term just doesn't understand Bitcoin\n\nThis point was just kind of sad.  It clearly demonstrates that CK and other BTC maxis are so worried about being dethroned that they'll resort to ad hominem attacks, *because they can't argue on the technical merits*.  CK straight up admits he \"doesn't understand ETH\" and doesn't keep up with the dev progress.  The conversation really should have just stopped there.  If you don't understand ETH's roadmap and how PoS + roll-ups + data sharding inverts the blockchain trilemma and allows for decentralization + scalability + security, how can you possibly have a debate?  It would be like my grandpa hating the Internet when he doesn't even own a computer or smart phone.  How do you even have a conversation about the merits if he doesn't know what it is?\n\nAnyway there was much more to the conversation, but overall it was basically just CK getting agitated and being fairly condescending about anything ETH-related, which I guess makes for entertaining listening.\n\nI consider myself to be fairly open-minded.  I do think there is a place for BTC in crypto-- I just think it's a much smaller part of the future than ETH is.  It's sad to me that BTC maxis can't take the same perspective and see, while BTC paved the way and should be respected, ETH is an even more exciting innovation that has a place in the ecosystem.\n\nI'm interested to hear if anyone else listened or has other thoughts.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong><em>Long post warning</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Did anyone listen to the Twitter Space conversation w/ David Hoffman and Christian Keroles last night?

I guess a geometric mean is more useful given the outsized nature of those rare huge tips - in that case, the recent geometric mean is more like 0.11 ETH/block.\n\nIn any case, it would be useful to have access to historical tip data so as to model this stuff (I could, for instance, see Beacon Chain letting validators know where in the cumulative probability distribution their proposal fell, as a fun little gamification).
