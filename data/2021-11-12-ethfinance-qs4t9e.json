Welcome!\n\n**Step 1** is getting a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor, Gridplus, etc). Don't keep your whole ETH stack on a hot wallet (like Metamask, or any wallet that is connected to the internet). Learn how it works. Never, EVER share your seed phase with ANYONE... Never, EVER, type it online, for ANY reason...\n\n**Step 1.5** is getting a hot wallet. Start by installing the most used one, ie Metamask. Install the web-browser extension. Get it from the official Metamask site: https://metamask.io/download.html\n\n**Step 2** is using something like:\n\n[Zapper.fi](https://Zapper.fi)\n\n[Zerion.io](https://Zerion.io)\n\n[https://debank.com/](https://debank.com/)\n\nThese are sites that show you the - almost - complete picture of how much and where your funds are, on Ethereum and most Layer 2 networks. They do not control your funds, they just help you track them..\n\n**Step 3** is experimenting, just to get a feel of how the whole UI functions. Leave a small amount of ETH on the hot wallet (1-2 ETH, or a very small % of your stack), and try everything... Uniswap (nothing fancy, no Liquidity Provi until you fully understand what Impermanent Loss is), OpenSea, etc...\n\n**Step 4** (you might even try this instead of step 3, if you are very fee-conscious..). Try the various Layer 2 networks mentioned above.

Welcome!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong> is getting a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor, Gridplus, etc). Don&#39;t keep your whole ETH stack on a hot wallet (like Metamask, or any wallet that is connected to the internet). Learn how it works. Never, EVER share your seed phase with ANYONE... Never, EVER, type it online, for ANY reason...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1.5</strong> is getting a hot wallet. Start by installing the most used one, ie Metamask. Install the web-browser extension. Get it from the official Metamask site: <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download.html\">https://metamask.io/download.html</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong> is using something like:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://Zapper.fi\">Zapper.fi</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://Zerion.io\">Zerion.io</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://debank.com/\">https://debank.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>These are sites that show you the - almost - complete picture of how much and where your funds are, on Ethereum and most Layer 2 networks. They do not control your funds, they just help you track them..</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong> is experimenting, just to get a feel of how the whole UI functions. Leave a small amount of ETH on the hot wallet (1-2 ETH, or a very small % of your stack), and try everything... Uniswap (nothing fancy, no Liquidity Provi until you fully understand what Impermanent Loss is), OpenSea, etc...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong> (you might even try this instead of step 3, if you are very fee-conscious..).

But recently you guys know that things havent quite been so cheap for Ethereum users.</p>\n\n<p>v4 of PoolTogether is multi-chain and allows deposits into a &#39;megapool&#39; from any other chain. Currently v4 supports Polygon and Ethereum with USDC. But i am hearing rumblings of an Avalanche launch in our governance discussions. Maybe we can relaunch the Pod on a more UX friendly chain.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: The site dev just did a little bit of conversion and has worked out that 1 pDAI (your pod ticket) will now claim back 1.017 DAI. So 1.7% gain. Hey, its not the best rate in Defi by a long shot but its still better than your bank \ud83d\ude05</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-12 11:59:55","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-11-12 13:46:07","id":"hkdf0rb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qs4t9e","parent_id":"t3_qs4t9e","score":49,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/JayPeaEm","body":"Congratz /r/EthFinance on winning \ud83d\udc33\ud83d\udc2c\n\nBoo gas fees (*boooooo*)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Congratz <a href=\"/r/EthFinance\">/r/EthFinance</a> on winning \ud83d\udc33\ud83d\udc2c</p>\n\n<p>Boo gas fees (<em>boooooo</em>)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-12 12:23:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hkdibut","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qs4t9e","parent_id":"t1_hkdf0rb","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/chris_dea","body":"Well, I'll be damned...

This harkens on the the most human aspect of humanity, the reason we aren't hiding in trees from lions right now. Humans are a branch of biological evolution that optimized for information processing capability used to create and capitalize on information asymmetry to manipulate our environment towards improved individual fitness. You can create any contrived environment and throw a group of humans into it and in short order a subset will be poking and prodding at the constraints of said environment to game it zero sum to their advantage. This is the same reason why building robust, stable governance models is so difficult because humans are innately incentivized to exploit it. Money is this behavioral incentive technology we created which is basically a surrogate or culmination for all of our biological fitness drives.
