There are no guard rails, there is no one you can sue, there is no one the government can point a gun at, and there is no FDIC insurance that is going to bail you out. Once you leave the safety of an exchange and you are in custody of your funds if you fuck something up it is literally gone forever.\n\nIn my few short years in Defi I have personally narrowly dodged half a dozen hacks and been caught in at least two. When a hack does happen I'll usually track down the technical retrospective just out of morbid curiosity even if I wasn't affected. I am someone with decades of software background who has audited contracts personally before putting money in. I know enough Solidity to at least have written my own Defi project and to recognize the code origin many projects are forked from. Despite all of that, I have still been caught more than once. Suffice to say, if I can't see it coming the majority of investors who just know how to use a hardware wallet are hopelessly out of their depth. Seasoned veterans in this space will resonate with this next statement. Even if you do everything right sometimes you can still lose. To quote Picard: \"**It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness -- that is life**\" So, let's talk a bit about what this ecosystem does when *things go wrong*.\n\nToo often DAOs have no explicit plan for how to respond to a hack until one happens. It is at that moment that the culture and values of a DAO are put to the test. Despite this being the Wild West, there is a theme of good faith efforts from quality projects to do right by their users. Let's go over the different approaches DAOs have taken when the worst happens.\n\nOne of the more common approaches to reimbursement has been around a long while. Basically you repay those harmed using future revenue. You create a token, issue it to those affected, and allow them to redeem it as revenue allows. The earliest example of this I'm aware of wasn't even Defi. Rather it was [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/wp-2019-05.pdf). In 2016 Bitfinex was hacked and lost almost 120k BTC. Rather than simply default, they socialized the loss across their customers balances and issued BFX, a bond token, that was redeemable for $1 for each $1 lost in the hack. They then siphoned exchange fees to a pool that allowed customers to redeem their BFX token. [Harvest](https://medium.com/harvest-finance/announcing-the-grain-claims-portal-20dd12c4f631) in Dec 2020 followed an almost identical approach with the introduction of their GRAIN token. They gave everyone 1 GRAIN per $1 lost in the hack and directed future revenue to a grain buyback market. Then they added liquidity mining on the GRAIN/USDC market. If your protocol has enough revenue to repay the loss in a reasonable timespan and you can get governance token holders to agree to it this is an honest approach that's a good compromise between user opportunity cost (reimbursed by farming yield) and DAO loss (lost revenue and added issuance).\n\nThe next approach tilts more heavily on the side of DAO loss. Basically, the DAO can repay users from its' treasury. This is tricky because when a hack happens the governance token price craters. If your protocol has no reserve assets other than its governance token then if you use the governance token as reimbursement the tokens you're reimbursing with aren't going to hold their value and it's going to greatly harm the DAOs ability to provide incentives. [Yearn](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1359108691677614080) had the simplest approach to this. Rather than paying users out in YFI, they took a loan on Maker using their YFI and repaid the $11M loss in DAI. They also explicitly said this was a one-off event and to buy your own insurance next time. [XToken](https://medium.com/xtoken/rxtk-mechanics-272873488346), instead of taking a loan, used a timed release mechanism to give the token time to stabilize before the sell pressure of reimbursement hit. Mechanically, they issued an rXTK token that can be redeemed for more XTK over time the longer you delay claiming (up to a year). It's a simple workaround to the problem and it's not as though there was an XTK vault on Maker they could use.\n\nPerhaps the most novel approach I've seen is to just, uh, ask nicely for the funds back? When [Alchemix](https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/150-aleth-return-program) had their red carpet exploit, rather than [threatening users](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1443730726751506432) they created an NFT to commemorate good citizens and celebrated their community. Carrot works better than hollow stick as it turns out. If I had to generalize the concept to include black hat scenarios I'd say their approach of offering NFT incentives to fundraise and commemorate helping out in a time of need is a *capital efficient* strategy compared to the alternatives discussed above. Really, it's amazing how much they got back and how it brought the community together. I personally was an asshole, but at least I feel bad about it.\n\nComing up I'll be talking about proactive rather than reactive approaches DAOs and users can take.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There&#39;s a warning I give every newcomer to this space; this is the frontier.

I think the actual amount of money laundering going on is blown way out of proportion. If you have money to launder, there are many other ways of doing it. For example mining blocks with huge fees, tornado.cash, traditional methods. The truth is that 99.5% of NFT sales are just the result of a speculative bubble. However, to the uninitiated on the ins and outs of the NFT game it&#39;s easier to just say &quot;oh its all money laundering lol&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Also worth noting is that if you&#39;re a normal criminal you have dollars to launder, not crypto. So you somehow need to turn all of that cash into ETH without anyone noticing. Most regulated exchanges would notice. This means that NFTs are only good for laundering crypto which has been acquired illicitly which is of course a limited market.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-14 16:33:34","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-11-14 16:43:43","id":"hknqwyo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qtjebc","parent_id":"t1_hknq4ui","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sm3gh34d","body":"Ah dang good point about laundering via block production.
