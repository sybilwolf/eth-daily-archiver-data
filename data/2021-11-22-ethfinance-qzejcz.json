A funny cat picture qualifies on a short timescale, but any idea can become memetic if it spreads virally.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re very right that Bitcoin represents decentralization to a lot of people right now, because it&#39;s the most well-known example of it. But while decentralization as an idea might be a bit of a meme, the underlying technology is very much a real, practical, useful thing, and it&#39;s a huge world of which Bitcoin is only a tiny, and shrinking, part. So if Bitcoin is gaining its value from the &quot;Bitcoin = decentralization&quot; meme, that meme is going to go away sooner or later, as vastly more useful examples of decentralized tech come to the fore in the minds of the public with the rise of web3.</p>\n\n<p>So in short, I think decentralization is an extremely powerful meme whose real-world examples are hugely impactful, and Bitcoin has remained at the top by being the poster child for decentralized tech, but that will only last for so long.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-11-22 13:40:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hlouxcb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qzejcz","parent_id":"t1_hlosyqw","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Notios","body":"Sorry was driving home so couldn\u2019t reply\n\nI think ultimately we are in agreement; that it is an idea, meme or narrative that gives bitcoin its current value, and that it is temporary.
