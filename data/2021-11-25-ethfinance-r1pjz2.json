They haven't spent the initial 120mil. If you really plan to deliver the merge in the advertised timeframe (June 2022) then dumping another 90mil now made 0 sense.

It's the way all bitcoin aficionados talk about it. It's supposed to be a hedge against inflation. I find this partly debatable due to its lack of historical depth and poor performance compared to other SoVs during the covid crash, but let's validate this one out of generosity.\n* The best analogy for bitcoin to match gold's conductor use is probably its role as a payment system. But even though becoming [a peer to peer electronic cash system was at the core of bitcoin at its creation](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), as of today it has become a secondary characteristic. Bitcoin alone can't do it, at all. The only way it is used as a payment system is through the Lightning Network which [has very low usage](https://defipulse.com/) and is centralized to the core because of Blockstream's influence. [More info about that here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYn6EQDqTkU&).\n* For the jewelry part ([which happens to be gold's biggest use case for newly mined metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold)), I'm unable to find any reasonable analogy within bitcoin's rare use cases.

BUT it also has one strong advantage over it: deflation. As we all know eth might very well soon have a [3% yearly  deflation rate](https://ultrasound.money/), which not only gives it an advantage over bitcoin but also one over gold. In this category, eth will soon win.\n* As opposed to bitcoin, eth has technical utility in defi. It's not only used to pay for transactions, but you can do stuff with it natively: lend it, use it as collateral, swap it, .... the list is getting longer every day. In this category, eth wins.\n* For the jewelry part, ether does have at least one perfect analogy in its arsenal: NFTs. Given their explosion over the past year, it's safe to say the digital world was craving for what they allow: to be a digital collector, and to show off through PFPs.
