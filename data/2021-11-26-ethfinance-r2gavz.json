The simplest of them is if you didn't give the transaction enough gas, and it ran out. With smart contract calls, estimating gas usage can be tricky, and sometimes you (or rather, your wallet, which does the estimating) is wrong and doesn't put enough. If it runs out, the transaction will revert, and you will have lost your gas.\n\nMore complicatedly, smart contract calls can also revert themselves, for a variety of reasons. A good example of this would be a Uniswap call, where the transaction took too long to be accepted (because the gas price wasn't high enough for the current gas market, so it had to wait until basefee got lower). Uniswap swaps need to go through within a certain time frame, or else the smart contract will revert and the transaction will fail (the reasoning being that the market changed in the meantime). There are infinite other reasons a smart contract call might choose to revert. In all of those cases, you will lose your gas.\n\nA situation where you *won't* lose your gas is the case where you put your gas price so low, that the transaction never (in the timeframe you care about, anyway) goes through. In that case, it's not failed so much as stuck, and you haven't spent any gas yet. You can always unstick it by submitting a new transaction with the same nonce and a higher gas price.\n\nThe reason a failed/reverted transaction still costs gas is, because nodes still had to process your transaction in order to tell that it would fail. That processing takes real work, replicated across thousands of nodes. If those failed transactions didn't actually cost gas, it would be trivially easy to DDOS the blockchain by hitting it with millions of transactions designed to fail, but which take lots of processing to reveal that. Because it costs gas even if it fails, that would make a DDOS attack incredibly expensive.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Not a dumb question!</p>\n\n<p>Transactions fail for a variety of reasons.
