Block proposers are known in advance and can potentially be DDoSed. This is especially bad in the context of MEV where it can be rational to DDoS. For example, imagine there's a hot NFT launch starting at slot `s`. An attacker controlling the proposer at slot `s+1` may try to DDoS the proposer at slot `s` to be the first to access the NFT launch and \"steal\" the MEV from slot `s`.\n\nThe good news is that so-called Single Secret Leader Election (SSLE) where the identity of future proposers is not publicly known ahead of time is definitely possible. We're making significant progress with [specs for the most promising SSLE scheme](https://github.com/asn-d6/consensus-specs/blob/ssle_review_09122021/specs/phase0/notes-ssle-beacon-chain.md). The bad news is that the minimum-viable merge will not include SSLE and that Ethereum will be exposed to such DDoS (both purely malicious attacks as well as rational attacks in the context of MEV) for months.\n\nOne short-term saving grace is the dynamic block sizes of EIP-1559. Indeed, empty slots will reduce the base gas price and lead to compensating larger-than-target blocks. Because the EIP-1559 slack (gas limit divided by gas target) is 2x, the total Ethereum throughput will not be affected so long as less than 50% of slots are empty.

I think it should be higher but maybe that's just because I have learned so much here, thanks to all of you! I think I'd comment more frequently but I don't have enough karma. Honestly I don't want to sell my soul to farm moons on cc or on ethtrader or wherever it's a thing.\n\nOk, I confess I've had a couple of glasses scotch so I'm not sure what will come out of this.\n\nMaybe I'll start with some background. I first came to know about ethereum a few years ago, when the I heard about mining. I had a r9 290 and I was thinking about mining eth but it would've taken a few days to get one eth! (I admit I can't exactly recall how many days, but I'm pretty sure it was closer to days or weeks rather than months). I thought to my self: screw that I'm gonna mine some zclassic for better gains. Then came some zclassic btc fork called bitcoin private and the price of zclassic crashed down. At that point I lost interest and forgot about crypto.\n\nIn the fall of 2020 I entered back into the mining business with my newly bought rtx 3090. This time I chose ethereum and started to look into it more closely. I landed on ethtrader and lurked there until someone mentioned about this sub. It didn't take long until I left ethtrader behind and started to read the daily literally everyday.\n\nAgain I'm a bit fuzzy if this happened before I bought my first eth at coinbase. Most likely I did this before I found this sub as I was not using cb pro that was recommended here for the obvious reason above basic cb. Also I recall making some epic trades when I bought at 500\u20ac and sold at 750\u20ac or so making me more certain I found this sub later.\n\nAfter lurking here for a couple of months I started to try out DeFi with huge amounts of confidence. What I did was probably as wise as the trade mentioned above but still, I was putting into practice everything (sensible) I learned here. Also worth to mention that I didn't get rugged which is nice, even though I used some shady pools when polygon was new and shiny.\n\nI'm on mobile so I think it would be sensible to end this but maybe I'll go a little bit longer.\n\nJust like I longed eth after the may dip. My partner does not know this but I took a small loan from my bank during this time. (I know, pretty inresposible, but I saw the chance and took it. Also been working full time since then so it's not affecting our financial situation).\n\nAlso took a crypto loan to pay for a new (used) car as we were in desperate need for a wagon. I paid this off today and it was somewhat painful (compared to arbitrum for example) with many transactions on L1 even though gas is not that bad atm. \n\nWith that out of the way here comes the nft hype season. Oh wait, I'll have to thank you guys for the ens airdrop as I bought an ens name before that. Small regrets for only buying it for two years as it would've been pretty affordable to buy it for longer.\n\nSo now back to the nft train. Someone here mentioned artblocks, so I aped in (responsibly). First bought the one where the pegs dance around. Then a rinascita, pigments, and a couple of factory nfts. (sold them with profit to buy the next ones). Came out with 2-3eth profit I think. Could've been more, again, but it was still pretty significant for me.\n\nI have left out many alt coin adventures out of the story as I have realized that you just can't beat eth when it comes to risk/reward. Also dydx adventures with leverage were left out. You know how that ended up. (Ok gained some if you take into account the rewards but still, don't use leverage folks if you're not 100% sure about what you are doing). L2 adventures were left out as well but it's fun out there. Not as much to do as in L1 but the gas fees and speed are so nice). \n\nI would like to thank one ethfinancier (arcanesofantiquity or something like that) in particular for shilling an alt coin that has treated me well and I've been actively participating in the project's discord. I think this is one of the reasons why I haven't been too concerned about the recent lull we've had.\n\nThank you all.
