Bancor v3 is targeting the same niche. Curve is branching out beyond like-kind assets and will compete with Sushi for the incentivized liquidity game.\n\n2) Better Liquidity automation and management tools on top of Uniswap v3. XToken is going more heavily in that direction. We have Visor, Tokemak is coming online, Impermax is slowly gaining TVL.\n\n3) We'll see the rise of more liquidity direction right (LDR) tokens in the style of Curve, Pickle, etc. Scheduled regular votes that direct emissions. YFI seems to already be going there. I see no reason Impermax, XToken, Alchemix, etc won't follow. If you have emissions, granting governance control over those emissions adds value to the governance token. This will lead to escalated CRV wars. More bribe platforms like Convex, Votemak, and Badger. Someone might even generalize the concept (feel free to steal Concave finance).\n\n4) More tools for DAOs like Coordinape, Snapshot, and KPIs. Bonds will continue to gain traction. Liquidity Direction protocols like Tokemak will come online and slowly replace direct emissions to Pool-2's. Defi is going to revolutionize liquidity farming as you know it. There will be less free lunch for just parking your liquidity somewhere.\n\n5) More protocols will use staking funds as an insurance backstop for protocol failure. Some day we're going to see a more successful insurance model than Nexus Mutual, Umbrella, weird prediction markets, etc. In the short term though staking pools are the likely answer.\n\n6) We'll start to see more protocols directly incentivize voter participation. Eventually we'll see the rise of some type of standardized vote delegation system but it may not be this year. Also we'll eventually see some bonded voting mechanisms appear such as UMA KPIs but probably not in mass this year.\n\n7) Mass migrations of liquidity to Ethereum L2's. L2 Summer was a dud but this is still coming in a big way.\n\n8) Stable coin growth to $1T. Might not all be on Ethereum and the distribution will hopefully continue to shift away from Tether but we did more than 10x last year and its only like 6-7x to $1T. That will put stablecoins at about 1% of all fiat supply. The US can't ignore this.\n\n9) More 'badge' style NFTs such as POAPs that can only be unlocked based your history. These will become increasingly gamified and woven into more complex systems.\n\n10) Institutional staking. We saw Ether capital start staking. Maybe we'll see ETHE start staking.
