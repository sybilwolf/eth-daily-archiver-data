Maker needs to have DAI backed by collateral for the threat of emergency shutdown to mean something. Alchemix however only needs to be able to protect their peg. They could in theory allow you to take a loan at any collateralization ratio, even sub-100%, using any collateral they want without any threat of liquidation and as long as they can maintain the peg the system works.
