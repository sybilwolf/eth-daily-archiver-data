I\u2019ve been posting here, and in the past /r/ethtrader, off and on for the past \\~5 years. Some of you probably recognize my name, but I imagine many do not. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve contributed much meaningful content, but I hope to change that going forward.\n\nI have made a lot of changes in my life the past two years, or more accurately a lot of change was forced on me. At the start of 2020, right before the pandemic hit, my fianc\u00e9e walked out on me and the house we had **just** bought together. I had built my life around her, moved to a different state, worked a series of thankless jobs, it was all for her. Then one day, she came to me and said she didn\u2019t love me anymore and that she\u2019d always had doubts. She moved back in with her parents for a short time and I lived alone, trapped in our house as the pandemic hit. I dwelt in that pain for a long, long time. Initially, I thought I could win her back if I could just be better. In my mind I was clearly the one who fucked everything up. **She** was perfect, **I** was flawed. It took me a long time to realize that wasn\u2019t true. **For her** I started working out every day. **For her** I stopped smoking weed every day. Only one of those changes ended up sticking. After a month of separation, we met up and she confirmed that we were done. She didn\u2019t want to work on our issues at all, she\u2019d made up her own mind and with a snap of her fingers, she was gone. At this point, I said \u201cfuck it\u201d and started smoking weed again, as I had been for the past 10 years. Thankfully, I kept working out every day. Every time I got too angry, sad, or frustrated (which was a lot) I went down in the basement and worked out with the dumbbells I had bought years prior that had never gotten much use till then.\n\nLife moved ever forward. Work was stressful as my boss had just left directly after firing the only other person in our office, so there I was doing three people\u2019s jobs with no training for my boss\u2019 position. Covid caused a hiring freeze in the municipality that I worked, so I was stuck in that situation all year, alone with no help. At home, I still had to deal with the house by myself. One night it poured and the town\u2019s stormwater/sewer system backed up in the street and my basement began to flood with that nasty water. I remember crying down there, tears in my eyes as I desperately tried to block the line as literal shit bubbled up and spilled onto the floor. Eventually I stemmed the flow and began cleaning the basement with bleach. Surprise, surprise, after that I immediately caught Covid\u2026 Looking back now that was probably the worst time in my life so far. I was a wreck. I was beating myself up for smoking weed again, I was angry at the world for the hand I\u2019d been dealt, and I was angry at myself for letting what I thought was the only good thing in my wretched life slip away. My Mom was actually worried I\u2019d kill myself, she literally said this to me one night when I was venting on the phone. Thankfully, I never even contemplated it, I was actually angry that she even thought I\u2019d do that.\n\nLuckily, things do not stay bad forever. Summer came and a friend moved back from the other coast. He was looking for a place to live, so I jumped at the opportunity to have someone in my home. It lightened the load on the mortgage, but mainly I wasn\u2019t alone all the time anymore. Also importantly, I sought out a therapist to talk to and work with. The other great thing that happened was obviously the start of this crypto cycle. At the start of the pandemic I thought I was fucked financially. My crypto holding was at an all time low and I wrongly assumed the housing market was going to be fucked. Instead, as the year progressed, my house went up in value and my crypto portfolio went 10x. Celebrating here with you folk was one of my few reprieves. My job was still stressful, but I could get through each day because things were beginning to work in my favor in other aspects of my life. Early summer I also found a tab of LSD in my freezer that I had acquired years prior. One sunny day I popped it under my tongue and, honestly, I think it changed my life forever. I had a number of epiphanies that day, but the most important was that **everyone is doing the best they can**. My ex didn\u2019t mean to hurt me the way she had, she just didn\u2019t know how to communicate her unhappiness any other way. I\u2019d done the same with a friend years before when I couldn\u2019t handle his problems. The hurt that I carried began to melt that day. It\u2019s not like it just up and disappeared, but it didn\u2019t sting as bad.\n\nThe year went on and eventually I sold the house in the Fall. My ex and I split the profit as we\u2019d split the down payment and the mortgage payments (with a slight favoring towards me since I\u2019d agreed to cover the mortgage when she moved out). I quit my stressful job even though I hadn\u2019t made nearly enough in crypto to stop working. I just needed something different, and after more than 6 months of Covid lockdown (and admittedly a couple more tabs of LSD) I realized I didn\u2019t want to work my whole life and rely on the idea that I\u2019d be able to retire some day, or that I\u2019d even live to see 65. I wanted to enjoy my life while I was young, so I quit my job and hit the road with another friend who happened to be unemployed at the time. We drove across the United States and visited friends and a couple National Parks. I ended up taking another tab of LSD in Zion National Park and having an amazing time hiking the Narrows and camping under a full-moon. Not many epiphanies, but God it was fun. Winter was coming though and camping was becoming not-so-fun. We made it back home just after the election and I moved in with my parents for a short time. After about a month, I moved in with some friends in the local City and have been living here ever since. The rent is super cheap so I\u2019ve just been living off my house-sale profit and a little of my crypto-gains. Life should have been more relaxed, but I was still constantly on edge.\n\nThe problem was that I was not done growing, I was still stressed out and anxious and I was still smoking weed every single day, pretty much all day. I kept justifying it to myself, even though I experienced a high level of anxiety every time I got high. I was caught in the loop. Literally all of my friends at that point smoked weed too, so it was hard to convince myself that it was a real problem. I couldn't even enjoy my crypto-gains because I felt like I didn't deserve them. I felt like I couldn't talk to anyone outside this forum about it because I was scared people would judge me, that they too would think I didn't deserve it. It all just felt surreal. I actually briefly discussed this with /u/savage-dragon at one point. At this time I was no longer working with a therapist (as I\u2019d switched health insurance and moved states), so I sought out another. Where my last therapist had promoted meditation and mindfulness, this one has had me work hard to examine my life. He helped me identify that my problems come from my extreme self-consciousness. He helped me realize that I feel a huge burden of shame. The shame kept me locked inside myself, unable to move forward with my life, unable to forget the past. He helped me realize that smoking weed every single god damn day was a **huge** source of shame in my life. I couldn\u2019t control my habit, which made me feel like I couldn\u2019t control anything in my life and I was deeply embarrassed by this. My therapist helped me admit to myself something I've known for a long time: that I am addicted to marijuana, that I am powerless over my use of that substance, that my abuse of another substance (alcohol) was enabling my continuous use of marijuana. It\u2019s been a month since I stopped smoking and I feel more clear-minded than I\u2019ve been in a long, long time. I\u2019ve stopped smoking pot in the past for employment drug tests or when my ex left, but I never did it **for me**. I always stopped because something \\*else\\* demanded it, and so when the coast was clear I always started up again. This time feels different. This time I\u2019m doing this for me, because I know it will make my life better. There\u2019s a silly phrase that echoes in my head occasionally. It\u2019s kind of based on a Friday Night Lights quote (I think, I never actually watched the show): \u201cClear Mind, Full Heart, Can\u2019t Lose\u201d. That sounds corny as hell even just writing it out, but I\u2019m not going to be embarrassed about that because it\u2019s literally true. I think about that phrase often and it helps me get through each day.\n\n(continues because apparently this is longer than I thought)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Warning: long-ass personal post inspired by some others I\u2019ve seen talking about their lives.</p>\n\n<p>Hello all, I\u2019ve been considering making this post for a while now.

I started listening to podcasts last year and have invested even more time this year. To end the year Ill do two post, mostly for me to structure my thoughts, but of course also sharing this with you to receive feedback - in the end I just believe that I understand a lot, but I am also sure there is still so much to learn!\n\nThe first post will be about my learnings, not specifically this year, but my whole crypto journey. Ill also share some implications, even though these might evolve in the future withmore learnings.... The second post, hopefully tomorrow or so, will be about my predictions for the future.\n\nSo what did I learn along the way?\n\n1. **Don't invest in last cycles coins**  \nWhen I started in Jan 2018 I literally bought the top. Made my first deposit on a Friday, made +100$ on my 1 ETH overnight and boom. You know the story. I was exit liquidity. Not just for ETH, but for all the hype coins of last cycle. XLM, IOTA, ADA, NEO, etc. Now the problem is not that I bought them back then, the problem is that I doubled down during the bear market and most of them. And in terms of USD I am of course okay with most of my investments, but since I denominate in ETH I could have made way more.Now I don't believe that the headline is completely true. E.g. I think some \"first generation\" defi coins will make it (and they are \"last cycle\" if you will), but I guess that most of the L1s of this cycle won't perform as well. But I guess you get my point, usually investing in new protocols that were built during the bear is a way better (while also riskier) investment than sticking to the old coins that will most likely not make it.This was/ is my first cycle, so I am okay. I didn't go into casino shit coins, I just bought shilled coins and won't do it again. Right now I would rather go for something like this: probably invest 50/50 into ETH and new coins. If I had to make a decision now these were ETH ecosystem tokens that go for a modular approach, so execution layer tokens, but also DA tokens once they are out.\n2. **Understand the narrative**  \nI didn't really get \"defi summer\", which means I also not participated. I wasn't (really) early to NFTs even though on e.g. Bankless they were mentioned a lot. While I think it is really hard to understand what is really hot and what's just a trend that fades within days I have made the decision to try new stuff more even if that means sometimes spending money on that stuff that will be gone after a few days. And I to as explicit as possible: Executions layers give me strong NFT vibes. I think it is obvious that playing around with different solutions is a no brainer. E.g. I have used zksync for a deposit after months of not adding funds, have played around with Argent (and love it!), am using Arb1 and OE to invest into rETH etc. Execution layers will be huge and are starting to be the narrative. Can't wait for the \"real\" starknet launch, especially after listening to two podcasts with the StarkWare team (check out the Hasu episode. Mind. Blown.)\n3. **Don't try to (day) trade**  \nI am happy to say I am not a trader. After clearing my dydx airdrop I kept 120$ on it. Did some 5x bet on SOL at 38$ or so and hit the jackpot. 50x'ed my money in weeks. It was so easy. I didn't understand why 5x wasn't the new spot. I was sure I could make those 5k 50k until the end of the cycle. Just trade a little, always buy more. And it worked until it didn't. Funnily if I had not trade after opening the 5x I wouldn't have liquidated I think. But I added margin, did cross-margin, etc.Now don't get me wrong, this was maybe the most valuable experience I made in 2021. I lost it all and I deserved it. It was humbling. But for the first time I did understand how it all worked, technically, what could happen, why, etc.I won't day trade, but I might use dydx or similar protocols to go long in case the bear hits us at one point and I feel like we have bottomed. I understand the risks now, I understand the fees, I understand that I should probably use different wallets for different assets/longs to be not liquidated via cross margin etc. E.g. I could imagine going long on 3-4 different L2 tokens once they are listed.\n4. **You can't predict crypto short term**  \nThis topic is obviously connected to my trading fails, but also just watching the markets. I was sure that Q4 the rocket will take off, BTC will lead, profits will flow into alts, we will go parabolic latest in Q1, blow off top, good game. Everyone was convinced this would happen (disclaimer: when I say everyone, I am not talking about this sub, I talk mainly about crypto twitter, partly friends, this sub, etc.). But it didn't and it also would have been too easy. But a market like crypto is not easy, at least not short term. Is crypto/ ETH up only? I truly believe so. Does buying make sense if you wanna hold for 5 years. I truly believe so. Are we gonna hit 10k? I truly believe so. Is it gonna happen in Q1? I have no idea (anymore).Right now I would probably say: if crypto twitter is convinced that something is gonna happen it's most likely doing the opposite or at best not doing anything at all. Crypto moves too fast, is innovating with so much speed that it is really hard to predict stuff on the short term and maybe even harder if you've been through some cycles.\n5. **Finance is a different world**  \nThis is also one of my biggest learnings this year. At one point I said \"defi is cool, but there is no real world impact, people are borrowing money they don't need to buy more crypto stuff.\" While I think it's right that defi should have a real world impact, I was probably naive with that statement. Cause I guess that's also how \"real world\" finance works. People that have money don't put it in their savings account. Banks use money to make money. Collateral is collateral in another application. You buy a house to lend against it. To be honest: I am sure I haven't really understood this world completely. I don't even know if I wanna do that. But I will try to be less naive than before. E.g. I will move some funds from my bank account over to e.g. zksync, I won't buy ETH, but just leave it in stables and get my 5% APY.  I was hesitant to do this before because of all the risk involved but I feel like now is a good time to start using my wallet like my bank account.\n6. **Take profits**  \nI thought being born at the top of the bull market I could easily handle any downturn forward. Turns out higher computer numbers to have an impact on my mental health. The May crash showed me that I was not okay with another bear market. I have made a laddered approach to take profits, hopefully starting in the next months.I think this will help me in several ways. I will be much calmer, cause my initial investment is out then (hopefully). But even more important: if you have money on the sidelines any crash is not just worrying but also an opportunity. I never understood people that said \"please dip a little more\". I think I might be able then. I won't cheer for a bear. But Ill be able to handle it way better.\n\nThere is probably more, way more, but right now I can't think of more stuff and it's already a long post, so adding more will just make people skip it.\n\nThank you all for reading, thank you all for posting and for helping me learn so much in the past 12 months. This year has been an incredible ride, up, down, sideways.
