My question however becomes, if ethereum core protocol design becomes constrained by this, in a bid to avoid over-reliance on specialised block producers, what target market are they building for?

I personally wasn&#39;t comfortable deploying the wallet until I had a firm understanding of the processes involved, so I waited until the newest app update had some feedback that I could read about and learn from on Reddit.</p>\n\n<p>Loopring&#39;s Discord has some great resources (including an FAQ section and a playlist of &quot;how-to&quot; videos) and they post any major announcements there. I believe the dev team said the fiat off-ramp from L2 is coming sometime in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>But yeah, I think it would be hugely beneficial if they can find a way to simplify and streamline the UX after they&#39;ve gathered some feedback.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-28 23:18:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hqducun","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rr0uhq","parent_id":"t1_hqdt8zr","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Papazio","body":"Thanks for the info, _another_ Discord to hop in and try to keep up to date with.

It&#39;s very hard to keep buying and to keep throwing large amounts of money into an asset that just keeps dropping in half every couple of months, seemingly forever.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-29 19:00:24","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-12-29 19:05:37","id":"hqhxniy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rr0uhq","parent_id":"t1_hqhglsp","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/MorganZero","body":"Challenge accepted.\n\nRemind Me!

They're not making money by creating value. They are taking it, through negative sum games. They are taking it without discrimination, from the man who makes $200 a month and mistakingly sees gambling on leverage as his way out of poverty.\n\nTo make one SBF a billionaire, it takes many people, millions of people, to lose their shirt in the leverage casino. People who are already struggling on a daily basis; people who have neither ability nor opportunity. Centralized exchange billionaires are minted out of the desperation of the poorest of the poor.\n\nThis isn't just numbers on a screen. These are real people, living in places where support structures are nonexistent. Some of these people will lose it all. Some of these people take their own lives after said losses.\n\nEven if we buy the narrative at face value, if we accept the idea of gathering money for the sake of \"effective charities\". How many human sacrifices are acceptable in the pursuit of that goal? It might sound dramatic, but this is really what this boils down to.\n\nGovernments make these cost/benefit decisions all the time. But then, governments have some legitimacy in providing useful services we all need, even if we may not agree with their effectiveness or the price we pay for them. Governments have various levels of legitimacy in the way they're formed and elected, too.\n\nWhereas here, we're talking about one guy running a casino with no brakes and funneling the proceeds into his bank account. FTX brings so little positive value to the world you might have to pull out a microscope to see it. The steelman case for offshore leveraged centralized exchanges may be to classify them as \"entertainment\". However, it's difficult to believe the value of said entertainment matches the extraordinary human cost and destruction of capital.\n\nWhich leads to another question: is it conceivable someone *truly* concerned about improving the world would run an enterprise he knows ruins lives? \"The end justifies the means\" can only carry you so far. There are numerous ways to make a lot of money providing real value to the world. To ignore all those paths, and to instead pick more exploitative routes, implies certain things about a person.\n\nPerhaps they're incompetent. They couldn't hack it to the same level of success in competition with legit ventures, so they use illegitimate means.\n\nWhy trust an incompetent actor to suddenly be competent when it comes to deploying all that money for charity?\n\nOr perhaps their moral compass is broken. The suffering they cause doesn't register. They convince themselves they know better, that the sacrifice of a few, the damage they directly caused, is worth it for the many more they'll get to help.\n\nNothing like an unelected megalomaniac spearheading charity work.\n\nOr maybe, just maybe... They're full of shit, and all of this is part of their hustle.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In my opinion, there is a fundamental problem with SBF types.

Some of these people take their own lives after said losses.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we buy the narrative at face value, if we accept the idea of gathering money for the sake of &quot;effective charities&quot;. How many human sacrifices are acceptable in the pursuit of that goal? It might sound dramatic, but this is really what this boils down to.</p>\n\n<p>Governments make these cost/benefit decisions all the time. But then, governments have some legitimacy in providing useful services we all need, even if we may not agree with their effectiveness or the price we pay for them. Governments have various levels of legitimacy in the way they&#39;re formed and elected, too.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas here, we&#39;re talking about one guy running a casino with no brakes and funneling the proceeds into his bank account. FTX brings so little positive value to the world you might have to pull out a microscope to see it. The steelman case for offshore leveraged centralized exchanges may be to classify them as &quot;entertainment&quot;. However, it&#39;s difficult to believe the value of said entertainment matches the extraordinary human cost and destruction of capital.</p>\n\n<p>Which leads to another question: is it conceivable someone <em>truly</em> concerned about improving the world would run an enterprise he knows ruins lives? &quot;The end justifies the means&quot; can only carry you so far. There are numerous ways to make a lot of money providing real value to the world. To ignore all those paths, and to instead pick more exploitative routes, implies certain things about a person.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps they&#39;re incompetent. They couldn&#39;t hack it to the same level of success in competition with legit ventures, so they use illegitimate means.</p>\n\n<p>Why trust an incompetent actor to suddenly be competent when it comes to deploying all that money for charity?</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps their moral compass is broken. The suffering they cause doesn&#39;t register. They convince themselves they know better, that the sacrifice of a few, the damage they directly caused, is worth it for the many more they&#39;ll get to help.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing like an unelected megalomaniac spearheading charity work.</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe, just maybe... They&#39;re full of shit, and all of this is part of their hustle.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-29 05:18:48","distinguished":null,"edited":"2021-12-29 05:26:39","id":"hqen794","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rr0uhq","parent_id":"t1_hqdug4n","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"So you think it is immoral to provide leverage trading to people?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So you think it is immoral to provide leverage trading to people?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2021-12-29 08:23:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hqfb2bs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rr0uhq","parent_id":"t1_hqen794","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"Edit: everything in my bones tells me you're a troll, but maybe I do need to chill out in the event I'm wrong.

I first thought about leaving a price prediction out (and in the end I didn't really make one), but at least included a prediction regarding the market development. \n\nDisclaimer: I truly believe that it is very hard to make these predictions. This was made for fun and there are probably 100 people with 100 different opinions and just one will be (more or less) right. I think it is very likely my prediction is wrong, but still I want to share my thoughts how I came to this thesis/ prediction.\n\nOn top let me state that I truly believe in ETH and am a long term bull. I am not trading and will not sell 80%+ of my portfolio. I will take profits though, that I am most likely reinvesting if we see a crash and bear market. If ETH is up only then I am more than okay with that too, then the profits will either go into riskier investments or I'll use this money as part of the down payment for the house we wanna buy. \n\nSo why do I think the merge will be or lead to a top that will be followed by a 12 month bear market? \n\nLet's start with some assumptions and numbers. I didn't add price predictions yesterday, so maybe people couldn't understand my thoughts, so adding some targets might help. \n\nAssumption 1: Merge in May 2022\n\nAssumption 2: ETH between 8.000 and 10.000 USD in May 2022\n\nThis implies we will see a pump in 2022 that more or less doubles ETH compared to today. I expect that a date for the merge could make this happen aka meme the bull market back and stops the sideways action. But even with a date there are some people saying that institutional investors took profits in 2021 and will re-enter the market in 2022, because that's just there modus operandi. Both arguments combined make 10k ETH seem achievable. \n\nNow if (!) that happens, I don't think that 10k will be the top. I could actually see a 10k merge, sell the news event where ETH drops to 8k-ish. The sell pressure drop won't be instant. So a bear trap is imo possible. This could lead to a gradual effect in the supply that let's ETH pass 10k once more and lead to a blow off top with heavy volatility in between that resembles BTCs blow off top in 2017. I don't expect it to top at 19k just like BTC, I think it has to be different, so let's take an optimistic approach and say ETH makes it close to 25-30k (maybe something like 10k --> 8k --> 19k --> 15k --> 27k blow off top). \n\nNow a blow off top doesn't necessarily mean a bear market is inevitable. But the crazier the top, the more likely the market needs to cool down. And when I say market, I mean market - not ETH. Let's just assume that BTC passes 200k (4x from here). Let's assume that coins like SOL pass 1k+ (5x from here). Or AVAX passes 500$+ (5x from here). This would put BTC close to 5T (more like 4T) mcap, SOL to 250B mcap, AVAX to 125B mcap. This even assumes these hyped L1s won't perform as good as ETH does. Just for reference: ETH had a mcap of 135B at the top of Jan 2018. So L1s with some/decent usage would be valued higher than Ethereum at the top os 2018 when there was no competition. SOL would be almost twice as high wrt mcap. And then we are not talking about XRP, ADA, DOGE etc. \"Worst case\" is that they will outperform ETH and reach mcaps that are even higher, because of FOMO, hype, etc. So the market will be hot, too hot... And if that happens I sadly can't see ETH disconnecting completely from these coins. Doesn't matter if there is a supply shock. \n\nI also understand that institutional money has arrived. I am sure that changes the market. I am not sure if thats for better. Crypto is unregulated. Institutions are professionals. They make money on the way up and on the way down. And it's easier in crypto cause no laws are stopping them from manipulating the market if necessary. I don't think institutions = long term investment necessarily. There might be some funds that work that way. I am sure there are at least as many that will trade as short term as possible to make the biggest profits. \n\nNow why a 75-80% correction? First of all cause SOL/AVAX etc. need to correct by 90%. But one thing that's even more important for me: We had a 60%+ correction this May without a blow off top. ETH had a great run, don't get me wrong, this was close to euphoria, but it was no blow off top, it's not even close. So if we have a blow off top we that maybe takes us from 15k to almost 30k = 100% within hours/ days --> I could expect/ see a 50% correction from the take off price and 50% \\* 50% = 75%. Add another 5% cause crypto surprises you on the upside but also on the downside --> 80%. \n\nHow? Some regulatory FUD from the states at some point. China banning crypto for the next time. A huge exchange under pressure. I don't care. In the worst case scenario the crypto hype dies, there is no new money, usage goes down and mainly happens on execution layers. This results in low gas and despite the low issuance via PoS ETH is not deflationary because we see single digit gas or 15 gas or some days. If that happens --> bye bye. \n\nBut just to clarify again: even if that happens that doesn't mean we will be revisiting the old ATH aka 1,4k. If we reached 20k that would be a 4-5k bear market bottom or 30k top --> 6-7.5k bear market bottom. I don't think we will go from 10k to 1.4-2k. These potential targets are also higher than the last BTC market values (19k --> 3.2 or 3.3k) and way better than ETHs performance in the last bear market (close to 95% crash). And just to make this as clear as possible: if ETH stopped at 80% that saves us another 75% crash compared to last bear market. So that really is a huge difference. \n\nAgain: This is most likely wrong / off. I am not a bear. I just don't see a supercycle, and less if there is real euphoria and a blow off top. I don't want this to happen. But I want to be (mentally) prepared for it. If it doesn't happen I am happy. If this helps some of you to see a different perspective, then this post already achieved a goal.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I made <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rq8gc2/daily_general_discussion_december_28_2021/hq9mjkh/\">this post</a> with predictions for 2022 yesterday. I first thought about leaving a price prediction out (and in the end I didn&#39;t really make one), but at least included a prediction regarding the market development. </p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I truly believe that it is very hard to make these predictions. This was made for fun and there are probably 100 people with 100 different opinions and just one will be (more or less) right. I think it is very likely my prediction is wrong, but still I want to share my thoughts how I came to this thesis/ prediction.</p>\n\n<p>On top let me state that I truly believe in ETH and am a long term bull. I am not trading and will not sell 80%+ of my portfolio. I will take profits though, that I am most likely reinvesting if we see a crash and bear market. If ETH is up only then I am more than okay with that too, then the profits will either go into riskier investments or I&#39;ll use this money as part of the down payment for the house we wanna buy. </p>\n\n<p>So why do I think the merge will be or lead to a top that will be followed by a 12 month bear market? </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with some assumptions and numbers. I didn&#39;t add price predictions yesterday, so maybe people couldn&#39;t understand my thoughts, so adding some targets might help. </p>\n\n<p>Assumption 1: Merge in May 2022</p>\n\n<p>Assumption 2: ETH between 8.000 and 10.000 USD in May 2022</p>\n\n<p>This implies we will see a pump in 2022 that more or less doubles ETH compared to today. I expect that a date for the merge could make this happen aka meme the bull market back and stops the sideways action. But even with a date there are some people saying that institutional investors took profits in 2021 and will re-enter the market in 2022, because that&#39;s just there modus operandi. Both arguments combined make 10k ETH seem achievable. </p>\n\n<p>Now if (!) that happens, I don&#39;t think that 10k will be the top. I could actually see a 10k merge, sell the news event where ETH drops to 8k-ish. The sell pressure drop won&#39;t be instant. So a bear trap is imo possible. This could lead to a gradual effect in the supply that let&#39;s ETH pass 10k once more and lead to a blow off top with heavy volatility in between that resembles BTCs blow off top in 2017. I don&#39;t expect it to top at 19k just like BTC, I think it has to be different, so let&#39;s take an optimistic approach and say ETH makes it close to 25-30k (maybe something like 10k --&gt; 8k --&gt; 19k --&gt; 15k --&gt; 27k blow off top). </p>\n\n<p>Now a blow off top doesn&#39;t necessarily mean a bear market is inevitable. But the crazier the top, the more likely the market needs to cool down. And when I say market, I mean market - not ETH. Let&#39;s just assume that BTC passes 200k (4x from here). Let&#39;s assume that coins like SOL pass 1k+ (5x from here). Or AVAX passes 500$+ (5x from here). This would put BTC close to 5T (more like 4T) mcap, SOL to 250B mcap, AVAX to 125B mcap. This even assumes these hyped L1s won&#39;t perform as good as ETH does. Just for reference: ETH had a mcap of 135B at the top of Jan 2018. So L1s with some/decent usage would be valued higher than Ethereum at the top os 2018 when there was no competition. SOL would be almost twice as high wrt mcap. And then we are not talking about XRP, ADA, DOGE etc. &quot;Worst case&quot; is that they will outperform ETH and reach mcaps that are even higher, because of FOMO, hype, etc. So the market will be hot, too hot... And if that happens I sadly can&#39;t see ETH disconnecting completely from these coins. Doesn&#39;t matter if there is a supply shock. </p>\n\n<p>I also understand that institutional money has arrived. I am sure that changes the market. I am not sure if thats for better. Crypto is unregulated. Institutions are professionals. They make money on the way up and on the way down. And it&#39;s easier in crypto cause no laws are stopping them from manipulating the market if necessary. I don&#39;t think institutions = long term investment necessarily. There might be some funds that work that way. I am sure there are at least as many that will trade as short term as possible to make the biggest profits. </p>\n\n<p>Now why a 75-80% correction? First of all cause SOL/AVAX etc. need to correct by 90%. But one thing that&#39;s even more important for me: We had a 60%+ correction this May without a blow off top.
