It is vitally important that you understand what you are legally permitted to attack, and to ensure the effects of your actions will not impact other systems. And by connecting to these online resources, you may be exposing yourself to attacks by other users of these systems. You are responsible for your own safety.\n\nWindows can absolutely not be ignored when learning security. However, to start out I recommend learning the basics of Linux.\nhttps://linuxjourney.com is a great resource for that.\n\nTo follow along with linuxjourney, download your linux distro of choice, and install it in vmware player free edition. \n\nTo go more in-depth with linux, check out https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/, just be careful and follow the rules.\n\nOnce you have a feel for Linux, lets move onto security.\nThe offensive and defensive sides of security are so intertwined, neither can be ignored. The following are free (some with paid tiers), interactive ways to learn many different aspects of infosec.\n\nhttps://overthewire.org/wargames/ - Many collections of challenges, each with a different focus\n\nhttps://microcorruption.com/login - an in-browser embedded device exploitation capture the flag\n\nhttps://www.vulnhub.com/ - lots of community made, intentionally vulnerable linux instances. You download the .iso, and load it into vmware player. Follow all precautions listed on the website. A lot of these are not super realistic, so dont get frustrated if you cant figure something out. Just search for a walkthrough online, and do your best to learn from it\n\nhttps://linuxleo.com - an extensive guide to using linux in the art of disk-based forensics. Strongly recommended\n\nhttps://blueteamlabs.online - They offer downloadable challenges of all sorts. Their main offering is their 'Investigations', scenarios in which you are responsible for cleaning up or investigating a security mess. These are completed in-browser, and 2 investigations are available for free. The value provided by the paid tier is well worth it IMO. They also have 2 accompanying courses+certificates at https://securityblue.team/\n\nhttps://root-me.org - an incredible, French heavy website. Again, tons of free challenges greatly ranging in difficulty and variety.\n\nhttps://www.hackthebox.com - As they bill themselves, 'A Massive Hacking Playground' is the only way to describe hackthebox. Again, tons of free downloadable challenges.\n\nThis is by far the largest, most active resource listed. When you pass the test to sign up(do they even still have that?), you are provided an openvpn profile. This will provide you access to the 20 most recently released 'boxes', machines that you attack. Much like vulnhub, some are not so realistic, we call those challenges 'ctf-y'.\n\nThe paid tier gives you access to some other premium networks they offer(most of which are MUCH more realistic). But perhaps more importantly, you gain access to every 'retired' box. I think over 200 boxes at this pont. Be careful, as you will be attacking hosts across the internet, also potentally opening your computer to attacks by other users.\n\nTriple check ip addresses every time you take any action, and KEEP YOUR SHIT UPDATED!\n\nI know there is so much missing, and would love criticism or additions.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Mods, please consider allowing this relatively off-topic comment to stay.

The Polygon team acted well, fixed the vulnerability and rewarded the white hats. But the fact that the vulnerability existed in the first place is outrageous because it is such an amateur mistake!\n\nSimply put: the MATIC token on Polygon is a [contract which implements ERC20 (called \"MRC20\")](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010/tokens), unlike the ETH token in Ethereum (which also makes me wonder why WMATIC is needed at all).\n\nA contract implementing ERC20 doesn't mean it has to stop at that, it can also go one step further and add more convenience functions. In this case, the MRC20 contract implemented a `transferWithSig` function which allowed gasless MATIC transfers (gas is paid by the recipient). Neat! Not only MATIC is an ERC20, it also has additional features!\n\nHowever, this new feature didn't check for balances which means that you could transfer (actually mint) as many tokens as you wanted from an address that signs you a transfer message. If I sign you an authorization allowing you to take from me 1 MATIC, not only you could take ALL my MATIC, **you could also mint unlimited MATIC that I don't have**!\n\nBut not only that, since the zero-address isn't checked, you don't even need a valid signed message!\n\nThis is such a basic mistake that I can't believe it wasn't caught before deploying in the first place! Any decent Solidity tutorial will tell you about the extreme importance of exhaustive testing and it's beyond me how the unit test suite missed the cases \"invalid signature\", \"transfer with more than authorized\" and \"transfer with more the sender has\" test cases for the `transferWithSig` function.\n\nThis is something I'd expect from a random BSC knock-off, not the Polygon mainnet.

Not only MATIC is an ERC20, it also has additional features!</p>\n\n<p>However, this new feature didn&#39;t check for balances which means that you could transfer (actually mint) as many tokens as you wanted from an address that signs you a transfer message. If I sign you an authorization allowing you to take from me 1 MATIC, not only you could take ALL my MATIC, <strong>you could also mint unlimited MATIC that I don&#39;t have</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>But not only that, since the zero-address isn&#39;t checked, you don&#39;t even need a valid signed message!</p>\n\n<p>This is such a basic mistake that I can&#39;t believe it wasn&#39;t caught before deploying in the first place! Any decent Solidity tutorial will tell you about the extreme importance of exhaustive testing and it&#39;s beyond me how the unit test suite missed the cases &quot;invalid signature&quot;, &quot;transfer with more than authorized&quot; and &quot;transfer with more the sender has&quot; test cases for the <code>transferWithSig</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>This is something I&#39;d expect from a random BSC knock-off, not the Polygon mainnet. It&#39;s really shameful. I don&#39;t understand how this went unnoticed for so long. Anyway, props to them for fixing the issue and awarding bounties.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-01 06:00:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hqt0mtt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rtcxl9","parent_id":"t3_rtcxl9","score":66,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pegcity","body":"this is an important reason to trust no side chain, I like polygon, but not with my keys","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>this is an important reason to trust no side chain, I like polygon, but not with my keys</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-01 06:03:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hqt0whb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rtcxl9","parent_id":"t1_hqt0mtt","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/newtosh","body":"Wow, thanks for explaining.

In other words it doesn't actually matter if something is environmentally friendly, it only matters whether people can make up some sort of mental justification that their environmentally unfriendly habits are not actually that bad.\n\nSee all the people in developed nations still upgrading their iPhones every year, burning through disposable plastic products, buying new clothes all the time, eating massive amounts of meat, driving everywhere, and taking flights as evidence of that. But hey, they separate their trash from their recycling, right? In their mind that makes them environmentally conscious, so they can live with a clean conscience. Don't pay attention to how [half of what they're putting in their recycling bin isn't even recyclable anyways](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled).

Statistically, it takes some number of CPU/GPU/ASIC cycles, increasing with the leading zeroes, to find such a thing. This acts, on average, as a rough \"proof\" that you've burned some amount of electricity, expended some resource, to produce the block. Since nobody else can be expected to accept the block of it's incorrect, this expenditure goes unreimbursed, let alone rewarded, if you produce an incorrect block. I.e., it functions as a penalty, discouraging misbehavior and making it unsustainable.\n\nProof of Stake involves making that mechanism more abstract.
