It's pretty decisive on a fairly wide range, 45k - 49k, but somewhat indecisive on where inside the range it wants to be.

I find this important as we newly track these trends. Because it really can help you breathe when you realize that more likely than not, the dumps and rockets are temporary until they establish new structure, new trend.\n\nAlso on the weekly is what would be considered a very bullish put/call skew of 0.35 in any other market. That would suggest a close on Friday a good bit above 48k but not surpassing the 50k wall without help.

We would've been riding sky high on some kind of ratio rocket to do that. but, we didn't. Currently, I'm planning to watch BTC options and the ETHBTC ratio separately to discern targets. [That said, today so far looks a little more accurate.](https://nimb.ws/TP6BIo) Max pain is 3700, skew is 0.29, and the first wall of calls is really 3800. (A call wall has already been surpassed at 3650, leaving those in the money or paying them out. If ETH options were as powerful as BTC, this would suggest ETH would be testing closer to 3650 by day's end. Let's hope not.)\n\nOn the ETHBTC ratio, we continue to work on our massive year-long bull breakout. We retested May/August high of 0.78 last week and recapturing 0.081 would be a nice confirmation of that test. 0.0845 holds all the keys as the last major resistance before 0.1. Generally, momentum is quite positive.

A bounce in dominance can come from one of two things: a BTC rally that drags us up at a slower pace or a BTC dump and we all die with it, just faster.
