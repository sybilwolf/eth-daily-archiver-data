An early critique about Bitcoin (when the grand vision for it was something similar to what we consider Ethereum/web3 today), was that decentralized structures tended towards centralization.\n\n\nContemporary ideas for Ethereum even take this into consideration with Proposer/Builder Separation, State Size, etc.\n\nAnd that's only for the underlying Blockchain itself. If the most decentralized aspect of the system needs to work against natural centralization, what about the applications built on top? \n\n\nThere are probably solutions that address these issues but will they be able to outcompete centralized platforms in the long term?\n\nAgain, it's a really great read.

I have been hesitant to really do much on L1 lately, I had some ancient positions kind of sitting around, but actually doing the math on gas vs. return made me more confident in putting my ETH into some better vehicles. I hope this sheet helps you do the same, if you are in my position. \n\nThis sheet uses the cvxETH pool as an example, which currently has a 65% vAPR (!). Even with \"only\" 5 ETH, and gas >130 gwei, for example, you can still make the equivalent of .27 ETH per month (~$850 at current price), not including initial deposit cost. (You can change any of the numbers to whatever you want, just make a copy.) Obviously if gas gets insane, your return goes down; this sheet can help you figure that out, as well as optimal compounding periods over longer timeframes. \n\nFor reference, the crvcvx pool has maintained >50% vAPR for [over 3 months](https://llama.airforce/#/convex/pools/aleth) since last year. This is not some fly by night rugpull pool. (Read up on the \"Curve wars\" if you are unfamiliar with Convex...) It likely won't last, nothing this good does, but it could last for a few months at least and you might as well get it while you can. If and when it does go down to lower levels you will have likely made a very decent return, more than enough to cover even expensive gas costs going in and out.\n\nStacking ETH like this can help you forget the charts exist for a little bit. :) You can minimize exposure to CRV and CVX (if you want) by selling or compounding your earnings, which the sheet also includes calculations for. (Obviously DYOR and there's always inherent contract risks bla bla bla. But Convex and Curve are pretty solid as far as DeFi goes.)\n\nEnjoy!

Even with &quot;only&quot; 5 ETH, and gas &gt;130 gwei, for example, you can still make the equivalent of .27 ETH per month (~$850 at current price), not including initial deposit cost. (You can change any of the numbers to whatever you want, just make a copy.) Obviously if gas gets insane, your return goes down; this sheet can help you figure that out, as well as optimal compounding periods over longer timeframes. </p>\n\n<p>For reference, the crvcvx pool has maintained &gt;50% vAPR for <a href=\"https://llama.airforce/#/convex/pools/aleth\">over 3 months</a> since last year. This is not some fly by night rugpull pool. (Read up on the &quot;Curve wars&quot; if you are unfamiliar with Convex...) It likely won&#39;t last, nothing this good does, but it could last for a few months at least and you might as well get it while you can. If and when it does go down to lower levels you will have likely made a very decent return, more than enough to cover even expensive gas costs going in and out.</p>\n\n<p>Stacking ETH like this can help you forget the charts exist for a little bit. :) You can minimize exposure to CRV and CVX (if you want) by selling or compounding your earnings, which the sheet also includes calculations for. (Obviously DYOR and there&#39;s always inherent contract risks bla bla bla. But Convex and Curve are pretty solid as far as DeFi goes.)</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy! And please let me know if I screwed anything up in the chart.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-08 20:59:04","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-01-08 21:03:47","id":"hrvju7s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_rysxpo","parent_id":"t3_rysxpo","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/4thPillar","body":"Thanks buddy!
