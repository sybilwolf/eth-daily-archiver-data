There are numbers in the blockchain that say I have 2 ETH and you have 1 ETH. When I want to send you my 2 ETH, nodes process my transaction by subtracting 2 ETH from my account and adding 2 ETH to yours. So the numbers stored on the blockchain change from 2->0 and 1->3.\n\nUTXO stands for Unspent Transaction (TX) Output, and as you said, it is used by BTC and ADA. In this model, there aren't really \"accounts\" in the same way. Each transaction has to point to one or more previous transactions as a source of the funds (inputs), and creates one or more outputs saying where those funds are going. So if someone sent me 2 BTC and I wanted to pass that on to you, I don't point to my account balance as proof, I point to the output of a transaction that gave me funds. By adding up all of the *unspent* transaction outputs to your address, you can compute your current balance.\n\nThis has some interesting properties. First, BTC transactions almost always specify a *change address*. If I have a UTXO worth 3 BTC but I only want to send you 2 BTC, I have to create a tx with two outputs: one to send you 2 BTC and one to send myself the \"change\" of 1 BTC. UTXO's can't be partially spent, they can only be used once. (This is what the post above you was saying: change isn't really transaction volume)\n\nThis leads us to the second property, which is state management. In BTC, once a transaction's outputs are all spent, light clients don't need to know about it. It's nice for historical reference to be able to verify the source of the BTC all the way back to when they were first mined, but most nodes/services don't need to know that. If you want to know the current state of how much BTC everyone has now, you can fully derive that from the set of current UTXOs.\n\nI believe that property is what Cardano is after in mimicking a UTXO model. State expiry in Ethereum is much more complicated than that. However, as we've seen, the UTXO model doesn't play well with smart contacts. Just take a minute and think about what it even means. What previous transactions would you point to as input to a Uniswap trade? To a DAO vote?\n\nADA's solution (from my understanding, and I could be wrong) is that the entire state of the smart contract is passed in as the input, and then is \"spent\" to produce a modified state as output. But that means that in any given block, only one transaction can spend the current state of a smart contract. The next transaction has to wait until the previous transaction is included in a block so that it can spend its output, and so on. So the big challenge that sundaeswap is attempting to solve is to bundle multiple trades into one actual transaction in order to achieve any throughput at all.\n\nSo uh I'm going to stop writing now because that was more than I meant to get into but I think that covers not just what UTXOs are but why they might or might not be useful.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s easier to start with what Ethereum and ERC-20s do, which is account-based.
