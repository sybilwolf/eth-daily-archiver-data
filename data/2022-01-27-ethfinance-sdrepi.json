What does that mean? It means that to me, **trust is a dirty word**. \n\nSo many people think that trust is a great thing - it means you are safe to grant special privileges and permissions to anybody you think is trustworthy, right? \n\nWrong. It means you have *willingly given someone else the opportunity to abuse that privilege.* Sometimes that person will not abuse the privilege you have given them. And sometimes, you are wrong about them, and they will abuse it, and you will get hurt. Abusing trust is part of human nature, whether we like it or not. Trust is a bug. It's an exploit, a cheat code that people can, and therefore will, take advantage of.\n\nI know that this probably seems like an incredibly grim and dystopian take on the world. However, flip it around. Rather than concluding that humans will always abuse trust and that therefore the world is always going to suck, you can instead realize that **a trustless world is one where no special privilege exists to be abused**.\n\nThis is the foundational realization of decentralization and all those things built upon it (including crypto and web3). These concepts eliminate trust from many places where it has been necessary, and hence exploitable, until now. Centralization is fundamentally a trust relationship, gone into a negative feedback loop until it becomes both toxic and powerfully difficult to fight. Until now, we haven't had a better way to solve coordination problems, but we are currently standing on the brink of a whole new world that is no longer founded on trust, and hence mass advantage-taking of the trusting.\n\n------------------\n\nWhat does this all have to do with Wonderland and MIM/SPELL and con men running some of the largest DeFi projects out there?\n\nEasy: (some of) you trusted them. They built a \"DeFi\" empire where the treasury was under their control. It was exploitable. And at least one of them in a position to do so has now exploited it.\n\n*\"But almost all DeFi is like that,\"* I can hear you exclaiming. *\"We've got to trust the devs! What if something goes wrong? How do they upgrade?\"*\n\nNope. Look at UniSwap. The contracts are *immutable*. If something goes wrong with them, it's game over for everyone using them. But they are battle tested, and bugs are incredibly unlikely at this point. When the UniSwap team wants to upgrade, they *make a new version of the contracts*. Then they must *convince the community to start using that new version.* \n\nThis is how you build a DeFi primitive. You take trust out of the equation mercilessly, uncompromisingly. Trust is the killer, and it is so deadly because *everyone wants to trust others.* But if nobody controls what is happening except the code, and if the community of users has vetted and battle-tested that code, then suddenly you have a money lego worthy of the name \"DeFi\". \n\n-----------------\n\nI strongly believe that until we have a solid ecosystem of *immutable*, battle-tested DeFi primitives deployed across L1 and L2, and until the large majority of value on-chain is transacted via those tried and true and *trustless* primitives, DeFi isn't ready for prime time.\n\nWe're in the experimentation and messing around phase right now, and all of us participating in it are rightly calling ourselves \"degens\", because the risks of massive breaches of trust, like we saw today, are legion. That's all well and good - every protocol has to be new at one point, and training wheel phases are sometimes the fastest road to iterative development. Fortune favors the bold.\n\nBut we **must** hold our developers to the extremely high standard of immutable contracts (not even multisigs are good enough) once they have ironed out the kinks in their protocols, and before we truly consider their projects worthy of being enshrined in the halls of truly Decentralized Finance.\n\nI hope that we, as some of the core participants in crypto culture, can help steer the ship in that direction. Because I, for one, am super tired of the narrative around crypto being that it's all a big scam. I'm tired of it not because it's a lie, but because it's *almost true*. And as long as we *allow* trust to infiltrate our projects, our protocols, our *worldview of what is acceptable on Ethereum and web3*, we will be creating yet more opportunities for those scams and scammers to flourish. We ultimately only have ourselves to blame for trusting them.\n\nDon't trust! As of the past few years, we finally have the capacity to do better. *Please* don't trust! These next few years, we are either going to realize that trust is a dirty word, and truly move into the post-centralization era, or we are going to continue being incredibly fertile ground for the cons, scams, and ponzis that we have already built quite the reputation for.\n\nHumans, as a whole, do not deserve to be trusted.

It works as follows.</p>\n\n<p>When you enable \u2018Recovery with iCloud / Google Drive\u2019, the Argent app generates a random \u201ckey-encryption-key\u201d (KEK) that is unique to you. (A KEK is a cryptographic key that is used for the encryption or decryption of other keys).</p>\n\n<p>Your KEK will encrypt your private keys (plural because it applies to both Layer 1 and Layer 2 private keys, even if you only have one type of wallet). </p>\n\n<p>The encrypted private keys are then stored in your iCloud / Google Drive under your control. Your KEK, meanwhile, is sent to Argent (meaning the company\u2019s infrastructure, not the app). </p>\n\n<p>This split gives you added protection. If anyone gets access to your iCloud or Google Drive, they can\u2019t decrypt your keys without the KEK that Argent has. And if a malicious actor gets access to our infrastructure, they won\u2019t be able to access your wallet as they won\u2019t have your encrypted private keys.</p>\n\n<p>Recovering needs a two factor auth and a 48h waiting period.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-01-27 08:20:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hugeaxg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sdrepi","parent_id":"t1_hugbq5f","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Maswasnos","body":"I think Argent splits your key between their own guardian service and your Google Drive.
