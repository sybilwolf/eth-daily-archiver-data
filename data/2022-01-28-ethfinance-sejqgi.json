So I don't think I'm particularly unique but I have the context of each side. I've 100% truly and honestly been struggling to find the benefits NFTs bring to gaming for a while now. \n\nSo I do believe that there that quote gets one thing right - the level of player backlash is likely born out of ignorance to what NFTs can do. I'm sure the view is one of \"this is just another chance for Triple A studios to push the latest fad in our face to shovel \"\"micro\"\"transactions down our throats\". The destroying of the planet is short sighted, but not irrational given Ethereum is still a PoW chain at the moment (in terms of the chain running the NFTs). And frankly I'm not one to pretend that crypto at this stage is still largely a speculative space. I doubt all but a handful of people in this sub would be as interested as they are in the space if we weren't making life changing money. We are starting to leave that \"era\" but it's still prevalent, especially once you leave the Ethereum bubble. \n\nWith that out of the way, the skeptic in me is seeing the following. Which combined together just isn't painting an appealing picture. \n\n* This whole marketplace the Ubi exec talks about can exist without NFTs. And his quote on it made my eyes roll - if you think it's so great for the consumer why haven't you made it yet? I think these companies know they make the big money by tying one skin to one account. So if friend A is bored of it but friend B wants the skin, can't be traded. Friend B needs to buy it themselves. I'm skeptical to think these NFT rollouts are going to be anything but \"we only accept skins traded on our trading platform\". Where they put up a walled garden and charge a royalty on each sale... (but we'll see I guess, the trends of digital only goods, lack of couch co-op, lack of ultimate teams transfering year to year in sports games, and XBox's failed attempt to squash gifting games way back when are indicators to me the publishers want to take the walled garden approach.)\n* Items transferring across games isn't a new thing. It's happened sparingly in the past (NCAA football create a player to then be drafted into Madden comes to mind. Or bioware carrying over Shepard over the Mass effect trilogy). What we have seen is that game devs don't really want to do this, especially across different publishers. In fact there is financial incentive for them not to do this.

So I don&#39;t think I&#39;m particularly unique but I have the context of each side. I&#39;ve 100% truly and honestly been struggling to find the benefits NFTs bring to gaming for a while now. </p>\n\n<p>So I do believe that there that quote gets one thing right - the level of player backlash is likely born out of ignorance to what NFTs can do. I&#39;m sure the view is one of &quot;this is just another chance for Triple A studios to push the latest fad in our face to shovel &quot;&quot;micro&quot;&quot;transactions down our throats&quot;. The destroying of the planet is short sighted, but not irrational given Ethereum is still a PoW chain at the moment (in terms of the chain running the NFTs). And frankly I&#39;m not one to pretend that crypto at this stage is still largely a speculative space. I doubt all but a handful of people in this sub would be as interested as they are in the space if we weren&#39;t making life changing money. We are starting to leave that &quot;era&quot; but it&#39;s still prevalent, especially once you leave the Ethereum bubble. </p>\n\n<p>With that out of the way, the skeptic in me is seeing the following. Which combined together just isn&#39;t painting an appealing picture. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This whole marketplace the Ubi exec talks about can exist without NFTs. And his quote on it made my eyes roll - if you think it&#39;s so great for the consumer why haven&#39;t you made it yet? I think these companies know they make the big money by tying one skin to one account. So if friend A is bored of it but friend B wants the skin, can&#39;t be traded. Friend B needs to buy it themselves. I&#39;m skeptical to think these NFT rollouts are going to be anything but &quot;we only accept skins traded on our trading platform&quot;. Where they put up a walled garden and charge a royalty on each sale... (but we&#39;ll see I guess, the trends of digital only goods, lack of couch co-op, lack of ultimate teams transfering year to year in sports games, and XBox&#39;s failed attempt to squash gifting games way back when are indicators to me the publishers want to take the walled garden approach.)</li>\n<li>Items transferring across games isn&#39;t a new thing. It&#39;s happened sparingly in the past (NCAA football create a player to then be drafted into Madden comes to mind. Or bioware carrying over Shepard over the Mass effect trilogy). What we have seen is that game devs don&#39;t really want to do this, especially across different publishers. In fact there is financial incentive for them not to do this. Madden / FIFA / NBA 2k ultimate team cards could very easily build into the next years release.

If you have a pharmaceutical drug that you've generated data with and you want to prove to a potentially adversarial entity (e.g. a big pharma company on an M&A search, an investor holding discussions with competitors or with a competitive portfolio company, a frenemy development partner whose data security practices you don't trust) that you've generated data for a drug without disclosing its structure, zero-knowledge proofs would be phenomenal.   \n\n\nThe same is true for patenting - if you take a look at some biopharmaceutical patents out there (like [this one](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170290914A1/en) \\- ultimately rejected/abandoned, but indicative of the typical patenting approach), they take an obfuscation-based approach to patenting, including hundreds of possible sequences or structures, such that they disclose enough information about their drug to narrow the search space by many orders of magnitude, but don't disclose enough to *actually* enable another practitioner to replicate their invention.

If you have a pharmaceutical drug that you&#39;ve generated data with and you want to prove to a potentially adversarial entity (e.g. a big pharma company on an M&amp;A search, an investor holding discussions with competitors or with a competitive portfolio company, a frenemy development partner whose data security practices you don&#39;t trust) that you&#39;ve generated data for a drug without disclosing its structure, zero-knowledge proofs would be phenomenal.   </p>\n\n<p>The same is true for patenting - if you take a look at some biopharmaceutical patents out there (like <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170290914A1/en\">this one</a> - ultimately rejected/abandoned, but indicative of the typical patenting approach), they take an obfuscation-based approach to patenting, including hundreds of possible sequences or structures, such that they disclose enough information about their drug to narrow the search space by many orders of magnitude, but don&#39;t disclose enough to <em>actually</em> enable another practitioner to replicate their invention.

Big shoutout to this sub for alerting me to the news around Wonderland/ Abracadabra/ MIM. Early yesterday people were commenting on the daily about the news around SIFU which sent me into a panic to exit the positions i had associated with those above projects. I had MIM tied up in Impermax (which i think is a decent project) but wasn't fully aware of the scenarios that protocol had around exiting. I was stuck all day yesterday and first half of today in a position where the total supply was equal to the total borrowed preventing me from exiting. I spent most of the day yesterday constantly refreshing my browser every 5 or 10 minutes waiting for any liquidity to show up allowing me to exit. I was able to pull out around 70% of my stake doing this but was very stressed all day yesterday and the morning today until i was finally able to get out fully. The protocol itself did not lock withdrawals (which is a credit to Impermax) like many others disabling withdraw features and community members within Impermax were very helpful explaining how exactly it all worked. I was pretty ashamed i did not know exactly how Impermax exiting worked (i only practiced exiting and entering the positions when liquidity was plentiful not realizing what the worst case scenarios would be like). I also put trust in the Wonderland products due to convenience and not applying best principles around decentralization, transparency and other stable coin best practices such as what better stable coins like DAI apply. I was humbled yesterday on the consequences of prioritizing greed and convenience over principles and best practices. Anyone can make money in a bull market but what i learned is that I need to take into consideration the worst case scenario on anything i do.
