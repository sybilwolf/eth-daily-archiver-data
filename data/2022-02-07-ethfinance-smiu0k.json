But I clearly see downsides in this which some of you very eloquently put in yesterday&#39;s daily. I appreciate having conversations.</p>\n\n<p>This debate aside, I see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1490581937375027202?s=20\">Brantly&#39;s removal from ENS</a> following his <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FK4USv8WUAEkN0z.jpg\">medieval take</a> and subsequent doubling down on them as <strong>a net positive for Ethereum</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>One of my biggest worries for the entire project is that it somehow ends up becoming a partisan topic. The proportion of the population who just blindly follows what their &quot;side&quot; thinks is too big for this to happen without consequence. If Ethereum ends up being associated with &quot;one side&quot;, then at least half of the other side will be against it by default, no debate allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Brantly&#39;s comments had increased Ethereum&#39;s attack surface area. </p>\n\n<p>And doubling down on them was so dumb that I don&#39;t even feel bad for the guy.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your contributions, but good riddance.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-07 01:22:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hvxbz56","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_smiu0k","parent_id":"t3_smiu0k","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"Bingo.

If you say these things in an anonymous way online, well, you&#39;ll get responses from people who agree and disagree, but your opinion remains anonymous.</p>\n\n<p>When you broadcast mean and hurtful (or even hateful) things in public, with your name attached, to the world, there are going to be consequences for you personally. Others may not want to do business with you anymore. People who didn&#39;t know these things about you may no longer want to work with you. It isn&#39;t any different than if you showed up at my house for a party, said awful things, and then found yourself wondering why others didn&#39;t want to be your friend afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Actions have consequences.

Existing game properties will not implement this for commercial and technical reasons. Even then I am not entirely convinced the idea is widely applicable on a technical level. Consider an M16, a standard rifle in many FPSs. Each game will have a different model for the M16, suitable to the game's graphical style. The damage and fire rate of the M16 will be different in each game. Even if I used \"my\" M16 in Counter-Strike, then used \"my\" M16 in Battlefield, it would not be the same gun. Even if the underlying NFT were the same, the implementation (and therefore power/value of the NFT) would vary between games. \n\nA further complication is the merging of disparate games' economic systems. If Valve have tweaked the economics of their marketplace to achieve what they consider to be a fair balance, why would they then merge this economic system with another game which might have an entirely different balance configuration?
