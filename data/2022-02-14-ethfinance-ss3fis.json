RocketPool is the first, but won't be the last decentralized pool.\n\nThe way the spec is written, one lone validator fucking up isn't penalized much. But thousands of validators fucking up the same exact way at the same time get individually penalized way more.

It also means that if you solo stake, delegating your node to a cloud service is also a bet that the cloud service won't go down and lose you a ton of ETH in inactivity leak because all the other validators running on that cloud service are also down at the same time as you. Whereas self-hosting everything yourself, the inactivity leak is not a big deal at all. On the other hand, there is no \"RocketPool mass fuck up\". There are individual node operators who can fuck up, but it's 100% their loss for the first 16 ETH slashed, then their loss is covered by their RPL collateral, and *then* the rest of the loss is socialized across the whole network.

It's getting crowded here. Also interesting note: SporkDAO is a DAO that owns ETHDenver, ColoradoJam, and Bufficorn Venures. In November they opened up for minting (for 0.1 ETH) a series of NFTs, \"Bufficorn Buidl Brigade\", to fundraise. I minted one a while back to support the community and get access to some of the utility it offers (a little bit of exclusive access to stuff). In the last few days interest just *exploded* and all remaining bufficorns got minted. Seems that on opensea the floor price is just around minting price, but interesting to watch.\n\nWith multiple venues open at once I had to start picking what talks seemed the most interesting :(. Talks today:\n\n* [Angel Rodriguez of Cowswap](https://sched.co/xTe9) gave a general overview of the protocol. I had heard it mentioned here but didn't know much about it other than airdrop farming hype. It's a meta dex aggregator (aggregating the aggregators), and has a separate layer of offchain order matching on top of that to minimize fees. No real analysis in the talk, just protocol overview.\n* [Jan Gorzny](https://sched.co/xdO2) gave a talk on EVM to EVM bridges (this was swapped with another talk on some other day, I dunno). He compared polygon's native bridge, Multichain/Anyswap, and Hop Protocol. It was a slightly technical talk, reading into the transaction inputs and outputs and function calls. I learned a bit, but most of the differences he looked at were kind of minor design choices (like how fees are handled), and just looking at the txs you can't really compare the important stuff behind the scenes like oracles/multisigs/validators.\n* I spent a good 4 hours at [a sort of sub-conference focused on DeSci](https://opscientia.notion.site/DeSci-EthDenver-c74fc532cccc4979b9cf7977b4ee17ea), the application of crypto/web3 to the scientific research process. I spent 6 years in academia getting this dumb PhD thing, so I'm kind of personally invested in making science better. I hadn't heard too much about DeSci before, so I can summarize what I learned about the general problems and approaches. A few main problems are that journals are leeches and charge scientists both to publish papers and read them, reviewers don't get paid to do peer review, it's hard for independent researchers or small groups to get funded at all, and incentives are messed up around publication of datasets.

No offense to a lot of the other talks, but it was particularly interesting to hear about something that's not purely theoretical. Talked about IP-NFTs, which is what it sounds like: representing intellectual property as an NFT. Also talked about their process for funding grantees: first a review by longevity experts, then a 1-person=1-vote vote on discord, then a 1-token=1-vote vote by governance token.

It&#39;s getting crowded here. Also interesting note: SporkDAO is a DAO that owns ETHDenver, ColoradoJam, and Bufficorn Venures. In November they opened up for minting (for 0.1 ETH) a series of NFTs, &quot;Bufficorn Buidl Brigade&quot;, to fundraise. I minted one a while back to support the community and get access to some of the utility it offers (a little bit of exclusive access to stuff). In the last few days interest just <em>exploded</em> and all remaining bufficorns got minted. Seems that on opensea the floor price is just around minting price, but interesting to watch.</p>\n\n<p>With multiple venues open at once I had to start picking what talks seemed the most interesting :(. Talks today:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sched.co/xTe9\">Angel Rodriguez of Cowswap</a> gave a general overview of the protocol. I had heard it mentioned here but didn&#39;t know much about it other than airdrop farming hype. It&#39;s a meta dex aggregator (aggregating the aggregators), and has a separate layer of offchain order matching on top of that to minimize fees. No real analysis in the talk, just protocol overview.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sched.co/xdO2\">Jan Gorzny</a> gave a talk on EVM to EVM bridges (this was swapped with another talk on some other day, I dunno). He compared polygon&#39;s native bridge, Multichain/Anyswap, and Hop Protocol. It was a slightly technical talk, reading into the transaction inputs and outputs and function calls. I learned a bit, but most of the differences he looked at were kind of minor design choices (like how fees are handled), and just looking at the txs you can&#39;t really compare the important stuff behind the scenes like oracles/multisigs/validators.</li>\n<li>I spent a good 4 hours at <a href=\"https://opscientia.notion.site/DeSci-EthDenver-c74fc532cccc4979b9cf7977b4ee17ea\">a sort of sub-conference focused on DeSci</a>, the application of crypto/web3 to the scientific research process. I spent 6 years in academia getting this dumb PhD thing, so I&#39;m kind of personally invested in making science better. I hadn&#39;t heard too much about DeSci before, so I can summarize what I learned about the general problems and approaches. A few main problems are that journals are leeches and charge scientists both to publish papers and read them, reviewers don&#39;t get paid to do peer review, it&#39;s hard for independent researchers or small groups to get funded at all, and incentives are messed up around publication of datasets. Plenty of talks introducing very preliminary ideas for tokenization of research, crowdfunding/DAOs for giving research grants, and getting datasets on IPFS or similar stuff.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opscientia.notion.site/Funding-Longevity-with-VitaDAO-9d5e77a687514a74b63fd93b5eb597c5\">Cat-Thu Nguyen-Huu of VitaDAO</a> talked about longevity research DAO VitaDAO, which at this point is one of the entities in DeSci with real established history.

Any other type of illness you mentioned here doesn't cause flood of patients to hospitals crippling entire system.\n\nNo, you're missing my point here. Your argument about the flood of patients revolves around the fact that getting the vaccine yourself protects others. I'm saying that the same is true for other vaccines. Sure, to a lesser degree, but that's where it isn't black and white. If getting the covid vaccine reduces the number of people you pass the disease onto by 75% (this is just an example) then the measles vaccine might do the same by 50% (again just an example). So where do you draw the line? Measles outbreaks have overwhelmed pediatric units across a county or region before. If it were black and white, you'd either be mandating both vaccines or neither. So at what point do we mandate vaccines? You can't just say \"if the disease overwhelms hospitals\" as other diseases can do this on a local basis.\n\nPersonally, I don't think a disease with a death rate of 0.01% (0.1% before Omicron) is enough to justify mandates which are seriously damaging to the economy, civil liberties and are of course a slippery slope to other mandates. I will happily reconsider this stance for a disease with a death rate above 0.5%, at which point deaths are a significant portion of the annual death rate of everything at ~1.25%. But so long as heart disease, obesity, alcohol etc etc are killing more than covid then I don't understand why we are fucking up our society and economy simply for such a small number of deaths in relative terms.\n\nTo re-iterate, I have the vaccine because the numbers say it works. I think we should do everything we can to educate people. But I cannot back enforcing mandates. Especially in a society which doesn't mandate the banning of smoking and alcohol. If we mandated sobriety and banned unhealthy foods then clearly we as a society have decided that we are happy to remove freedoms to save lives but for our society to lose its collective mind over a disease killing less than heart disease, alcohol etc and to take measures which we don't take on the more deadly things related to other lifestyle factors like alcohol then I can't understand why vaccine mandates get the special treatment and we are collectively ok with it.

I know youre using argent, but if you have any funds on a cex consider using a bridge like layerswap to go direct to an l2 to save on gas fees.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-14 12:50:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hwycksr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ss3fis","parent_id":"t1_hwxxzy2","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/seanathanWaters","body":"Thank you for the advice!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thank you for the advice!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-14 12:53:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hwyd25w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ss3fis","parent_id":"t1_hwycksr","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/seanathanWaters","body":"Pardon the newb question, but would using multiple Argent wallets add noticeable amount of security - particularly if each wallet is using the Yearn vault?
