Do they think we're running a conference with sessions like \"How to Scam Grandmas\", \"Rugging 101\", and \"Up and Coming Buzzwords for Attracting Normies\"? I mean... if I saw those in the schedule I would absolutely attend them but unfortunately this conference has too many nerds who are trying to build cool technologies.\n\nToday's talks:\n\n* [Colfax Selby, co-founder and CEO of GitPOAP](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTgQ/the-ux-of-staking-on-ethereum-and-why-it-is-critical-to-decentralization?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about barriers to entry for ETH staking, mainly on the UX side. Also made the beacon chain client diversity pitch. Our very own /u/superphiz got up on stage too and took some questions. Shout out to the Ethstaker folks!\n* [Max Fiege, co-founder of FIAT DAO](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTgW/a-fixed-income-future-for-defi?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) gave a talk about fixed-yield lending in defi. I was reminded of the defi insurance talk from a few days ago: in the real world it's a big deal but hasn't taken off on blockchain. Max suggested that the problem was that existing defi fixed-yield instruments were lacking in composability and liquidity. Kind of a dead-end for your capital that leaves you locked up for a period of time that feels like an eternity in this space. So FIAT protocol uses a MakerDAO/Dai style system to let people deposit their fixed income positions to mint the $FIAT ERC-20.\n* [As part of the DeSci series, Jack Yin](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/v4rI/desciethdenver-exploring-the-decentralization-of-research?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) presented his independent research on centralization in Index Coop's token votes. Index Coop has a 1-token-1-vote governance model, with a 5% quorum threshold. Jack analyzed \"critical voters\", who could singlehandedly decide the outcome of a given vote. If there's only 1 or 2 critical voters, that indicates centralized power. In an analysis, Jack found that of the votes that met quorum, half of them had a critical voter, and in 9 votes that voter was the same person (a known investor with 9% of the total token supply). This seems to me like a good analytical tool we could apply across lots of DAO votes.\n* [Following up on Jack Yin's talk was a panel discussion](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/v4rI/desciethdenver-exploring-the-decentralization-of-research?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no). It was advertised as a panel on how we as a decentralized community can provide peer review to someone like Jack. But, as with a lot of DeSci talks this week, it kind of devolved into a lot of navel-gazing, complaining about the current system and hypothesizing about an idealized solution. During Q&A, one crowd member did call them out as just all talking fluff with no concrete proposals. The panel appreciated the feedback and tried to get more concrete but it was still a little directionless. As soon as it was over I realized I should have asked, \"the big dreams about the future are cool, but Jack is here right now with research that deserves peer review; what can we do for him now or in the very near future?\" Oh well.\n* [AI Network and Soul Fiction](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/vBYt/how-to-buidl-an-ai-nft-with-ai-dao-workshop?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) had a workshop on creating AI NFTs. Sounded interesting and hands-on. It was kind of weird, maybe not particularly polished. But it seems AI Network is a L1 blockchain that also has some sort of GPU compute rental platform built in, so anyone can deploy AI models to a decentralized platform. Wasn't 100% clear. The second part with the AI NFT had participants upload some text to train a GPT-J model as a chatbot. You'd also select an existing jpeg NFT to use as the base image to represent your chatbot. The NFT and the AI chatbot are somewhat linked; I believe ownership of the NFT is supposed to give you permission to (re)train the AI model. I plugged in my [Bufficorn](https://opensea.io/assets/0x1e988ba4692e52bc50b375bcc8585b95c48aad77/2203) to make [Buffibot](https://opensea.io/assets/0xdfcef37a85997dffeec31052cd537036ef657285/2), and if you look under the description you can find a [link to chat with it](https://miniverse.afan.ai/buffibot). It's maybe not the best chatbot I've talked with, but definitely aligned with the training text I provided it.\n* [Daniel Olshansky of Pocket Network](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTh3/pocket-network-v1-hello-block?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) gave a talk mostly on the development of the Pocket Network's consensus algorithm. They used to be on Cosmos/Tendermint but ran into problems so decided to move and eventually settled on [HotStuff](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069) + Algorand's cryptographic sortition + [Zcash's FROST DKG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/pdf/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost-01.pdf) to make what they're calling *Hot Pocket* consensus. The naming alone made it worth it for me to cover this talk here. Fun if you want to hear a bit of consensus algorithm research!\n* [Jeffrey Bennett](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTh6/maximize-capital-efficiency-and-yield-with-balancer-boosted-pools?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about Balancer's Boosted Pools. I hadn't looked into Balancer before, but it seems the gist of it is that they do specialized AMMs like 80/20 pools and stable pools. Fully understanding boosted pools likely requires some more understanding of the linear pools they're derived from (which I don't have), but from what I can tell they're capital efficient, deposit assets into Aave to earn extra yield, and enable swaps between a bunch of different stablecoins in one place.\n* [Pooja Shah, Head of Product at Protocol Labs](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xThC/fvm-grants-bringing-filecoin-and-ethereum-even-closer-together?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about Filecoin. Apparently they have seen a ton of adoption in the last year (18 EB supply, 41 PB stored). For 2022 they're looking to deploy smart contracts running on FVM, which is based on WASM but has EVM compatibility. So in the same way that Ethereum enabled programmable money, Filecoin will enable programmable storage, e.g. NFT access controls and tokenization/governance of scientific datasets.\n* [Nikita Buzov, founder of Solace](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xThF/risk-management-in-defi?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), talked about defi insurance in general. Not a ton about Solace itself, but from what I gather they use bonding to acquire underwriting capital in exchange for their tokens through which insurance premiums are distributed. The cool thing is that just today they released their total wallet coverage policy, which insures an Ethereum address, with dynamic coverage and pricing depending on how much you have in which defi protocols.\n* [Someone at Polygon whose name I can't find](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/x1mG/all-about-the-zkverse?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) started off a session on their zk rollups. Talked about the tradeoffs between different zk proving systems and challenges like proving overhead and aritmetization complexity. Talked about Polygon Miden's STARK-based zkVM and how it's intended to be developer friendly.\n* [Jordi Baylina of Polygon](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/x1mG/all-about-the-zkverse?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) took the podium to give a wonderfully technical introduction to Circom, a circuit programming language and compiler. He went through increasingly complex examples of writing circuits, executing them, using snarkJS to create and verify zk proofs on those circuits, and even generate solidity code, deploy to Rinkeby, and verify a SNARK proof on-chain. It was kind of perfect for my level of understanding, and I learned a ton.\n* [Jordi Baylina of Polygon](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/x1mG/all-about-the-zkverse?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) gave a followup talk on building a zkEVM. Walked through what a state machine circuit might look like, then extended it to more of a processor architecture, and from there it's about implementing EVM opcodes. And in the end that's wrapped up in a SNARK proof that verifies the STARK proof of EVM execution. This is what they're working on for Hermez's zkEVM, tentatively on testnet in Q2 and mainnet in Q3.\n* [Brendan Farmer of Polygon](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/x1mG/all-about-the-zkverse?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) wrapped up the session with a quick, abbreviated talk. Brendan previously worked on Mir, which has become Polygon Zero. Talked about the work they've done on optimizations, such as Halo for recursive proofs and using a 64-bit finite field. [Read about Plonky2](https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-plonky2/), y'all. Definitely Ethereum compatible, with about 1 million gas to verify a Plonky2 proof, and likely down to 200k gas under calldata cost reduction like EIP 4488.\n\nHaha keyboard go brrrrrr. So does the weather. It started snowing this afternoon, sidewalks are gonna be a slushy mess again for the next few days.\n\nOh yeah, anyone else here in person ever want to meet up? I don't know if I have much insight to offer you, but I have greatly enjoyed all the conversations I've had with folks here.

But if you just completely censor it, it just goes &quot;underground&quot; to a place where these groups come together and can talk/plan/coordinate unbridled, horrible things that go completely unchecked, and groups have done serious harm this way, <em>anonymously</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Also, (((Shadow banning))) in SM has long cultivated its own perception of legitimacy, because ppl are massively losing trust in their government and corporations, which is who is doing the censorship.  This is how conspiracies start. &quot;OH, Twitter &amp; the Gov silenced this guy, he must have said something they don&#39;t want us to know.&quot; Then they end up down the rabbit hole and get fed by mis/disinformation on anonymous, uncensored platforms.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-16 07:45:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hx6nrwf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_stojvf","parent_id":"t1_hx6f2ox","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Whovillage","body":"Yes, thanks to Bitcoin maxis having such a huge platform to propagate their narratives there unfortunately isn't a great way to fight this.

They even had us clone the git and docker images at the beginning and we never did anything with them (running docker would have set the laptop I had brought on fire anyways). Sat next to Ginge.eth and she ordered delivery burritos for us because it was a tough talk, there was a guy with an SDR doing signals analysis in the back though with interesting questions.\n\nAfter, wandered around, ended up in the restaurant Algorand has rented and listened to a panel discussing fundraising, and they handed out a really nice beanie which was clutch since the temperature had dropped since the day began. Talked to a Russian VC guy wearing a NATO sweater, a guy from Metaverse Summit (I think) who demoed a cool NFT AR app on his phone to place and interact with NFTs on surfaces and spaces around us, and another guy working on implementing carbon capture through hemp somehow using NFTs while using the hemp products for things like chicken feed. I wanted to get into the main stage panels, but those are crazy packed and a thousand degrees.\n\nFinal talk I got to was Gnosis (previously xdai) chain, which was sick. Those guys have a lot of experience and know what they're talking about, and are working hard at it, with the 4th (maybe 3rd) largest DAO warchest to back them up. Talked about OpenEthereum project, gnosis chain, gnosis safe, and Austin Griffith jumped up to demo Nifty.ink, but as all love demos go part of it hiccuped, but it was still a neat demo and NFT application. Gnosis also brought Dappnode reps in to show how easy it is to stake GNO through their GUI, and everyone who was there and registered can potentially get 10 GNO staked, so fingers crossed. There's also a way to apply for 10 GNO through the gnosis page, I have the link if anyone is interested. Staking will also be available via StakeWise in a week or two, for fractional amounts of GNO. There's a future airdrop of Gnosis SAFE tokens to all GNO holders and stakers, similar to the COW airdrop, though they didn't say much beyond that. GNO staking has been live since December, has about 25% interest right now, and has grown 1000% in regards to validators and GNO staked, since you only need 1 GNO to stake (disclaimer I guess, I've been using dappnode since 2020 and am staking GNO through it). I had to duck out early to pick my kids up from school, so I'm not sure what else they talked about \n\nThe Castle opens tomorrow, so psyched for that if I can make it through the snow, and the Hydra party at the aviation museum sounds cool, there's supposed to be a drone blimp with IRL airdrops.

I appreciate the <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a> community because of how pragmatic and rational it is, so it makes sense that you interpret it as cringe, but theres a lot of other types of content consumers out there who just want to use their imagination and see the possibility. </p>\n\n<p>And over the longest of time horizons, I think the maximally bull case for Ethereum will be the one that actually manifests ;)</p>\n\n<p>That being said, when <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">r/ethfinance</a> upvotes this post this much, thats a lot of signal. So I would love some additional feedback from others who feel similarly about how we could change up our disposition.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-16 09:45:39","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-02-16 09:56:57","id":"hx76spq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_stojvf","parent_id":"t1_hx6bq29","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Vandelay101","body":"You guys going to have Raoul Pal on anytime soon?

The narratives online make this seem like some big political movement that's being shut down, but it's fringe, at best.  You can literally google [\"do Canadians support the protest?\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=do+canadians+support+the+protest)  and see for yourself.  Virtually no one I know is worried about any sort of overreach into our daily lives.  In fact, the government has used these kind of tactics before to break up protests for protecting old-growth forests, or preventing oil pipelines.  Funny how crypto twitter didn't seem to act all outraged for those ones, though....","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There&#39;s a ridiculous tweet going viral on crypto twitter right now suggesting that there&#39;s a bank run going on in Canada.
