Still tuned in to the livestreams until I could get back in-person though! Kind of amazing that it's been a whole week. BUIDLWeek is wrapping up and the main event is beginning. I think in practice there's not a really clear distinction between them, but the hackathon is officially starting up and some of the bigger keynotes are coming up. The Sports Castle (erm, \"Web3 Castle\") opened up as the main venue from here on, with a line of food trucks in front. For general attendees like me, there was a line around the block to get inside (not sure how fast it was moving). The covid-test initial check-in line has also grown around the end of the block and sometimes takes 4-5 hours to get through (or so I hear, glad I did that on Saturday).\n\nToday's talks:\n\n* [Alex Wykoff, Head of Product at stakefish](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xThg/ethereum-staking-services-increasing-access-while-keeping-stake-decentralized?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), gave a talk comparing ETH staking platforms. stakefish provides an eth staking service, with barely any Prysm usage at the moment. I actually chatted a bit with Alex over breakfast, nice guy!\n* [Allyson Downey, Co-Founder of Meta Angels](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xThm/changing-the-ratio-in-nfts?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), talked about changing the (gender) ratio in NFTs. There were a couple of interesting ideas. One is that apparently women tend to take a longer-term perspective in investments, and these are the kind of people you want involved in your NFT project for long-term sustainability. The other idea is trying to avoid disproportionately incentivizing the people who are already in the space. So using your NFT pre-sale/whitelist as incentives, maybe try to partner with projects that already have better-than-average ratios. Try to build your community around quality of engagement rather than quantity of engagement, and put in the footwork to help newcomers who aren't as used to the space (this is probably just good advice in general).\n* [Camilla McFarland, Head of Partnerships at Mojito](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xThv/how-big-brands-are-using-nfts?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), talked about how big brands are using NFTs. /r/ethfinance has a bit of a lukewarm attitude towards NFTs at times, nowhere near as harsh as elsewhere on Reddit, but when I hear a talk like this it gives a very different impression. At ETHDenver I've seen a lot of signs that brands are eager to get involved in NFTs and metaverse stuff, and there seem to be plenty of crypto people working to get companies set up to make and sell NFTs.\n* [Willy Ogorzaly, Head of Decentralization at FOX Foundation](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTi1/building-a-future-without-fees-positive-sum-economies?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), gave a very interesting talk calling for defi protocols to drop their fees and become free whenever possible. Shapeshift has gone this route, and any fees only come from the underlying protocols. Some talk about how protocols may be able to use the wide range of defi legos to still find a way to make money to pay the team. Side note: I remember some discussion a long time about how high-fee protocols would likely end up getting quickly overtaken by forked low (or no) fee versions. Has this happened much in practice?\n* [Mayank Jain, Founder of MindSpec](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZM/brainwave-generated-nfts?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), presented his project that creates neat visualizations of brainwaves as NFTs. The brainwaves could be recorded from a musician as they listen to their own music, which could have some collectible value. Can also use their platform to create your own if you own or can borrow a head scanner thingy, which would be a nice personal NFT.\n* [Caron Schaller, Data Scientist at BlockDaemon](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZS/where-the-bufficorns-are-an-intro-to-nft-data-analytics?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) and someone I've hung out with a bit here, gave a talk showing the basics of NFT data analytics. Presented using Blockdaemon's Ubiquity API, but the principles are fairly general. Looked at Bufficorns: what addresses own the most, when were they minted, how many unique holders, etc. Also demoed how you might analyze NFTs in a P2E game to find trends and make more profit.\n* [Bert Kellerman of Reflexer Labs](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZY/rai-the-first-stablecoin?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) gave an intro to the RAI stablecoin. It's a governance-minimized fork of MakerDAO, with only ETH as collateral (so avoids the problem of USDC backing Dai), derived from the Maker \"purple paper\" that never got implemented. But I remember from back in the day there used to be the idea that Dai would be allowed to drift from $1 over time, but I guess it was abandoned because people valued the hard peg too much. But anyway, RAI is free-floating, using a PI feedback control system they call the \"Money God\", influencing the market price to keep it in line with redemption price. So far price has stayed fairly stable, but notably the market price and redemption price have stayed aligned even under market volatility. \n* [Michael Kriak, Managing Operating Partner at ConsenSys Mesh](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZe/dao-or-die-the-future-of-pfp-nfts?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), talked about the future of PFP NFTs, under the tagline DAO or die. So as you might expect, he advocates for PFP communities to form DAOs with the NFTs themselves as governance tokens. Also suggested using DAO funds to hire people who know how to make franchises (tie-in movies or wider integrations or whatever) and to let NFT holders give the DAO permission to license/lend their NFT to third parties. Suggested looking into Ready Player DAO, Decentraland, and Bright Moments as projects doing the right things.\n* [Alex Elkrief of LedgerPrime](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZh/institutional-investment-and-trading-strategies-in-defi?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) (not Ledger) talked about defi trading strategies. There were some cool overviews of some existing liquidity incentivization models, and suggestions to look into Platypus, Lyra, and Gearbox for interesting developments. Their own product is Fractal, which is a fixed-rate (but >20% APR?) product.\n* [Mark Beylin of Myco.space](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZk/dilutive-daos-community-building-for-the-long-term?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) criticized fixed-supply governance tokens as giving away too much ownership early on, leaving no incentives to continuing development. And as all communities have some amount of turnover, eventually that means most of your governance is in the hands of people who aren't involved in the project anymore. Mark advocated for setting issuance to a known fixed amount per month, and possibly setting aside percentages (could vary from month to month depending on goal) for different distribution targets. My own idea from this: what if every year you started issuing a separate set of governance tokens, creating sub-DAOs that represent different periods of interest in the project?\n* With the \"main event\" finally starting, the [opening ceremony](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTSF/opening-ceremonies-for-main-event?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) (on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1301479728)) took place in the castle. I didn't want to wait in line for an hour, so currently livestreaming it from my warm cozy hotel room. Organizers mentioned that they plan to change things next year to accommodate the larger crowds, which is desperately needed. [Jonathan Mann](https://www.jonathanmann.net/) performed his song of the day on stage. There was an introduction to ColoradoJam and how it may bring tech innovation to CO. Joe Lubin wrapped up the ceremony with a talk of his own.\n* At the [opening ceremony](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1301479728), a lot of projects who I assume are the main sponsors gave very short talks on stage. It's not worth my time or yours to summarize them all, but I did find it interesting how many projects who are kind of competitors to Ethereum are here, along with some L2s. Rapid fire: Celo (generic EVM compatible L1?), Harmony One (a validium?), Metis Andromeda (optimistic rollup), Octopus Network (NEAR-based application-specific blockchain platform), SKALE Network (separate EVM network that relies heavily on Ethereum for coordinating validators?), Algorand (probably the least ETH-aligned, and ugh, so many algo drones spamming the livestream chat), and Filecoin (probably one of the more Eth-synergistic non-L2 platforms).\n\nThat'll do it. At this point I'm really starting to crave a quieter, more personal atmosphere to talk Ethereum, but I can tolerate a few more days of crowds. I would like to check out the Sports Castle, but to make it worth the line I think the plan is to head over early and buy some sandwiches at a deli on the way to throw in my backpack so I don't have to leave until I'm done and ready. I might miss a few interesting talks at the other venues, but with three stages in the Castle I should still have good selection.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver Day 7</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/stojvf/daily_general_discussion_february_16_2022/hx9olm1/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Took some time in the morning to drive home, do some laundry, shovel my driveway, clear my mailbox, and come back to Denver. Still tuned in to the livestreams until I could get back in-person though! Kind of amazing that it&#39;s been a whole week. BUIDLWeek is wrapping up and the main event is beginning. I think in practice there&#39;s not a really clear distinction between them, but the hackathon is officially starting up and some of the bigger keynotes are coming up. The Sports Castle (erm, &quot;Web3 Castle&quot;) opened up as the main venue from here on, with a line of food trucks in front. For general attendees like me, there was a line around the block to get inside (not sure how fast it was moving). The covid-test initial check-in line has also grown around the end of the block and sometimes takes 4-5 hours to get through (or so I hear, glad I did that on Saturday).</p>\n\n<p>Today&#39;s talks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xThg/ethereum-staking-services-increasing-access-while-keeping-stake-decentralized?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Alex Wykoff, Head of Product at stakefish</a>, gave a talk comparing ETH staking platforms. stakefish provides an eth staking service, with barely any Prysm usage at the moment. I actually chatted a bit with Alex over breakfast, nice guy!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xThm/changing-the-ratio-in-nfts?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Allyson Downey, Co-Founder of Meta Angels</a>, talked about changing the (gender) ratio in NFTs. There were a couple of interesting ideas. One is that apparently women tend to take a longer-term perspective in investments, and these are the kind of people you want involved in your NFT project for long-term sustainability. The other idea is trying to avoid disproportionately incentivizing the people who are already in the space. So using your NFT pre-sale/whitelist as incentives, maybe try to partner with projects that already have better-than-average ratios. Try to build your community around quality of engagement rather than quantity of engagement, and put in the footwork to help newcomers who aren&#39;t as used to the space (this is probably just good advice in general).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xThv/how-big-brands-are-using-nfts?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Camilla McFarland, Head of Partnerships at Mojito</a>, talked about how big brands are using NFTs. <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">/r/ethfinance</a> has a bit of a lukewarm attitude towards NFTs at times, nowhere near as harsh as elsewhere on Reddit, but when I hear a talk like this it gives a very different impression. At ETHDenver I&#39;ve seen a lot of signs that brands are eager to get involved in NFTs and metaverse stuff, and there seem to be plenty of crypto people working to get companies set up to make and sell NFTs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTi1/building-a-future-without-fees-positive-sum-economies?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Willy Ogorzaly, Head of Decentralization at FOX Foundation</a>, gave a very interesting talk calling for defi protocols to drop their fees and become free whenever possible. Shapeshift has gone this route, and any fees only come from the underlying protocols. Some talk about how protocols may be able to use the wide range of defi legos to still find a way to make money to pay the team. Side note: I remember some discussion a long time about how high-fee protocols would likely end up getting quickly overtaken by forked low (or no) fee versions. Has this happened much in practice?</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZM/brainwave-generated-nfts?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Mayank Jain, Founder of MindSpec</a>, presented his project that creates neat visualizations of brainwaves as NFTs. The brainwaves could be recorded from a musician as they listen to their own music, which could have some collectible value. Can also use their platform to create your own if you own or can borrow a head scanner thingy, which would be a nice personal NFT.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZS/where-the-bufficorns-are-an-intro-to-nft-data-analytics?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Caron Schaller, Data Scientist at BlockDaemon</a> and someone I&#39;ve hung out with a bit here, gave a talk showing the basics of NFT data analytics. Presented using Blockdaemon&#39;s Ubiquity API, but the principles are fairly general. Looked at Bufficorns: what addresses own the most, when were they minted, how many unique holders, etc. Also demoed how you might analyze NFTs in a P2E game to find trends and make more profit.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZY/rai-the-first-stablecoin?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Bert Kellerman of Reflexer Labs</a> gave an intro to the RAI stablecoin. It&#39;s a governance-minimized fork of MakerDAO, with only ETH as collateral (so avoids the problem of USDC backing Dai), derived from the Maker &quot;purple paper&quot; that never got implemented. But I remember from back in the day there used to be the idea that Dai would be allowed to drift from $1 over time, but I guess it was abandoned because people valued the hard peg too much. But anyway, RAI is free-floating, using a PI feedback control system they call the &quot;Money God&quot;, influencing the market price to keep it in line with redemption price. So far price has stayed fairly stable, but notably the market price and redemption price have stayed aligned even under market volatility. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZe/dao-or-die-the-future-of-pfp-nfts?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Michael Kriak, Managing Operating Partner at ConsenSys Mesh</a>, talked about the future of PFP NFTs, under the tagline DAO or die. So as you might expect, he advocates for PFP communities to form DAOs with the NFTs themselves as governance tokens. Also suggested using DAO funds to hire people who know how to make franchises (tie-in movies or wider integrations or whatever) and to let NFT holders give the DAO permission to license/lend their NFT to third parties. Suggested looking into Ready Player DAO, Decentraland, and Bright Moments as projects doing the right things.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZh/institutional-investment-and-trading-strategies-in-defi?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Alex Elkrief of LedgerPrime</a> (not Ledger) talked about defi trading strategies. There were some cool overviews of some existing liquidity incentivization models, and suggestions to look into Platypus, Lyra, and Gearbox for interesting developments. Their own product is Fractal, which is a fixed-rate (but &gt;20% APR?) product.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTZk/dilutive-daos-community-building-for-the-long-term?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Mark Beylin of Myco.space</a> criticized fixed-supply governance tokens as giving away too much ownership early on, leaving no incentives to continuing development. And as all communities have some amount of turnover, eventually that means most of your governance is in the hands of people who aren&#39;t involved in the project anymore. Mark advocated for setting issuance to a known fixed amount per month, and possibly setting aside percentages (could vary from month to month depending on goal) for different distribution targets. My own idea from this: what if every year you started issuing a separate set of governance tokens, creating sub-DAOs that represent different periods of interest in the project?</li>\n<li>With the &quot;main event&quot; finally starting, the <a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTSF/opening-ceremonies-for-main-event?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">opening ceremony</a> (on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1301479728\">twitch</a>) took place in the castle. I didn&#39;t want to wait in line for an hour, so currently livestreaming it from my warm cozy hotel room. Organizers mentioned that they plan to change things next year to accommodate the larger crowds, which is desperately needed. <a href=\"https://www.jonathanmann.net/\">Jonathan Mann</a> performed his song of the day on stage. There was an introduction to ColoradoJam and how it may bring tech innovation to CO. Joe Lubin wrapped up the ceremony with a talk of his own.</li>\n<li>At the <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1301479728\">opening ceremony</a>, a lot of projects who I assume are the main sponsors gave very short talks on stage. It&#39;s not worth my time or yours to summarize them all, but I did find it interesting how many projects who are kind of competitors to Ethereum are here, along with some L2s. Rapid fire: Celo (generic EVM compatible L1?), Harmony One (a validium?), Metis Andromeda (optimistic rollup), Octopus Network (NEAR-based application-specific blockchain platform), SKALE Network (separate EVM network that relies heavily on Ethereum for coordinating validators?), Algorand (probably the least ETH-aligned, and ugh, so many algo drones spamming the livestream chat), and Filecoin (probably one of the more Eth-synergistic non-L2 platforms).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That&#39;ll do it. At this point I&#39;m really starting to crave a quieter, more personal atmosphere to talk Ethereum, but I can tolerate a few more days of crowds. I would like to check out the Sports Castle, but to make it worth the line I think the plan is to head over early and buy some sandwiches at a deli on the way to throw in my backpack so I don&#39;t have to leave until I&#39;m done and ready. I might miss a few interesting talks at the other venues, but with three stages in the Castle I should still have good selection.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-17 20:18:23","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-02-17 21:15:27","id":"hxem7yn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_suhjiq","parent_id":"t3_suhjiq","score":37,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/kenzi28","body":"Wish i could give 10upvotes.\n\nThank you!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wish i could give 10upvotes.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-17 20:44:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hxep7qx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_suhjiq","parent_id":"t1_hxem7yn","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/llamachef","body":"I got in at 9 in the morning to the Castle and had no wait.

Stuff like how indigenous farmers can get paid for the trees on their land via carbon credits instead of having to cut the trees down for lumber. And how DAOs can play a role in that.\n\nNext wandered back to The Castle. Madness. I haven't been around that many people in such a small space in a few years, it reminded me of some of the big Ingress events I used to go to. First floor had merch and the main stage, someone was always speaking on it or playing an instrument, all about the Schelling Point and what that is. There was a stage in the next room over hosting panels. The 2nd and 3rd floors were packed with tables of dapps and tokens and the like schilling their solutions and handing out schwag, lots of stickers and tees, Polygon had sweet hoodies and water bottles and a free cafe. Also scattered about were bean bags, a laser room, can't remember what else. I grabbed some things, but I was mostly trying to get POAPs that were scattered about. The top floors were workspaces for devs and meetings, but also NFT displays and an arcade and something mystical I never figured out. Super interesting place. Food trucks outside that could be paid in BGT tokens that had been given to every attendee by Arbitrum.\n\nHeaded over to the Wings over the Rockies Air and Space museum for the opening of the Hydra area and party. Really cool venue for everyone, especially for the pilot types like me. They were still setting up for the opening party, but they had a stage in the middle discussing DAOs, legal structures and LLCs, the multi chain future (they kept referring to Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon as other chains in the same context as Solana and the like), and efforts to make the One Wallet to Rule them all. Interesting stuff, kinda wished I had stayed in the main conference area downtown to see other talks there but oh well.\n\nOverall take, very enjoyable for my first Eth conference. I've only ever been able to talk crypto with a couple people IRL ever, so being surrounded for days was quite something. Still super early though I think, I used knowledge from here and experiences to help others learn, like I had to explain what POAPs were to multiple folks, or L2s and how they worked and bridges and all. I really liked how there were folks from everywhere across the globe, just cool to see and hear such a diverse crowd with so many ideas. I also kept seeing the same people around that I had talked to, so that was neat \n\nLingering questions or thoughts I guess. It was really easy to get to talking and let opsec slip on real life details, or like trying to show someone something in a wallet and potentially doxing yourself. Probably not a big issue, but this would be the place to social engineer someone really easily. I might be putting too many DefCon type vibes on conferences. Same concerns with scanning random QR codes and connecting to wifis - the conference is rolling it's own fresh Unifi setup, so not relying just on the venues, and they changed the password daily, but it didn't play well with my standard VPN options to protect my connection. Finally, I have only glanced at the EthDenver hosts and SporkDAO so I'm not sure if this exists or not, but a ton of the talks were about social and environmental good, from UBI to banking the unbanked to carbon credits, yet I have no idea if there was any outreach by the conference to say help a local homeless shelter (there was plenty of homeless walking amongst all the crypto folks everyday) or to offset the environmental costs of the conference and attendees. There was always tons of free food and drinks and schwag, so it doesn't seem that hard that this and other Eth conferences could devote some funds to helping the local area and environment, it'd be great for PR outreach and countering the anti-crypto mindset. Idk, just don't thoughts that I'll look into more and engage more with the Cryptoradao (Colorado DAO).\n\nDef want to come back next year, probably will go for the VIP level to see what that's all about.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Today is probably the last day I can make it to EthDenver due to IRL things like work, but it was a fun day!

Finally, I have only glanced at the EthDenver hosts and SporkDAO so I&#39;m not sure if this exists or not, but a ton of the talks were about social and environmental good, from UBI to banking the unbanked to carbon credits, yet I have no idea if there was any outreach by the conference to say help a local homeless shelter (there was plenty of homeless walking amongst all the crypto folks everyday) or to offset the environmental costs of the conference and attendees. There was always tons of free food and drinks and schwag, so it doesn&#39;t seem that hard that this and other Eth conferences could devote some funds to helping the local area and environment, it&#39;d be great for PR outreach and countering the anti-crypto mindset. Idk, just don&#39;t thoughts that I&#39;ll look into more and engage more with the Cryptoradao (Colorado DAO).</p>\n\n<p>Def want to come back next year, probably will go for the VIP level to see what that&#39;s all about.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-17 20:05:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hxekphv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_suhjiq","parent_id":"t3_suhjiq","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/austonst","body":"Oh, you went to Schelling Point!

Why don't we worry about the U.S. southern border where the real invasion is?!\" Yes, all those 100k troops belonging to a nuclear power... in Tijuana. Gonna have to turn my brain off if I keep listening to him.\n\nAnyway, finally some action for us to discuss. Nothing we didn't expect. We've been talking about the indecision and SPY gaps at 444 and 452 all week. Today, in lieu of any large news events or reports (I haven't read housing yet, forgive me) they decided and the decision was down.\n\n* BTC closed back below all MAs and even a little bit below the Jan 21 breakdown candle top.\n   * [Last week's gravestone doji is currently playing out](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2PdUtS6d/), needing only to remain at this price to be confirmed. Watch out in case this goes full evening star into the weekend.\n   * There's a zone of support from about 39k (50 fib) down to 37k (volume shelf pivot). Test, hold, and don't set a lower low, good chance this recovers.\n   * The daily golden cross was narrowly averted by bears yesterday. The 20D SMA is now just $11 below the 50D. Key moments.\n* ETH is a bit weaker on a macro scale, but has a similar zone of support to watch between 2870-2770.\n* SPY (437.06) broke down through the 444 gap as we said it could, on higher but not particularly strong volume. It's a downtrend confirmation, but not one to panic over yet.\n   * Expect them to test the 435 low for the week tomorrow *regardless* of whether they want to close up or down. Bulls will want to draw in short squeezes and bears will want to break. I'd be shocked if it doesn't at least touch.\n   * Next big supports if that doesn't hold are 433, 427, and the big chumba wumba 420. As we discussed in January, a breakdown of 420 means bear market for the whole economic class.\n   * To reverse this trend, gotta poke the head back above 444 pivot and then the 452 gap. The gap at 460 where a lot of bulls thought we could reach is getting too far back in time. Recall that *all gaps fill*, but the vast vast majority fill within 3-4 trading days and if they don't it can take weeks or months.\n   * Still, volatility is high and today is options expiry. Weird. Shit. Can/Will. Happen. Options range is still ridiculous from 425 (which would be nasty, breaking two of the aforementioned supports) to 460 (that magic gap number).\n   * With SPY, QQQ, and DIA all below recent closes (and DIA actually setting a brief lower low), that would suggest more downside. With volatility, options, and general contrarian factors? Maybe it's not so bad.\n* IWM (201.20), the tiny shiny light of hope still left. Higher highs and lows. Bears still couldn't get it below 200 even with today's shenanigans. Granted, bulls couldn't break 207 either.\n   * Y[es it broke its recent uptrend and yes it's being rejected at the 50fib](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DMpTcQkN/) (suggesting a bear flag breakdown), but look it also \"broke\" that uptrend back on the 11th and still was fine. Trend lines can be moved, ignored, they're just hints.\n   * Break 200 and break 191? Bad news.\n   * Retake 205 and retake 208? Good news, possibly for the whole market. Small caps are the risk-on canary.\n* VIX (28.10) - still above 20, still scary.\n   * It stopped trading yesterday at the 28 gap, but it's on higher highs and lows. Gaps are like speed pads in a racing game. Test, break, and upgap? Market could be in for another ride. 32 would be a target and we'd be in a nasty downtrend.\n   * The King of the Bears is of course the VIX gap at 45 (yes, 45, the covid gap). It's not been filled in two years and it *will fill* someday. That day will be a capitulation bottom and we'll all be shitting our britches and buying up a storm. Personally, I'd love for this to be in March and go UpOnly throughout 2022.\n* What happened in individual stocks that we can look to for hints?\n   * Apple, back on the 168 pivot. The market leader is the only thing holding up the market at this point. It's the only MAAMA stock not correcting yet. Lose the 168-166 region? Big downturn\n   * Microsoft (290), basically the corrective version of Apple. About to set a weekly lower low.\n   * Tesla (876), can't seem to break bullish above 940. It's in a shooting star weekly. 830 and 800 are must-holds.\n\nCheers, stay safe, manage risk, ride the wave.\n\nedit: London's been a decent predictor of the decisions the market's made this week. We'll see how they open in about seven hours.\n\nedit 2: finally read the housing and it looks like permits beat? maybe the market's wielding that as a strength to hide a dip behind... existing sales are tomorrow but i don't expect that to do much.\n\nedit: earnings yikes yesterday. Walmart barely beat (which is effectively negative in this environment). Roku beat.
