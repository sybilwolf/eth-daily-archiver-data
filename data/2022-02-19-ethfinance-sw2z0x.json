His slides weren't working, so given the short verbal-only talk, along with saying his webpage detailing the vulnerability is better, I'll just [link that here](https://www.saurik.com/optimism.html). Conclusion is to measure twice, cut once; *not* move fast and break things.\n* [EG Galano of Infura](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTSO/the-evolution-of-blockchain-infrastructure?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about the evolution of blockchain infrastructure. Took a step back to remember how revolutionary Metamask + Infura was for UX and onboarding, though we take it for granted now. Talked about Infura Transactions (ITX), not sure if this is established or new, but lets people abstract away gas concerns as another step towards usability/onboarding. Talked about concerns over API reliance, but tried to emphasize that nobody is *reliant* on Infura, there are alternatives so it's okay.\n* [A panel talked about the road to Ethereum 2.0](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xdNG/the-road-to-ethereum-20?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no). The questions asked tended to be pretty simple, more like clearing up the common misunderstandings rather than really giving a deep dive. Mentions of the triple halvening and a future of deflationary ETH, and a suggestion that this time next year sharding will be the big topic.\n* [Griff Green of Giveth.io](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTSX/the-biggest-web3-opportunity-that-no-one-is-talking-about?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about public goods, especially in the context of the large size of the non-profit sector and capturing that in crypto. As opposed to scarcity economics and traditional abundance economics (subject to tragedy of the commons), \"regenerative economies\" incentive production and distribution of abundant public goods. Talked about Giveth.io for meatspace nonprofits with token incentives for donation.\n* [Carl Beekhuizen, Researcher at the Ethereum Foundation](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTVa/distributed-validators-improving-staking-no-matter-your-eth-balance?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), gave an overview of distributed validator technology. In general, the participants hold pieces of a shared key, each run their own nodes, but communicate to sign shared messages. Uses [sss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing), threshold BLS signatures, and BFT consensus to handle offline or malicious participants (and client bugs). [Specs for the protocol](https://github.com/ethereum/distributed-validator-specs) are up; as usual the EF manages the spec but not any implementations. [Aditya Asgaonkar of the EF](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTj8/distributed-validator-technology?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) gave a more technical talk earlier, but it wasn't in the Castle so I missed it.

She acknowledged how innovative Metamask was originally, but criticized the move to closed-source code and high swap fees that go straight to ConsenSys rather than users. Tally is a new wallet they're advertising as community driven, to be released in Q1. I like the idea, but it sounded like they're trying to put too many partnered defi integrations straight into the wallet which sounds like a mess to me.\n* [Nikola Klipa of DeFi Saver](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTVs/to-automate-and-protect-creating-automated-defi-strategies?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about the past and future of DeFi Saver. Fun talk. Talked about their recipe creator (which can combine multiple defi steps into one transaction) and its future integration with a set of triggers to create automated investment strategies.\n* [Danny Ryan of the Ethereum Foundation](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTSv/ethereum-proof-of-stake-and-our-solar-punk-future?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about the merge, giving a nice visualization of how the execution layer will hop over from the PoW chain to the beacon chain. Talked about a few of the issues found during Kintsugi and ongoing preparation for Kiln. Still on track to get the merge in before the difficulty bomb goes off in June/July. There will be a \"mini-danksharding\" project in the hackathon this weekend, keep an eye out for that.\n* [A series of two panels](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTT1/a-multi-chain-future?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) discussed a multi-chain future. Different perspectives on Vitalik's recent comments about cross-chain vs multi-chain. I'm going to call out /r/ethfinance for not quite giving the current multi-chain situation the attention it gets elsewhere, even at an Ethereum-aligned conference like this one. We've got a lot of representatives from, and attendee interest in, other L1s. When the panel talked about the EVM, the general consensus was that it's good but really benefits from years of toolkit development and developer training, and WASM is maybe the future once it gets momentum. Panel was split but leaning towards bearish on application specific blockchains, because neither Polkadot nor Cosmos have played out that way, and composability is too important to break.\n\nI'm actually over Reddit's 10k character limit today, wow.

Felt pretty off the cuff, but the dude's mind is just so packed with ideas that we just got a nice Vitty B stream of consciousness for half an hour. There were some recurring themes. He thinks government could benefit from high-bandwidth, high-security democracy and better alignment of incentives of inhabitants of a city and the city itself. He thinks that the way to make government more \"digital\" is not by having governments implement crypto themselves, but by creating a useful tool and then finding the right people/places to implement it. For example, quadratic funding originated in crypto but may be applied to real-world public goods, and maybe a Texas DAO should just grow organically as citizens join it, until it becomes big enough to have political power.

Found myself zoning out during talks and panels today, and didn't find as many of them interesting enough to take notes on. I think that's probably fair; you can only go to so many sessions titled \"The Future of NFTs\" before you know the general talking points. But I took the chance to check out everything in the art gallery, buy a t-shirt and bufficorn plushie, and at least take a quick glimpse at all the company booths.\n\nToday's talks:\n\n* [Martin Derka of Quantstamp](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTTq/evm-to-evm-chain-bridges-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about potential avenues for bridge attacks. This was nice and detailed. There are multiple potential problems that can arise from problems in the *token contracts*, even if the bridge is fine (be careful with approvals). Since bridges cross multiple consensus regions, it is possible to deposit to a bridge, withdraw on the other side, then 51% attack the first chain to undo the deposit without affecting the receiving chain. It only costs [$1.5 million to 51% attack Ethereum for an hour](https://www.crypto51.app/), so it's easy to see how an attack could be profitable.\n* [Bill Warren, Executive Steward of Product and Technology at Opolis](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTTw/the-future-of-work-is-crypto?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), gave a talk on Opolis, which I still don't entirely get. It seems like it's a DAO that gives independent workers the same kinds of benefits packages they would get as full-time employees (in the messed-up USA system). I think this means that you become legally \"employed\" by the DAO (or officially its wrapper company) and the assorted work you take on is run through the DAO. So you're officially on the DAO's payroll and get their benefits, but still get to do your independent work as before.\n* [Kristen Smith, Executive Director at the Blockchain Association](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTWS/how-to-mobilize-and-achieve-smart-policy-in-washington?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about the state of crypto/web3 advocacy in Washington (i.e. the US federal government). She thinks we as an ecosystem actually have a good amount of power now, but the road ahead is still going to be bumpy. If you're running a crypto project, she advised that you get a lawyer, both to understand the risks and to indicate a demand for this field to the higher-ups. In terms of what politicians understand, we've come the furthest on stablecoins, and are the furthest behind on securities in crypto land. There is not much talk about DAOs yet, but that's an area where the states may have a bigger role.\n* [Denko Mancheski, CEO of Reef](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTWV/how-infrastructure-flexibility-and-multi-vm-blockchains-are-leading-web-3?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), talked about infrastructure flexibility and multi-VM architectures. I mention this talk not because it was particularly compelling but because it's reflective of important current trends. Reef is a Substrate based chain with nPoS consensus (which seems like dPoS with extra steps) and support for multiple VMs. This is a huge deal now: all the competing chains are simultaneously trying to make their own \"better\" VMs (generally by using javascript, python, or rust as the smart contract language) while still trying to court existing Ethereum developers by providing EVM compatibility. I really didn't get any impression that Reef is aligned with Ethereum or its wider ecosystem; they just threw a bunch of sponsorship money at the conference and are here to poach our devs. Fine, there is definitely room in the ecosystem for a multi-VM chain, but that is a really crowded space right now and I don't see any particular reason why Reef will be the winner there. I don't mean to come across as hostile, but definitely skeptical.\n* [Asta Li, Co-Founder and CTO at Privy](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTRW/lessons-from-self-driving-applied-to-web3?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about what we can learn from the self-driving vehicle space. Self-driving right now is in a \"trough of disillusionment\" after the hype of a few years ago died down, and crypto frequently experiences swingy boom and bust cycles. The main point is: the self-driving companies that are still in the field are those who focused on tooling and infrastructure. So build for the long haul.\n* [A panel of some folks](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTWe/institutional-adoption-of-crypto?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) talked about institutional adoption of defi. Apparently there is a lot going on behind the scenes in companies that haven't publicly announced their positions. Plenty of companies taking on BTC and ETH in their holdings, and a good number trying to get into defi as we know it. Regulatory compliance is obviously the big stumbling block. Institutions are using defi protocols, but through systems like Aave Arc (permissioned pools where everyone has to go through KYC/AML).\n* [Andrew Yang](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang) got interviewed on stage. As far as I can tell, this wasn't on the schedule at all? Just a few days ago he launched [Lobby3](https://www.lobby3.io/), a DAO to lobby for Web3 in Washington. He made a general call to action, saying to support Lobby3 and crypto-friendly politicians in general. He says this is not a situation that some heavyweight industry member can solve; we need lots of good examples of Web3 helping people, and outreach to point those out to politicians. He thinks we have a limited regulatory window open now to make a big difference.\n* [A panel of peeps](https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTcA/modern-encryption-in-decentralized-networks?iframe=no) talked about modern encryption in decentralized networks. Among the modern cryptography discussed were threshold signatures, Ethereum keys for general authentication (data vaults), and PLONK.\n\nThat's it for talks and panels for the whole event. The hackathon wraps up in the morning, with judging taking place tomorrow. There's a closing ceremony/party thing tomorrow afternoon, too. Maybe next year I'll get more involved socially, but for my general approach this year things are practically over for me. I'll be driving out to Boulder for a long run in the morning, but then I don't really know if I'd get any value about coming back to the conference. There's also a ski retreat up to Brekenridge through Wednesday, which seems fairly informal. I'm trying to organize some backcountry skiing or skiing at other resorts that aren't quite as busy. Should be fun.\n\nTomorrow I might post about any final ETHDenver updates I hear. May keep an eye on the hackathon finalists. Will also post some final thoughts.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver Day 9</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sw2z0x/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2022/hxjrj0x/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>8 days of ETHDenver all day every day finally got to me a bit.

There is not much talk about DAOs yet, but that&#39;s an area where the states may have a bigger role.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTWV/how-infrastructure-flexibility-and-multi-vm-blockchains-are-leading-web-3?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Denko Mancheski, CEO of Reef</a>, talked about infrastructure flexibility and multi-VM architectures. I mention this talk not because it was particularly compelling but because it&#39;s reflective of important current trends. Reef is a Substrate based chain with nPoS consensus (which seems like dPoS with extra steps) and support for multiple VMs. This is a huge deal now: all the competing chains are simultaneously trying to make their own &quot;better&quot; VMs (generally by using javascript, python, or rust as the smart contract language) while still trying to court existing Ethereum developers by providing EVM compatibility. I really didn&#39;t get any impression that Reef is aligned with Ethereum or its wider ecosystem; they just threw a bunch of sponsorship money at the conference and are here to poach our devs. Fine, there is definitely room in the ecosystem for a multi-VM chain, but that is a really crowded space right now and I don&#39;t see any particular reason why Reef will be the winner there. I don&#39;t mean to come across as hostile, but definitely skeptical.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTRW/lessons-from-self-driving-applied-to-web3?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">Asta Li, Co-Founder and CTO at Privy</a> talked about what we can learn from the self-driving vehicle space. Self-driving right now is in a &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; after the hype of a few years ago died down, and crypto frequently experiences swingy boom and bust cycles. The main point is: the self-driving companies that are still in the field are those who focused on tooling and infrastructure. So build for the long haul.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTWe/institutional-adoption-of-crypto?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">A panel of some folks</a> talked about institutional adoption of defi. Apparently there is a lot going on behind the scenes in companies that haven&#39;t publicly announced their positions. Plenty of companies taking on BTC and ETH in their holdings, and a good number trying to get into defi as we know it. Regulatory compliance is obviously the big stumbling block. Institutions are using defi protocols, but through systems like Aave Arc (permissioned pools where everyone has to go through KYC/AML).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewYang\">Andrew Yang</a> got interviewed on stage. As far as I can tell, this wasn&#39;t on the schedule at all? Just a few days ago he launched <a href=\"https://www.lobby3.io/\">Lobby3</a>, a DAO to lobby for Web3 in Washington. He made a general call to action, saying to support Lobby3 and crypto-friendly politicians in general. He says this is not a situation that some heavyweight industry member can solve; we need lots of good examples of Web3 helping people, and outreach to point those out to politicians. He thinks we have a limited regulatory window open now to make a big difference.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethdenver.sched.com/event/xTcA/modern-encryption-in-decentralized-networks?iframe=no\">A panel of peeps</a> talked about modern encryption in decentralized networks. Among the modern cryptography discussed were threshold signatures, Ethereum keys for general authentication (data vaults), and PLONK.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That&#39;s it for talks and panels for the whole event. The hackathon wraps up in the morning, with judging taking place tomorrow. There&#39;s a closing ceremony/party thing tomorrow afternoon, too. Maybe next year I&#39;ll get more involved socially, but for my general approach this year things are practically over for me. I&#39;ll be driving out to Boulder for a long run in the morning, but then I don&#39;t really know if I&#39;d get any value about coming back to the conference. There&#39;s also a ski retreat up to Brekenridge through Wednesday, which seems fairly informal. I&#39;m trying to organize some backcountry skiing or skiing at other resorts that aren&#39;t quite as busy. Should be fun.</p>\n\n<p>Tomorrow I might post about any final ETHDenver updates I hear. May keep an eye on the hackathon finalists. Will also post some final thoughts.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-19 19:22:15","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-02-19 19:27:10","id":"hxnsg5k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sw2z0x","parent_id":"t3_sw2z0x","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/decibels42","body":"Thanks for these summaries.

Less decentralization can also mean less security. \n\nFurther, the L1s who sacrifice decentralization for lower fees don\u2019t meaningfully add scale in the same way that true L2s will be able to. So while they can technically handle more tps for lower price than ETH layer 1, they still run into bottlenecks and fee spikes at a certain point not really solving anything long term. \n\nKeep in mind too, that lower fees brings out lower economic value, so it\u2019s much easier for spam txs to fill up these chains quicker. Just look at Polygon OpenSea everyone has garbage NFTs sent to them because it costs relatively little. Are those transactions important? Nobody on ETH is sending NFTs to everyone because it costs too much. Lately Polygon has had to raise gas costs because their chain was in such demand, so they are now a slightly more expensive Polygon that hasn\u2019t improved its decentralization. \n\nThere\u2019s a constant ebb and flow of fee price, decentralization, and the mechanics to funnel through meaningful transactions compared to the economic value of the transaction. When your chain is less decentralized, then less free market solutions are also sought out because they can typically sensor order flow and make engineering decisions with a smaller team and validating nodes. At the end of the day, the only difference between ETH and Alt-L1s is ETH takes the most conservative approach to decentralization, and everyone else is making tradeoffs at the base layer while not really scaling with 100x improvements like rollups eventually will. So when rollups have cheaper fees, and are running on the most decentralized chain, what will be the reason to use Solana if they\u2019ve fundamentally limited their decentralization from day 1?\n\nI said a lot in that rant but hopefully some of it hits home.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s a spectrum at the L1 layer.

So while they can technically handle more tps for lower price than ETH layer 1, they still run into bottlenecks and fee spikes at a certain point not really solving anything long term. </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind too, that lower fees brings out lower economic value, so it\u2019s much easier for spam txs to fill up these chains quicker. Just look at Polygon OpenSea everyone has garbage NFTs sent to them because it costs relatively little. Are those transactions important? Nobody on ETH is sending NFTs to everyone because it costs too much. Lately Polygon has had to raise gas costs because their chain was in such demand, so they are now a slightly more expensive Polygon that hasn\u2019t improved its decentralization. </p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a constant ebb and flow of fee price, decentralization, and the mechanics to funnel through meaningful transactions compared to the economic value of the transaction. When your chain is less decentralized, then less free market solutions are also sought out because they can typically sensor order flow and make engineering decisions with a smaller team and validating nodes. At the end of the day, the only difference between ETH and Alt-L1s is ETH takes the most conservative approach to decentralization, and everyone else is making tradeoffs at the base layer while not really scaling with 100x improvements like rollups eventually will. So when rollups have cheaper fees, and are running on the most decentralized chain, what will be the reason to use Solana if they\u2019ve fundamentally limited their decentralization from day 1?</p>\n\n<p>I said a lot in that rant but hopefully some of it hits home.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-19 16:27:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hxn7cvi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_sw2z0x","parent_id":"t1_hxn11i3","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LeagueGreedy","body":"I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a long time, but it\u2019s great you articulated it here.
