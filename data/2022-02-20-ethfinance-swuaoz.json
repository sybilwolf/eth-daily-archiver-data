So... I don't really know what happened at ETHDenver today. I can say the following at least:\n\n* The hackathon wrapped up at 8 AM (hope not too many people took all-nighters). I caught a bit of the livestream talking about judging, nothing particularly interesting except that total payouts to the hackathon teams (between bounties and awards) are over a million dollars. Not bad. I haven't seen any official postings about hackathon results, but many of the big name projects we know and love started at these sorts of events, so keep your eyes open for news there.\n* I do want to repeat what Cin- mentioned earlier today: one project was a [\"mini-danksharding\" implementation](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1495538286332624898), which did not end up getting submitted as a hackathon project but should get everyone here excited.\n* I briefly checked the livestream in the afternoon, and the art that was on display (and others) in the castle was being auctioned off live. When I checked, the available piece was the \"first tokenized McDonald's application\" since we're in a bear market. The starting price was 1 ETH, but nobody seemed interested. Yup, this is /u/austonst bringing you only the most important news.\n* There's a closing ceremony party thing and both official and unofficial afterparties. If I were still in Denver I'd probably be relaxing in my hotel room anyway.\n\nAnd some final closing thoughts on the conference:\n\n* Someone a few days ago talked about \"finding your tribe\", and I agree. The Ethereum space as a whole is just too big now; if you don't find a smaller group to associate with it's easy for everything to feel impersonal. You can find your tribe online ahead of time, too, so you can use ETHDenver as a place to meet up in person and really get to know each other. Maybe a DAO or open source project you're passionate about.\n* If you are interested in attending at all, I would highly recommend finding a team and buidling something. I decided to focus on going to talks and absorbing lots of information instead of working on a project, and while I don't exactly regret it, there were definitely diminishing returns on the value I got from talks. I would have gotten a lot more value out of joining a low-commitment team with a fun but not revolutionary idea and just putting something together to show the judges. Also, if you're like me and consider yourself a generalist who follows the space as a whole, consider doing the following. Either come up with some project ideas beforehand or pick a track (NFTs or DeFi or infrastructure etc.) and a role (backend dev, frontend dev, business/marketing) and put in a few days of work ahead of time to familiarize yourself with that space. \"I want to build something but I don't have any specific ideas and am kind of a generalist\" isn't a great pitch to join a team. \"I'm kind of inexperienced but want to learn by working as a solidity dev on an NFT project\" is a lot more enticing.\n* I get a lot of my crypto information through /r/ethfinance and [The Daily Gwei Refuel](https://www.youtube.com/c/thedailygwei). Both great sources of information, but both filtered through specific lenses. At ETHDenver, I felt very well informed about core protocol development and direction, ecosystem health and adoption, major events (e.g. hacks), DeFi (but maybe not the most cutting-edge/degen stuff), anything L2, and the crypto-twitter-level debates over NFTs and alt-L1's. The biggest surprises for me at ETHDenver were the pure excitement over NFTs, the scale of the alt-L1 war and the specific battlefields it's taking place on (VMs, attracting developers, beating Ethereum to its own scalability implementations), seeing the actual impact of the ridiculous amount of money flowing into the space, the number of projects working to reduce DeFi risk (insurance, fixed-yield, etc), and the feeling that DAOs are on the cusp of absolutely exploding.\n* I also just want to make this clear: if you are considering attending ETHDenver or other crypto conferences in the future, just know that my experience likely will not be your experience. There are a lot of factors in my own background and personality that make the \"attend every talk then go collapse in the hotel room\" approach kind of fitting for me. But I heard so many times the opinion that the *unoffical* events were better than the official ones (more person-to-person interaction, I assume). And yeah, if you have a bunch of people you want to meet and want to network as much as possible or hack on what you consider to be an important project, you may not want to go to more than a couple talks. And that's great! Don't let me scare you off from what would definitely be a good time.\n* Oh yeah, I mentioned the size of the crowds most days. I probably don't need to repeat the descriptions again. I think this year caught the organizers off guard, but I did hear them mention that they will plan accordingly for future years. Fingers crossed that we get a suitable venue next time.\n* I had a good time! I'm not super satisfied with my ability to make friends or whatever, but oh boy I do not need to open that can of worms here. Personal problem, I'll work on it. I did learn a lot, and I feel like I'm really caught up on the state of the Ethereum world. I'm leaving the conference feeling inspired to get more involved (in research? DAOs? solidity projects? somewhere in that space), which I'm sure is exactly what the organizers were hoping to achieve. And finally, I'm glad that I was able to contribute something of value to /r/ethfinance. I plan to be back next year, and maybe I'll see if I can squeeze another Ethereum conference or two in my schedule in the time in-between. Nice excuse for international travel?\n\nSo that's it for daily updates. I'll be around though!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver Day 10 &amp; Closing Thoughts</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sw2z0x/daily_general_discussion_february_19_2022/hxnsg5k/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I spent the morning packing up to check out of my hotel, spend the middle of the day doing a nice long run in Boulder (as I said a week ago, can&#39;t slack on training), and spent the evening driving up into the mountains for some ski days.

When I checked, the available piece was the &quot;first tokenized McDonald&#39;s application&quot; since we&#39;re in a bear market. The starting price was 1 ETH, but nobody seemed interested. Yup, this is <a href=\"/u/austonst\">/u/austonst</a> bringing you only the most important news.</li>\n<li>There&#39;s a closing ceremony party thing and both official and unofficial afterparties. If I were still in Denver I&#39;d probably be relaxing in my hotel room anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And some final closing thoughts on the conference:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Someone a few days ago talked about &quot;finding your tribe&quot;, and I agree. The Ethereum space as a whole is just too big now; if you don&#39;t find a smaller group to associate with it&#39;s easy for everything to feel impersonal. You can find your tribe online ahead of time, too, so you can use ETHDenver as a place to meet up in person and really get to know each other. Maybe a DAO or open source project you&#39;re passionate about.</li>\n<li>If you are interested in attending at all, I would highly recommend finding a team and buidling something. I decided to focus on going to talks and absorbing lots of information instead of working on a project, and while I don&#39;t exactly regret it, there were definitely diminishing returns on the value I got from talks. I would have gotten a lot more value out of joining a low-commitment team with a fun but not revolutionary idea and just putting something together to show the judges. Also, if you&#39;re like me and consider yourself a generalist who follows the space as a whole, consider doing the following. Either come up with some project ideas beforehand or pick a track (NFTs or DeFi or infrastructure etc.) and a role (backend dev, frontend dev, business/marketing) and put in a few days of work ahead of time to familiarize yourself with that space. &quot;I want to build something but I don&#39;t have any specific ideas and am kind of a generalist&quot; isn&#39;t a great pitch to join a team. &quot;I&#39;m kind of inexperienced but want to learn by working as a solidity dev on an NFT project&quot; is a lot more enticing.</li>\n<li>I get a lot of my crypto information through <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">/r/ethfinance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/thedailygwei\">The Daily Gwei Refuel</a>. Both great sources of information, but both filtered through specific lenses. At ETHDenver, I felt very well informed about core protocol development and direction, ecosystem health and adoption, major events (e.g. hacks), DeFi (but maybe not the most cutting-edge/degen stuff), anything L2, and the crypto-twitter-level debates over NFTs and alt-L1&#39;s. The biggest surprises for me at ETHDenver were the pure excitement over NFTs, the scale of the alt-L1 war and the specific battlefields it&#39;s taking place on (VMs, attracting developers, beating Ethereum to its own scalability implementations), seeing the actual impact of the ridiculous amount of money flowing into the space, the number of projects working to reduce DeFi risk (insurance, fixed-yield, etc), and the feeling that DAOs are on the cusp of absolutely exploding.</li>\n<li>I also just want to make this clear: if you are considering attending ETHDenver or other crypto conferences in the future, just know that my experience likely will not be your experience. There are a lot of factors in my own background and personality that make the &quot;attend every talk then go collapse in the hotel room&quot; approach kind of fitting for me. But I heard so many times the opinion that the <em>unoffical</em> events were better than the official ones (more person-to-person interaction, I assume). And yeah, if you have a bunch of people you want to meet and want to network as much as possible or hack on what you consider to be an important project, you may not want to go to more than a couple talks. And that&#39;s great! Don&#39;t let me scare you off from what would definitely be a good time.</li>\n<li>Oh yeah, I mentioned the size of the crowds most days. I probably don&#39;t need to repeat the descriptions again. I think this year caught the organizers off guard, but I did hear them mention that they will plan accordingly for future years. Fingers crossed that we get a suitable venue next time.</li>\n<li>I had a good time! I&#39;m not super satisfied with my ability to make friends or whatever, but oh boy I do not need to open that can of worms here. Personal problem, I&#39;ll work on it. I did learn a lot, and I feel like I&#39;m really caught up on the state of the Ethereum world. I&#39;m leaving the conference feeling inspired to get more involved (in research? DAOs? solidity projects? somewhere in that space), which I&#39;m sure is exactly what the organizers were hoping to achieve. And finally, I&#39;m glad that I was able to contribute something of value to <a href=\"/r/ethfinance\">/r/ethfinance</a>. I plan to be back next year, and maybe I&#39;ll see if I can squeeze another Ethereum conference or two in my schedule in the time in-between. Nice excuse for international travel?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s it for daily updates. I&#39;ll be around though!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-20 19:18:57","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-02-20 19:29:37","id":"hxsdl7x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_swuaoz","parent_id":"t3_swuaoz","score":57,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hblask","body":"You should repost this tomorrow early for people who missed it today...

I also love the rumor mill and I do try to buy the rumor on occasion. Here goes:\n\nSome of you may be aware that Vitalik and Zooko Wilcox (co-founder of Zcash) are good friends. They've known each other for nearly a decade, and Vitalik says [here](https://youtu.be/gcV9KlnW-dc?t=92) \"I've been following the project almost since..even before the start, and I met Zooko for the first time back in 2013 at the first big Bitcoin conference.\" [Here](https://twitter.com/88crypt/status/1495123598784167936/photo/1) is a pic of them recently pranking each other at ETHDenver.\n\nIn short, they are good friends and frequently give talks together at conferences and both have praised each others ideas, work, and respective coins. Vitalik has talked up Zcash on numerous occasions.\n\n[In this talk](https://youtu.be/t62isi58XcQ?t=934)[In this talk here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t62isi58XcQ&t=934s) by Zooko at ETHDenver , he explains from 15:34-17:05 how in the initial creation of Zcash, there were six total participants. After the creation, only *five* identities were revealed, with the last one remaining anonymous as \"John Dobbertin\". You can read up more [here](https://z.cash/technology/paramgen/) on the creation of Zcash.\n\nIn short, the Zcash team will reveal in March the final member in the ceremony upon their Halo upgrade (gives Zcash recursive zero-knowledge proofs). **I am speculating now that the final person was Vitalik Buterin.**\n\nThis all may be a big nothing burger. Or, it may be something bigger. I'll admit that it is a bit of a speculative leap, but for anyone like myself, it *may* be worth it to get a small bag of ZEC. If Vitalik is indeed the final member of that ceremony, I expect ZEC to pump and I expect a lot more eyes to turn on to Zcash.

They&#39;ve known each other for nearly a decade, and Vitalik says <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gcV9KlnW-dc?t=92\">here</a> &quot;I&#39;ve been following the project almost since..even before the start, and I met Zooko for the first time back in 2013 at the first big Bitcoin conference.&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/88crypt/status/1495123598784167936/photo/1\">Here</a> is a pic of them recently pranking each other at ETHDenver.</p>\n\n<p>In short, they are good friends and frequently give talks together at conferences and both have praised each others ideas, work, and respective coins. Vitalik has talked up Zcash on numerous occasions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/t62isi58XcQ?t=934\">In this talk</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t62isi58XcQ&amp;t=934s\">In this talk here</a> by Zooko at ETHDenver , he explains from 15:34-17:05 how in the initial creation of Zcash, there were six total participants. After the creation, only <em>five</em> identities were revealed, with the last one remaining anonymous as &quot;John Dobbertin&quot;. You can read up more <a href=\"https://z.cash/technology/paramgen/\">here</a> on the creation of Zcash.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the Zcash team will reveal in March the final member in the ceremony upon their Halo upgrade (gives Zcash recursive zero-knowledge proofs). <strong>I am speculating now that the final person was Vitalik Buterin.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This all may be a big nothing burger. Or, it may be something bigger. I&#39;ll admit that it is a bit of a speculative leap, but for anyone like myself, it <em>may</em> be worth it to get a small bag of ZEC. If Vitalik is indeed the final member of that ceremony, I expect ZEC to pump and I expect a lot more eyes to turn on to Zcash. Cheers all.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-19 22:36:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hxoc6t7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_swuaoz","parent_id":"t3_swuaoz","score":38,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/laninsterJr","body":"Careful, VB is in for doge too.

The other day some legends and some people who really do put a lot in the community released their ones and I was happy for them and curious to check it out and maybe support a little bit. It wasn't on opensea so no biggie I went to another platform. Turned out those NFTs weren't even on Ethereum, they were on Solana. I ended up not engaging into those since they were on Solana so imo things are gonna be worthless there. And most of those things sold for total less than $1k. \r  \n\r  \nOn another note, I remember seeing Streams of Cobie discovering new artists and people were eager to support those. And since I can't afford to just go and support those dancers who made NTFs by sending them 1-3k on Eth, all of this brings me to this idea that's been on my mind for a couple of days. I'm going to contact a couple of those and register ENS names for them. And then I guess I'd create a twitter account and tag Cobie, Tetra, some hashtags and hope crypto twitter can chip in a bit and maybe we get like $3k for each of them (i know nothing life changing but that's still a LOT of money) so like 10-12k total. This last part feels more like begging to me so that would be somewhat unpleasant but overall the idea feels right and I'm willing to put some effort, time and spend some money that I'm willing to sacrifice by registering ENS names. And I feel like odds of this working out is like 1-3% (at best). I know I can't do much impact on my own and I still do wish those people who do things for free or low cost can be somewhat empowered, supported and appreciated but maybe I'm too na\u00efve, dumb, hopeful or just care too much. So before I decide to give this my best try and pretty likely waste my energy and money I'd like to hear your guys' perspective, thoughts, whatever else you wanna share regarding my idea.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A few months ago I started seeing dancers come up with nfts felt somewhat delayed considered NFT hype was quite a long time ago.

It wasn&#39;t on opensea so no biggie I went to another platform. Turned out those NFTs weren&#39;t even on Ethereum, they were on Solana. I ended up not engaging into those since they were on Solana so imo things are gonna be worthless there. And most of those things sold for total less than $1k. </p>\n\n<p>On another note, I remember seeing Streams of Cobie discovering new artists and people were eager to support those. And since I can&#39;t afford to just go and support those dancers who made NTFs by sending them 1-3k on Eth, all of this brings me to this idea that&#39;s been on my mind for a couple of days. I&#39;m going to contact a couple of those and register ENS names for them. And then I guess I&#39;d create a twitter account and tag Cobie, Tetra, some hashtags and hope crypto twitter can chip in a bit and maybe we get like $3k for each of them (i know nothing life changing but that&#39;s still a LOT of money) so like 10-12k total. This last part feels more like begging to me so that would be somewhat unpleasant but overall the idea feels right and I&#39;m willing to put some effort, time and spend some money that I&#39;m willing to sacrifice by registering ENS names. And I feel like odds of this working out is like 1-3% (at best). I know I can&#39;t do much impact on my own and I still do wish those people who do things for free or low cost can be somewhat empowered, supported and appreciated but maybe I&#39;m too na\u00efve, dumb, hopeful or just care too much. So before I decide to give this my best try and pretty likely waste my energy and money I&#39;d like to hear your guys&#39; perspective, thoughts, whatever else you wanna share regarding my idea.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-02-20 14:30:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"hxrc8sc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_swuaoz","parent_id":"t3_swuaoz","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SabishiiFury","body":"Dancers and nfts?
