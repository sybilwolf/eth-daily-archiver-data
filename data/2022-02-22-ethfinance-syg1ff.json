Marketing is indeed important and our grassroots efforts haven't really resulted in an explosion of growth yet(Although I think in general people are taking for granted the fact that rocketpool has only been fully launched for 3 months now if you look at many other defi protocols first 3 months the growth has been explosive in comparison). You can see in the network stats that a number of things have occurred some of which have been bearish for rocketpool and some have been bullish.\n\nFirst The initial growth in eth tvl was faster than I think most expected for the first month but it also leveled off fairly quickly. This to me says most of the internal community is running the nodes they want to and branching outwards is a necessary goal. This does not neccessarily mean marketing although that is important. Defi integrations are definitely the key. Once we get enough liquidity for maker to be satisfied every other protocol will open the floodgates as well if they haven't already. This will definitely cause more explosive growth like we witnessed in the beginning.\n\n2nd While the eth growth has slowed the rpl staked growth has been much faster than I think anyone predicted. We will be at 21.5% of the circulating supply staked at roughly 3k validators in a few days. We have averaged roughly  1 million rpl staked per month. That suggests that node operators are very bullish on the rpl token and I would say with good reason as the rpl token is still a highly asymmetric bet. Even if growth slows and rocketpool ends up becoming a negligible 1-5% portion of the total validators the rpl token will still significantly outperform eth. There is only enough rpl at current staking rates to support roughly 10K validators even if people start to collateralize at 35% (half the current average) its pretty clear that rpl does not need to even have 1 million eth staked to significantly outperform eth as an investment(even independent of the higher yield you will get on eth and rpl staking with rocketpool). \n\nThe moonboi 0.1 ratio may not happen but I don't see many arguing against other protocols as harshly(not that you are being overly harsh I just see others doing it) as they do against rocketpool.Getting double digit yield on a token that even in a relatively bearish case will outperform eth is a position nearly any project in crypto would kill for but if rocketpool doesn't instantly gobble up the whole market it is seen as a failing project by some.\n\n**3rd** There is one thing that could massively increase the growth of rocketpool and it is on the public  roadmap(although it is not explained how important it is except in the discord thread discussing it) integration with dvt/ssv. There are talks of letting overcollateralized rpl nodes handle more dvt validators via direct integration with rocketpool. This depending on how it is implemented could allow 150% nodes to run as many as 14 additional minipools not only solving the node operator limitations but also massively increasing the demand for rpl. Its important to understand that this could potentially increase the returns of a rpl node operator by 50 to 100+%! This is because they would be getting 14 more commissions.  If it turns out that we flip too far in the other direction(Now we have too many node ops instead of too much reth) then the commision rate will tend towards 5% for reth which means that reth is now the lowest commission, safest, and most decentralized staking derivative on the market. If you are looking for an unknown massive factor of success in the future this is it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>If anyone doesn&#39;t want to read all this at least read the 3rd point I make</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a bearish but fair take . Marketing is indeed important and our grassroots efforts haven&#39;t really resulted in an explosion of growth yet(Although I think in general people are taking for granted the fact that rocketpool has only been fully launched for 3 months now if you look at many other defi protocols first 3 months the growth has been explosive in comparison). You can see in the network stats that a number of things have occurred some of which have been bearish for rocketpool and some have been bullish.</p>\n\n<p>First The initial growth in eth tvl was faster than I think most expected for the first month but it also leveled off fairly quickly. This to me says most of the internal community is running the nodes they want to and branching outwards is a necessary goal. This does not neccessarily mean marketing although that is important. Defi integrations are definitely the key. Once we get enough liquidity for maker to be satisfied every other protocol will open the floodgates as well if they haven&#39;t already. This will definitely cause more explosive growth like we witnessed in the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>2nd While the eth growth has slowed the rpl staked growth has been much faster than I think anyone predicted. We will be at 21.5% of the circulating supply staked at roughly 3k validators in a few days. We have averaged roughly  1 million rpl staked per month. That suggests that node operators are very bullish on the rpl token and I would say with good reason as the rpl token is still a highly asymmetric bet. Even if growth slows and rocketpool ends up becoming a negligible 1-5% portion of the total validators the rpl token will still significantly outperform eth.
