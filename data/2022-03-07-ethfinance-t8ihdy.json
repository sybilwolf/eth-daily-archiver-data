Little has changed but I wanted to quickly do some bird's eye expectations.\n\nSPY traded the *entire week* below the 50 Week MA which is a sign of intense weakness in markets. Just closing below isn't so bad; in fact, that typically results in a nice bounce such as in 2019/2020. I'm also excepting the Covid crash. However, trading wholly below the 50W tends to bring into play some monthly averages. Prior to this mega bull in winter 2018, SPY tested down at the 50 Month MA. Now, because of how absurdly high up we are and considering it's still above the 20 Month at 410, a drop like that to the 50M is rather unlikely. Not impossible, but pretty unlikely. It's way down at 350. That's a market catastrophe, one in which anyone over 50 is going to be in a mad panic and liquidating to save their lives. It's in play but far more likely if a bad drop occurs is that SPY loses 410 but turns 400 (at worst, 385) into a pivot battleground and oscillates around there. Eyes open as always. And it could turn right around again at 425 for all we know. These are unusual times after all.\n\nAs for crypto, it's the BTC show until we exit winter. And yes, <20 gwei gas plus current momentum is crypto winter. This feels exactly like 2018-2019. Losing 38.5k to close the week was rough. That brings a battle at 36.3k into play again, which is the January low as well as the 100 Week MA. Funny how numbers tend to work out like that. In better news, the recent strength has made any potential capitulation much easier to stomach. The 50 Month -- where any crypto bear would likely see an absolute bottom in a worst case scenario -- has risen to 25k. Should be about $1400-1700 for ETH too. That's not too bad if that's the worst we see! And again, this too could turn on a dime and bounce right off the $36-38k range bottom.\n\nNews this week is pretty standard, tradeable stuff. JOLTS U.S. job openings on Weds (forecasted to be steady) and core inflation on Thursday (forecasted to be BAD, possibly 8%).\n\nNews *NEXT* week is the spinebreaker.
