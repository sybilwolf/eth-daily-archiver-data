I didn&#39;t date/party much at all (had a few flings throughout college and socialized, but didn&#39;t have your romanticized college experience) those years because it wasn&#39;t my priority and I was pursuing FIRE (financial independence) in hopes I could travel and spend my time how I want.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m at the point where I could stop working and travel (largely due to investing in Ethereum a few years ago) but I&#39;ve been in a relationship with my gf (25F; she knows what my plans for traveling are) for the past six months and things have been going well. There are a couple of red flags (mental health, promiscuous past), but they haven&#39;t been an issue in the time I&#39;ve been with her.</p>\n\n<p>Basically I&#39;m conflicted in a couple of main ways.</p>\n\n<p>First, I love my gf, but she&#39;s also my first legitimate mid/long-term relationship (first love) and I&#39;m worried I&#39;m ignorant/blinded by my lack of dating experience.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I worry if I break things off with my gf and travel for the next few years I&#39;ll settle in a city (probably my Midwest hometown city) and my dating pool will be more limited. I stay in great shape (lift heavy 5-6 times per week) and I&#39;m financially independent (assets generating my income), and I know I could date down in age but I just don&#39;t know how I&#39;d feel being 28 and dating several years younger than me.</p>\n\n<p>I think a lot of my worry comes from the feeling like time is passing by so quickly. I want children in the future and feel like I need to plan accordingly, but I also feel like I sacrificed a lot of my youth in pursuit of this freedom and I have the urge to get back some of those years of youth/dating/partying.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: I&#39;m financially independent at 25. Should I travel the world and party for the next few years before settling down; or should I stay with my first legitimate relationship, travel occasionally with someone I love, and focus on building my relationship with plans to start a family in the next few years?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-03-14 17:06:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i0op42q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_tdqip3","parent_id":"t1_i0oaen8","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/CellWithoutCulture","body":"Maybe she is the one.
