I was spending 4+ hours a day exploring the ecosystem (not just Ethereum, but crypto in general) and being amazed with all the possibilities. While I had played with crypto on and off since 2014 (was even considering the ETH ICO), it was definitely the awesome posts here that made me finally pull the trigger and make my first large purchase. Knowing next to nothing about finance and investments, as well as being very risk-averse, I had a large internal conflict about it, especially after I bought a large chunk right on the day before the COVID crash.\n\nLooking back, it is laughable that I considered it a big risk. Not because it turned out good, but because that event and the subsequent years changed my view on what risk is. I spent only as much as I was willing to lose, so the worst thing to happen was limited. What very few talk about is opportunity. If you firmly believe in something, it is better to try and pursue it (not all-in) than staying put. Obviously, it's important to think through \"What is the worst that could happen?\" and also opportunity goes both ways, but I now believe it's better to try and enjoy something than always sticking to the safe path.\n\nWith that, I have made it my #1 career priority to take the leap from my \"safe\" software developer job and switch to blockchain/crypto, preferably still this year.

I was spending 4+ hours a day exploring the ecosystem (not just Ethereum, but crypto in general) and being amazed with all the possibilities. While I had played with crypto on and off since 2014 (was even considering the ETH ICO), it was definitely the awesome posts here that made me finally pull the trigger and make my first large purchase. Knowing next to nothing about finance and investments, as well as being very risk-averse, I had a large internal conflict about it, especially after I bought a large chunk right on the day before the COVID crash.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back, it is laughable that I considered it a big risk. Not because it turned out good, but because that event and the subsequent years changed my view on what risk is. I spent only as much as I was willing to lose, so the worst thing to happen was limited. What very few talk about is opportunity.
