I had none of it. Here are the use cases I could come up with. Please help me add to the list.\n\n1. Tokenised property rights. Not only could this give you access to instant liquidity to equity in your own property via collateralised loans in DeFi, but this also solves an age old problem created by war. Often after war or regime change, land ownership is hard to trace back to how it was before. Records destroyed or intentionally modified has cost millions of people their homes. At least with tokenised property there will be no disputes over who owned what when. Sure, it doesn't prevent a hostile regime from creating a new property rights system and kick you out of your house but the records are still there if ever the hostile regime falls.\n\n2. In game assets. The popularity of trading CSGO skins proves this as a PoC. Being able to use these assets in DeFi or instantly trade them will be helpful. Much of the hate this gets right now is more from misunderstanding and existing hate towards crypto from the gamer crowd. Not all games will have NFTs, not even close but this market will grow.\n\n3. Tickets to events. Easily resold to anyone in the world with stipulations and taxes by the event creator possibly included on each subsequent trade. No more fake tickets either.\n\n4. Representation of custom liquidity providing positions in AMMs. Uniswap V3 is already using NFTs to represent custom LP positions. This has numerous advantages over the old fixed curve AMM model.\n\n5. Supply chain tracking/traceability and authenticity of a product. Want to guarantee the authenticity of a product? NFTs provide an extra layer of reliability to verification systems.\n\n6. Identity and documentation. Having a passport from an obscure country can be surprisingly troublesome even when you have visas etc sorted. An NFT based passport system used by many countries could save a lot of trouble. *Edit: 6a. Proof of Attendance/POAPs.*\n\n7. Domain names. ENS names are much harder to spoof than DNS names.\n\n8.
