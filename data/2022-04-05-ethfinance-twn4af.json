So without further ado, here are all of the use cases I can come up with for NFTs in the future:\n\n1. Tokenised property rights. Not only could this give you access to instant liquidity to equity in your own property via collateralised loans in DeFi, but this also solves an age old problem created by war. Often after war or regime change, land ownership is hard to trace back to how it was before. Records destroyed or intentionally modified has cost millions of people their homes. At least with tokenised property there will be no disputes over who owned what when. Sure, it doesn't prevent a hostile regime from creating a new property rights system and kick you out of your house but the records are still there if ever the hostile regime falls.\n\n2. In game assets. The popularity of trading CS:GO skins proves that the ability to buy and sell in game skins for real money is a desired feature for some gamers. However, as soon as you mention NFTs many gamers will get you wondering who shat in their morning coffee. Well, the answer is GPU miners. So while the recent big announcements made by companies like Ubisoft talking about NFTs have been laughed at, I believe NFTs in games will be big as soon as either the stigma disappears, or even better, the blockchain aspect is abstracted away and gamers don't even know that their in game merch store is now powered by Ethereum. There is no denying that being able to sell on the items you bought in a game you don't play anymore is a beneficial feature, though just don't expect every game to feature this. On a long enough time frame, it wouldn't surprise me if we see in game assets be treated like any other asset and can be used as collateral in DeFi.\n\n3. Tickets to events. Imagine a single decentralised market place for all things events. Tickets are easily bought and resold to anyone in the world and the issuers can even put stipulations and taxes on the resale of tickets. Furthermore, fake tickets will be a thing of the past.\n\n4. Complex utility in DeFi. The first example which comes to mind here is the representation of custom liquidity providing positions in AMMs. Uniswap V3 is already using NFTs to represent custom LP positions. This has numerous advantages over the old fixed curve AMM model such as better prices on assets like stablecoins and more efficient market pricing for other tokens.\n\n5. Supply chain tracking/traceability and authenticity of a product. I'm sure you've heard of this one before so I'll keep it concise. Do you want to guarantee the authenticity of your new luxury product? Or maybe you just want to know that the free-range chicken you bought for dinner is actually ethically produced. NFTs provide an extra layer of reliability to verification systems which centralised systems don't have.\n\n6. Identity and documentation. Having a passport from an obscure country can be surprisingly troublesome even when you have visas etc sorted. Anecdotally (not a reliable story at all in term of if it actually happened or not, but it gets the point across), I remember hearing a story about a fellow kiwi a decade or two back who traveled to one of the \"_____stan\" countries in central Asia shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union. When she arrived there, they accused her of faking a passport. It turned out that they had never heard of New Zealand and when they asked her to point it out to them on the map, it was one of those pesky r/mapswithoutnewzealand! After being held up for a day or so they finally let her contact someone who was able to sort things out and she was on her way after a nerve-wracking few hours. My point here is that passport and visa systems are not perfect and miscommunication and forgeries do happen. An NFT based, universally coordinated passport system used by all countries could save a lot of trouble. Furthermore, there are other uses to identity. Sybil resistance has long plagued the crypto space. How can you ensure that those 100 $1 donations in Gitcoin grants aren't just one user trying to game the quadratic matching system? Well NFTs which attest to your humanity are one solution. In a similar vein, POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) is a great way of tracking the legitimacy and history of another user. In fact, they're even cool a flex when you can show off that you're the coolest person at the event because you've got the u/superphiz [super phans POAP!](https://app.poap.xyz/token/2545657)\n\n7. Domain names. ENS names are a huge UX improvement as we all know. No longer do you have to be known as 0x1d83EA0b...\n\n8. Music and culture. There is so much to talk about here. But in short, creators can now skip the middlemen and fans can now show their dedication. This is memorabilia, reputation and fan clubs on steroids. Some artists can make more money from their 100 most dedicated fans than they can from millions of plays on Spotify. Furthermore, they can interact much better with their community with perks being attached to owning their NFTs. The possibilities really are endless with this one.\n\n9. (credit to u/annemnemosyne) Privacy! In his words: *ZK attestation badges like what Sismo is developing could make on-chain credentials much more private and flexible! Hopefully soon we'll be able to mint badges for a un-doxxed addresses that can verifiably prove things like \"My passport says I'm over 21 years old\".* I'd also like to add that ZK proofs will be so big eventually. currently we have to debate what's better, reliable reputation systems or privacy which allows the ability to be social on web 3 without doxxing yourself or running the risk of doxxing yourself. At the moment we have the former at the expense of not having the latter aside from layer 2 or DApp specific privacy solutions which are at risk of regulatory capture keeping out the average law abiding citizen. Well, soon, we'll be able to have both. ZK proofs let you prove you are what you say you are without revealing who you are.\n\nSo next time someone tells you that NFTs are a scam, send them this. It helps to concede that many of the existing art NFTs are a cash grab, but they need to know that that is just the first iteration of this technology. Just like how once upon a time. you may only have been able to receive an email from a scammy Nigerian prince, the next thing you know you're living and breathing on this once strange \"internet\" thing.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Since <a href=\"/u/jtnichol\">u/jtnichol</a> was keen to share my NFT post as an <a href=\"/r/EthFinance\">r/EthFinance</a> gem but I wasn&#39;t happy with it being such a rushed post, I told him I&#39;d refine it and improve it a bit.

Yet, imo, ETH will flip BTC within four years because the merge brings the money, ie. the profit. Why? Eth pays a lot more for PoW than BTC does, and after the merge, that capital drain will disappear.\n\n>**@epolynya**  \nLow inflation is certainly a fundamental tenet of robust money. Some others like stability & confidence will take time - ETH's current monetary policy seems to be successful but it's still new. Conversely, BTC's monetary policy has worked so far, but may not in the long term.\n\n> **@RyanBerckmans**  \nI think you're right that low inflation is necessary for robust money. Yet, PoS inflation isn't directly comparable to PoW inflation. It's because PoS inflation is a wealth transfer from non-validating ETH holders to validators, whereas PoW inflation is a capital drain.  \nThat's to say, miners are willing and able to spend up to $1 in external cost to capture $1 in emitted ETH inflation and fee tips, forcing miners to sell most of their earned ETH. In contrast, stakers, like every other type of ETH holder, merely voluntarily sell their ETH.  \nTo your point, low inflation is necessary for good money. Ie. Eth's culture of minimum viable issuance is necessary for good money. But, ETH isn't going to flip BTC because PoS has low inflation. The flippening would still happen even if PoS inflation was quite high...  \nbecause PoS inflation only affects the proportion of stakers vs. non-stakers. Ie. PoS inflation cost/staking revenue doesn't appear on Eth's P&L statement as staking flows are internal transfers between stakeholders.  \nIn contrast with staking flows, payments to miners (issuance + tips) are costs on Eth's P&L statement because they reflect US dollars that miners must remit to external suppliers to purchase hardware and electricity.  \nWhile Eth uses PoW, we should be extremely concerned about high inflation because it translates into miners being paid more ETH which they must dump. Ie. high inflation in PoW makes Ethereum less profitable, all of us less wealthy, and delays the flippening. But in PoS...  \nIn PoS, inflation is relegated to the less-important characteristic of encouraging ETH holders to stake.

Yet, imo, ETH will flip BTC within four years because the merge brings the money, ie. the profit. Why? Eth pays a lot more for PoW than BTC does, and after the merge, that capital drain will disappear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>@epolynya</strong><br/>\nLow inflation is certainly a fundamental tenet of robust money. Some others like stability &amp; confidence will take time - ETH&#39;s current monetary policy seems to be successful but it&#39;s still new. Conversely, BTC&#39;s monetary policy has worked so far, but may not in the long term.</p>\n\n<p><strong>@RyanBerckmans</strong><br/>\nI think you&#39;re right that low inflation is necessary for robust money. Yet, PoS inflation isn&#39;t directly comparable to PoW inflation. It&#39;s because PoS inflation is a wealth transfer from non-validating ETH holders to validators, whereas PoW inflation is a capital drain.<br/>\nThat&#39;s to say, miners are willing and able to spend up to $1 in external cost to capture $1 in emitted ETH inflation and fee tips, forcing miners to sell most of their earned ETH. In contrast, stakers, like every other type of ETH holder, merely voluntarily sell their ETH.<br/>\nTo your point, low inflation is necessary for good money. Ie. Eth&#39;s culture of minimum viable issuance is necessary for good money. But, ETH isn&#39;t going to flip BTC because PoS has low inflation. The flippening would still happen even if PoS inflation was quite high...<br/>\nbecause PoS inflation only affects the proportion of stakers vs. non-stakers. Ie. PoS inflation cost/staking revenue doesn&#39;t appear on Eth&#39;s P&amp;L statement as staking flows are internal transfers between stakeholders.<br/>\nIn contrast with staking flows, payments to miners (issuance + tips) are costs on Eth&#39;s P&amp;L statement because they reflect US dollars that miners must remit to external suppliers to purchase hardware and electricity.<br/>\nWhile Eth uses PoW, we should be extremely concerned about high inflation because it translates into miners being paid more ETH which they must dump. Ie. high inflation in PoW makes Ethereum less profitable, all of us less wealthy, and delays the flippening. But in PoS...<br/>\nIn PoS, inflation is relegated to the less-important characteristic of encouraging ETH holders to stake. PoS inflation is no longer toxic and expensive like PoW inflation is because it makes miners dump ETH.<br/>\nIn short, the thesis that the merge will cause the flippening because PoS is much cheaper than PoW hinges on three main points<br/>\n1. PoW (and not PoS) inflation is toxic because miners dump ETH<br/>\n2. Miners dumping ~4.5% of ETH per year hurts our market cap <em>way more</em> than just 4.5%<br/>\n3. BTC miners dump only ~1.8% per year, and after the merge, we&#39;ll go from ETH miners dumping 2.5x more vs. BTC miners to a post-merge state of no ETH being dumped at all to run the network (except a very nominal amount to buy PoS computers)<br/>\nIt&#39;s the above cash flows combined with Eth&#39;s excellent growth and the confidence-based nature of digital currencies that, imo, fully explains why the flippening hasn&#39;t happened yet, and also fully explains why it&#39;s guaranteed to happen within some years following the merge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>@RoninMM8</strong><br/>\nAlso probably worth noting that the online sovereign bond market (ETH and other SCPs) is a way bigger market than the gold market (BTC), which at present seems to be how the collateral world is playing out online.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>one factor is being ignored here though, and that&#39;s taxes.

But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design, so it\u2019s developing next-generation product. That\u2019s 80% of it.*\n\n*Interviewer: You probably don\u2019t remember this. A very long time ago, many, many, years, you took me on a tour of SpaceX.

I think a lot of people think I\u2019m kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it\u2019s like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it\u2019s working on the Model 3 and, yeah, so I\u2019m in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I\u2019ve had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory.
