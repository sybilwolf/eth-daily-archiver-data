They floated the idea for a difficulty bomb delay to November, so when they delay it by 'only 3 months' people will feel relieved.\n\nPrediction markets say no to merge in July and August. For September its a 50/50 shot. \n\nThe usual eth media suspects will no doubt try to make a bullish spin that a delay to September doesn't mean the merge can't happen before that. They will say that it's only a worse case scenario. But we already saw this game being played during the past few months. First they said that the merge will happen in Q1 then early Q2 then Q2 then late Q2.\n\nIf the difficulty bomb is delayed to September the merge will not happen before that. People will get more relaxed, some will start working on other EIPs or go on extended holiday this summer. I've said this in the past, I may not be a developer but I know how people work.
