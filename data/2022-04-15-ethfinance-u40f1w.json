They clearly have not, and are still sitting under 1% [most of the time](https://aavescan.com/reserve/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc20xb53c1a33016b2dc2ff3653530bff1848a515c8c5?version=v2). A surprising amount of capital has been just dumped there and left to sit regardless of what else is going on in Defi. There is $4.5B in ETH on Aave mainnet alone earning ~1% despite common Cefi lending options at 5%, staking APR at 4% (soon to be higher with the merge), various LP options including single-sided LPing with Bancor at 4%. Is Aave really that much less risky than wstETH or rETH? Why accept the lower returns? Is this going to self-correct over time when staking withdrawals are here?\n\nI actually suspect not. I think part of the answer to this mystery at present and increasingly in the future is that other protocols are going to use Aave and Compound as a parking place for idle capital. Bancor for example is launching their \"infinity pools\" that park idle capital in \"strategies\" such as Aave. Balancer is following a similar approach. It seems to be the growing alternative to the compressed liquidity ranges of Uniswap v3 for capital efficiency. What I'm getting at here is there is a large pile of ETH sitting in Aave at irrationally low borrow rates because people putting it there have reasons for putting it there *at any APR*. It seems silly for us to be able to borrow ETH at 1%, sell it for rETH at 4% and profit from the spread but that's where we're at.\n\nSo how do we profit from this market inefficiency? Up until recently the best you could do to capitalize on this inefficiency was deposit some unproductive asset like UNI or MKR to collect the spread yield on staking income vs borrow rates. The problem with that approach was the liquidation risk of whatever else you're using as collateral. If the UNI/ETH price crashes enough you lose your UNI while getting at most 3% here. So you up the collateralization ratio to 200-300% which means the actual yield falls to 1.5% or less. Basically, while it was minorly profitable, unless you were pushing around $100k or more of equity with this approach it just wasn't worth the gas/risk/headache.\n\nRecently though, Aave added wstETH as collateral. This\u2026 changes the game. This removes the liquidation risk, allows us to crank up the leverage on that rate spread trade, and go really long on the difference between the staking yield and the borrow rate.\n\n[stETH on Aave](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&amp;marketName=proto_mainnet) has a max LTV of 70% and liquidation threshold of 75%. For those not familiar with Aave this means is if you deposit $1 of stETH you can borrow up $.70 of ETH. Using the same flash loan machinery as [The Double Logris](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-double-logris) you can get over a 3x leverage on this in one transaction. This of course means you can roughly triple your stETH yield in one transaction, going 3x long on the wstETH/ETH ratio and capitalizing on the irrationally low ETH borrow rates I discussed above.\n\nFor each stETH you have, you borrow 2 ETH on a flash loan, trade it for ~2 stETH, deposit 3 stETH (and earn the yield on it), borrow 2 ETH using your 3 stETH as collateral, and repay the flash loan. For the sake of demonstration, let's say stETH makes 4% APR and the ETH borrow rate is 1% APR. Your costs are 1% on 2 ETH borrow. Your profit is 4% on 3 stETH. Your net yield is ~10% on your original 1 stETH. Now, when the merge hits and the tips all go to stakers and the [staking yield goes to 8%](http://tokenomicsexplained.com/rpl) you'd be making 22% APR.\n\nWhat's incredible about this setup is it doesn't at all depend on issuance. All of the yield is denominated in ETH. No costs to claim a spread of tokens and sell them like Convex. No 20% Yearn performance fees to automate it. It's just clean yield, denominated in ETH, that can be packaged as capital gains in case this actually lasts a year.\n\nAs an investment strategy, being long the stETH/ETH ratio and getting paid 10% on that bet is pretty solid as things go. Here are the basic risks though.\n\n* As more and more capital is attracted to this new arbitrage position the rates will normalize. We've already seen the variable borrow rates steadily climb from 0.3% to 1.2% since stETH was added as collateral to Aave. If this spread diminishes as it should then you'll be better off in my [Logris Vaults](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/tgul2p/daily_general_discussion_march_18_2022/i152i74) where you'll conveniently get double yield on your rETH or stETH doing leveraged farming with Alchemix.\n* Imagine if Lido had a mass slashing event on their validator network somehow. Well, the ETH underlying the stETH would be less, so the stETH/ETH ratio (which you are basically 3x long on) would plummet to correct to the new redemption ratio. This event would create a bigger splash in Defi than most think and we'd certainly have more to be concerned about at that point than a liquidation event on $1B leveraged play on Aave.\n* These positions are public and whales could potentially go liquidation hunting on this market. IMO the arbitrage profit fighting against them is too high for this to be feasible, but maybe it wouldn't be if this market position grows another 10x.\n\nIf you accept all that and still want to get on board you have a few options at this point summarized in the table below.\n\nProtocol | Leverage | Performance Fee | Withdrawal Fee\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :--\nDIY [DefiSaver](https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/book) | Up to you | 0 | ~0.16%\n[TokenSet's ETHMAXY](https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/ethmaxy) | 3.0 | 1.95% | 0\n[Index Coop icETH](https://indexcoop.com/interest-compounding-eth-index) | 2.5 | 0.75% | 0.25%\n[Instadapp Lite](https://lite.instadapp.io/) | 3.0 | 10% | 0.01% \n\nETHMAXY and icETH are also tokens you can just buy on Uniswap v3. They *can* be unwound if the liquidity dries up but the process is a little messy since they don't actually use my flash loan logic but instead go through the recursive process manually.\n\nNow, for you degens out there who just aren't satisfied by making 10% on your ETH the crazy fucking pirates at [Galleon](https://www.galleon.community/) have managed to get their ETHMAXY token added as [collateral on Rari Fuse](https://twitter.com/galleondao/status/1511447140664545283?s=20&amp;t=wHNBxw9EQqVRiQwJktZjGg). So, if this 10% yield was empowered by a 4% stake to 1% borrow spread, imagine what you can do with a 10% interest to 1% borrow spread. The obvious math is (borrow liquidity allowing) you could make 10%x3-1%x2=28% APR on ETH. Now, there isn't $4.5B of ETH available for borrow on Rari Fuse and of course this means you're compounding platform risk at every step but 28% is just impressive. Post-merge, at 8% staking APR and if the current borrow rates were to hold, this could be looking at 64% APR. Now that's cookin' with Defi.\n\nObligatory self-serving [link](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harvesting-interest-rate-spreads/).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Bit of an update on a previous post of mine and converted to a website post for y&#39;all.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the beacon chain I expected that the borrow rates on money markets like Compound and Aave would normalize to something close to the staking reward rate APR.

RPL to run a node just isn\u2019t good enough for some people and it\u2019s just easier to deposit that 1.6 + 16 ETH into Lido rather than buy RPL with it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-04-15 07:23:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i4u2iu2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_u40f1w","parent_id":"t1_i4u1h67","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/dEEtoooo","body":"thanks, u/superphiz, for the tag!\n\nrETH liquidity wasn't an issue for the first four months following protocol launch, operator growth and rETH demand were growing fairly steadily together.   then a few things occurred around the same time that created an imbalance:\n\n1. with the protocol's dynamic commission rate (5-20%) operators began waiting for the commission rate to hit 20% before creating any new minipools then stopping again when it dropped below 19-20% range.  for the commission rate to hit 20% meant there was at least 1800/2000 ETH in the deposit pool.  over the course of weeks, following this trend made it more difficult to create rETH liquidity.\n2. in response to node operators waiting for 20% commission, the dev team decided to change the commission mechanics from 5-20% dynamic to 15% static.  during the two weeks following this announcement before the change went into effect, there was an enormous rush of minipools being created trying to capture any commission rate above 15%.  all of the minipools that would have been created over a longer timeframe (months) were suddenly accelerated into a two-week window.  this has created a lull in minipool creation once the rush ended, where we are now.\n3. at almost the same time as the 15% static change, the reth-wsteth curve and convex LPs launched with insanely highly yields.  imo, this third factor had the biggest impact on the demand for rETH.  despite the huge number of minipools created in about a week before the 15% commission change (more than 1000), that still wasn't enough to meet rETH demand created by the new LPs.  \n4. while #2 and #3 were going on, MEV bots struck and started minting all of the rETH the second it was available.  this made it impossible for non-bot users to mint rETH, which was very frustrating.  \n\nthe additional yields on the pools (in #3) have been eliminated, the bots have disappeared, and the demand has finally slowed a bit to the point where users can mint rETH.  the convex and curve yields may be increased again soon, however, though this time at 1/3 the prior levels with the hope of finding a balance in demand.

Now I find myself, in some bizarre twist of events, actually kind of cherishing this fucking JPEG. It's so strange. For what it's worth, this is coming from someone who has been active in the BTC and ETH community since about 2014/2016. \"What fool would give their ETH, or any money, to buy a goddamn JPEG!?!?\" I'd say. Never thought I'd find myself become the very thing I always made fun of. So that's where I'm coming from here before you continue reading.\n\nI've done a bit more thinking about EVMavericks and from a purely trading standpoint, actually think these could be worth more than what people are currently offering for them. Hell, I see offers for my EVM now at like 0.5 ETH on LooksRare but I still don't have any inclination to sell. Not only because 0.5 feels cheap, but because there is, again, some place of sentimental feeling in me. I actually don't want to give this thing up!? Anyways, consider the following:\n\n1. Anyone who has lurked or participated in /r/ethfinance for some time knows that it is actually a very tight-knit subreddit compared to other places, and certainly it is the closest knit crypto community. The community at /r/ethfinance is at the cutting edge of advances in Ethereum, constantly curating meaningful and interesting updates/developments/research going on in the space. Since Ethereum is by far the main DeFi chain (it's larger and has more TVL/developers than all the others combined), that really puts /r/ethfinance at the forefront for getting updates on crypto finance in general. IMO, this all makes being a member of /r/ethfinance a novel thing, and even more so if you're in that list of top 1,200 contributors eligible for the first 1,000 EVM mint. These 1,200 users are from the past year and were ranked based on comment number, karma, and participation in dailies.\n2. /r/ethfinance has over 80,000 members. Only 1,324 EVMavericks are available to mint. We are very close to approaching that final number, and I don't see them minting new ones any time soon, if at all. Once the DAO structure is set up I can't see the community allowing new mints. That would just reduce the uniqueness and novelty of them. Reading the comments on the sub, almost all regard these EVMs as something special/sentimental. I don't see the community reducing their novelty.\n3. Compare the supply of EVMs to the supply of 10,000 Bored Ape Yacht Club and 10,0000 Crypto Punks, which are nearly 10x higher.\n4. There are some very knowledgeable people on /r/ethfinance and no doubt some of the big names in crypto and crypto twitter all frequent there. I could possibly see EVMavericks picking up some crypto twitter mentions or even media mentions from big names. More exposure means generally means higher prices/volume.\n5. We are currently in a sideways/bear market (most likely). The NFT bubble has already popped. Given the buzz surrounding EVMavericks in the current dismal state of the NFT market, that tells me that there is some actual value there somewhere (likely coming from the points listed here). The fact that it has grown in floor price so quickly during this time period is actually pretty amazing. Who knows what a bull market in crypto (which would likely bring a bull in NFTs) could bring.\n6. Given the technical expertise of the members in /r/ethfinance, I could easily see some novel use cases sprout up in the future for these things. Who knows what that may look like. Maybe it's scanning for a free pass at a Consensys event. Maybe it's future airdrops.

The algo is what feeds the ad revenue.</p>\n\n<p>Then he talked both about more lax content moderation while also getting rid of the bot issues. Spoiler alert: you can&#39;t do both. Balancing these two is a constant battle that every social media company has to face, and there&#39;s simply no silver bullet. </p>\n\n<p>Wish both Twitter and Musk all the best but there&#39;s no way this doesn&#39;t end up as a shit show no matter who wins.
