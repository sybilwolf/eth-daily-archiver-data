So sit tight, DCA, and keep the leverage slider under 30x for a few months if the need to gambol arises.  \n\nPatiently waiting on a number of these recent airdrops to go live. Could make for some interesting action during a downhill slide. Thinkin' about a couple of trade strategies for these, but I'll probably just end up watching with popcorn. It's definitely airdrop season. People weren't kidding when they said the salt level was **high** , especially in the respective discord channels. It's getting more and more difficult to game these drops. I am happy to see that, as it's not in the spirit of the game to do so. \n\nAgain...I ain't no preacher man....but quit thinking about the drops and just start *using* the platforms that interest you. Expectations are the thief of joy. Go out and get those transactions going. Build up the \"on-chain resume\".
