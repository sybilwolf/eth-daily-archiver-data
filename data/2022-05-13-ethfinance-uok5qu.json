Not anymore. I'm currently enamored by the unrealised potential of Ethereum on the social level. It's messy and stickier down there, and no doubt there will be lots of failed experiments. But we, on Ethereum are pioneering an entirely new subset of investing via NFTs. We have this new marriage being born, where value investing transcends the typical tedium of capital inflows with expectation of larger capital outflows. A marriage where this mechanic is still present but sits alongside value derived on the social level.

I&#39;m currently enamored by the unrealised potential of Ethereum on the social level. It&#39;s messy and stickier down there, and no doubt there will be lots of failed experiments. But we, on Ethereum are pioneering an entirely new subset of investing via NFTs. We have this new marriage being born, where value investing transcends the typical tedium of capital inflows with expectation of larger capital outflows. A marriage where this mechanic is still present but sits alongside value derived on the social level.

That's like up to 125 kb of data your transaction can use, with EVM computation having only access to a commitment of it and not the data itself. It's specifically catered for rollups but because permissionless, anyone can in theory post 125 kbs of data in their own transaction and have it be provably on-chain forever.\n\nWith english language entropy being at about ~4.1 bits per letter, you can theoretically compress 250k letters into a blob. That's like 50k words which is pretty cool (or maybe 30-40k if there's overhead, idk). If you got ETH to burn it'll suddenly become much cheaper to immortalize yourself by batching your auto-biography in a few blobs. Or maybe you can encrypt the compressed data and use blobs for private storage of small text files with 100% uptime but you're kinda stupid to pay for that if it's purely personal use given all the other options available.\n\nOtherwise 125 kb can fit decent-resolution images easily, is plenty for SVG art and more than enough for pixel art if you optimize the format and such. I wouldn't be surprised to see those being used for NFTs instead of IPFS, with maybe an external service that takes a tx id and outputs the image contained in the blob and lets you verify for yourself that the image is in fact legitimate through the commitment. On the other hand, there will probably be a few very unsavory images being posted on-chain, and unfortunately there's nothing we can do about that other than such blob-retrieval services refusing to serve the data from those specific blobs which can only go so far \u2013 there will always be completionists who want/need the whole blockchain for various reason. But that's already an existing problem with blockchains anyway, I doubt it'd become much more common.\n\nOr maybe, think how posting data in blobs can accomplish proving the exact time the data was committed, which is admittedly already possible today with hashes, but would be slightly less clunky if the whole data was easily available and readable through the aforementioned service. Like for real-time news about big events it'd be cool to have the facts committed in data blobs, and then you can prove forever that such and such fact was committed in a blob at an exact point in time and never edited later. Obviously doesn't mean that the facts written are true, but if the transaction came from a trusted public key known to belong to a reputable news outlet (or through higher level abstractions like SBTs), the credibility could potentially carry on through time and make it a bit easier in the future to dig through all the different perspectives and come up with a relatively objective view of what actually happened as it happened. Still a lot of subjective elements to this whole idea but that's kinda inevitable.\n\nAnd of course with danksharding each blob goes from 125kb to 2 MB (i think? 1 MB/block target will become 16 with full danksharding. Or maybe smaller blobs but more blobs per block, couldn't find definitive info on that)\n\nwhat else could blobs be used for? i'll take plausibly useful cases as well as gimmick use-cases!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Trying to come up with non-rollups uses for eip4844 blobs.

That&#39;s like 50k words which is pretty cool (or maybe 30-40k if there&#39;s overhead, idk). If you got ETH to burn it&#39;ll suddenly become much cheaper to immortalize yourself by batching your auto-biography in a few blobs. Or maybe you can encrypt the compressed data and use blobs for private storage of small text files with 100% uptime but you&#39;re kinda stupid to pay for that if it&#39;s purely personal use given all the other options available.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise 125 kb can fit decent-resolution images easily, is plenty for SVG art and more than enough for pixel art if you optimize the format and such. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see those being used for NFTs instead of IPFS, with maybe an external service that takes a tx id and outputs the image contained in the blob and lets you verify for yourself that the image is in fact legitimate through the commitment. On the other hand, there will probably be a few very unsavory images being posted on-chain, and unfortunately there&#39;s nothing we can do about that other than such blob-retrieval services refusing to serve the data from those specific blobs which can only go so far \u2013 there will always be completionists who want/need the whole blockchain for various reason. But that&#39;s already an existing problem with blockchains anyway, I doubt it&#39;d become much more common.</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe, think how posting data in blobs can accomplish proving the exact time the data was committed, which is admittedly already possible today with hashes, but would be slightly less clunky if the whole data was easily available and readable through the aforementioned service. Like for real-time news about big events it&#39;d be cool to have the facts committed in data blobs, and then you can prove forever that such and such fact was committed in a blob at an exact point in time and never edited later. Obviously doesn&#39;t mean that the facts written are true, but if the transaction came from a trusted public key known to belong to a reputable news outlet (or through higher level abstractions like SBTs), the credibility could potentially carry on through time and make it a bit easier in the future to dig through all the different perspectives and come up with a relatively objective view of what actually happened as it happened. Still a lot of subjective elements to this whole idea but that&#39;s kinda inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>And of course with danksharding each blob goes from 125kb to 2 MB (i think? 1 MB/block target will become 16 with full danksharding. Or maybe smaller blobs but more blobs per block, couldn&#39;t find definitive info on that)</p>\n\n<p>what else could blobs be used for? i&#39;ll take plausibly useful cases as well as gimmick use-cases!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-13 16:09:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i8ih06l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uok5qu","parent_id":"t3_uok5qu","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Proof of datetime is definitely an application that would be relevant in a court of law.

You can do this anytime, price and time left before expiry are the two big factors in determining the contracts value (look up options \u201cgreeks\u201d to get a better understanding).  I would really advise doing more research on options before you buy or sell any.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-13 06:56:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i8ga7jt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uok5qu","parent_id":"t1_i8g3atz","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Jin366","body":"Thanks for the answer.
