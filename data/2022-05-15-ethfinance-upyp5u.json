The nature reserve WWT Slimbridge, in England, was instrumental in the successful breeding of Hawaiian geese in captivity.

Let me quote Hal Press Medium article:\n\n\u201cThe significance of the event is not that ETH will end up PoS. It is significant because the established equilibrium under PoW conditions will be flipped 180 degrees at one discrete moment. It is the transition that is significant. Given that most crypto projects now launch as PoS from the start, these transitions will likely be extremely rare going forward. Second, there needed to be an L1 with significant fee revenue to allow for a strong structural demand asset to be born.

It's inevitable that it will happen to some degree and we will end up with tokens that have *value* which can't be expressed in dollar or ETH terms. \n\nA recent example to illustrate this would be EVMavericks. I recall several people saying things like \"You can show that the EVM you hold is the one you minted, so it's more valuable because you get to prove you're an OG ethfinancer!\". It's like, yeah, we ethfinancers internally can agree that there's value here. Someone who made the whitelist can definitely use their EVM to claim more clout in the community than someone who just bought theirs.\n\nThis is not an economic thing with a dollar amount ascribed to it. It's an internal, social thing emerging from whatever the heck we-the-community decide we do with it. Not a perfect example, but a good illustrative one: I'm more willing to trust you guys and lend someone money if they're an active part of the community than some rando. Holding an OG EVM is just an agreed-upon way to easily show you are indeed a part of this community with enough clout to have made the whitelist at that specific point in time. So this could plausibly scale to something like ManeNetDAO running a simple dapp providing undercollateralized loans to OG EVM holders and rewarding liquidity providers with interests collected on the loan, with profits flowing back to the DAO. And just like that, your OG EVM has undeniable economic utility that a non-OG EVM doesn't. \n\nThere is an added *social value* to OG EVM's that can't be translated into a dollar amount, because obviously the minute you sell that OG EVM, the buyer has 0 claim to the OG status, and the social value disappears. So all the extra utility we-the-community decided OG EVMs have cannot be translated to a dollar figure. *But there's still a social value happening.*\n\nThat is, in my understanding, the underlying principle behind DeSoc. You get a token that's soulbound to your identity/wallet (or pseudo-identity to preserve IRL identity) and people ascribe value to that token based on reputation rather than dollars. And then way more use-cases can emerge out of blockchain stuff that aren't necessarily degen and financialized to death in nature. My puny little DeFi degen brain can still only think of undercollateralized loans based on algorithms that value risk/rewards that analyzes your reputation token with its repayment history and other various factors in order to have a fairer credit system leading to infinitely more economic activity and value creation happening on-chain.\n\nBut like, go a step further. Don't you see what's happening? With DeFi it's very easy to grasp. If there is a series of actions (i.e. smart contact calls) that one can make to net a profit, then that series of action will inevitably be done. But one man's gain is another man's loss in a vast majority of cases.\n\nDeSoc could easily leverage DeFi to guide the whole thing towards a positive-sum thing. Imagine this: If more reputation nets you more economic utility in terms of loans, airdrops, exclusive dibs on alpha projects, etc. then there is a strong financial motive to have more reputation to unlock this utility. But since you can't just buy reputation with money, the only way to earn reputation is to do whatever the community decides is worthy of reputation. So now the aforementioned series of actions taken to net a financial profit involves stuff like \"donate to public goods funding\", \"make a valuable contribution to the community\", \"provide $XXX of liquidity to the community treasury for one year\" or literally any of the other infinite as-of-yet unthinkable things a community might decide it wants people to do to earn more reputation.\n\nNow of course there is a lot of balance required, and whatever can be gamified negatively will inevitably be gamified negatively. There's probably a thousands rebuttals about how this will never work because of this or that inherently unsolvable problem. But crypto's history is pretty much a constantly growing list of inherently unsolvable problem being solved. And a lot of the time it's \"ok but that problem was already solved without blockchain\" and it's like yeah, but those solutions don't fit with the core ideals of a neutral permissionless platform enforcing rules agreed-upon by the community, and if you don't get it it's very hard to explain even the basics, before jumping in the even more ridiculously complex rest of it. Eventually they won't *have* to get it to benefit from it, like plenty already are.\n\nAnyway. To beautifully recap this crazed-fuel stream of consciousness of mine, DeSoc might lead to the crypto world ascend to a higher level. Think of what has happened and what might happened next:\n\n* Bitcoin showed that it's possible to enforce digital scarcity, creating assets essentially out of thin air living entirely in the digital realm. Their financial value is pretty much all made up, it's an factor of supply and demand, so these digital assets can definitely have financial value if we all agree they do. \n\n  * PoW is an easy stop gap solution to secure the blockchain with external resources to ensure it's all neutrally controlled by the whole community rather than by one ruling entity. Social consensus is achieved by enough people running the code such that changing it is nearly impossible unless enough people agree to the changes. There is a notion that code dictates what happens, therefore code is law.\n\n* Ethereum goes one step further and showed it's possible to self-manage these digital assets in crazy ways with smart contracts and DeFi, again without a central entity. Things just happen because there's money to be made. Various projects experiment with various token incentives, some are unsustainable and collapse, some are profitable and gain network effects and become a core money lego, etc.\n\n  * The social aspect of it all is also made less sneaky overall. The part of \"unless everyone agrees to change it\" of \"code is law\" is prioritized. Weak subjectivity is a tolerable compromise. Code is written by humans after all.\n\n  * PoS emerges as an alternative, more sustainable way to keep the blockchain neutral and secure by using the native asset as collateral. We all agree that this asset has value, so it has value, and people staking it would rather make more of it by playing by the rules vs. losing it by being baddies\n\n* Enter DeSoc and now the whole \"social\" aspect hidden behind the financial value of digital assets is fully put on display.

Because in the end, the true scarcity was the friends we made along the way.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ok but this DeSoc thing is wrecking my brain to think about. It&#39;s inevitable that it will happen to some degree and we will end up with tokens that have <em>value</em> which can&#39;t be expressed in dollar or ETH terms. </p>\n\n<p>A recent example to illustrate this would be EVMavericks. I recall several people saying things like &quot;You can show that the EVM you hold is the one you minted, so it&#39;s more valuable because you get to prove you&#39;re an OG ethfinancer!&quot;. It&#39;s like, yeah, we ethfinancers internally can agree that there&#39;s value here. Someone who made the whitelist can definitely use their EVM to claim more clout in the community than someone who just bought theirs.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an economic thing with a dollar amount ascribed to it. It&#39;s an internal, social thing emerging from whatever the heck we-the-community decide we do with it. Not a perfect example, but a good illustrative one: I&#39;m more willing to trust you guys and lend someone money if they&#39;re an active part of the community than some rando. Holding an OG EVM is just an agreed-upon way to easily show you are indeed a part of this community with enough clout to have made the whitelist at that specific point in time. So this could plausibly scale to something like ManeNetDAO running a simple dapp providing undercollateralized loans to OG EVM holders and rewarding liquidity providers with interests collected on the loan, with profits flowing back to the DAO. And just like that, your OG EVM has undeniable economic utility that a non-OG EVM doesn&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>There is an added <em>social value</em> to OG EVM&#39;s that can&#39;t be translated into a dollar amount, because obviously the minute you sell that OG EVM, the buyer has 0 claim to the OG status, and the social value disappears. So all the extra utility we-the-community decided OG EVMs have cannot be translated to a dollar figure. <em>But there&#39;s still a social value happening.</em></p>\n\n<p>That is, in my understanding, the underlying principle behind DeSoc. You get a token that&#39;s soulbound to your identity/wallet (or pseudo-identity to preserve IRL identity) and people ascribe value to that token based on reputation rather than dollars. And then way more use-cases can emerge out of blockchain stuff that aren&#39;t necessarily degen and financialized to death in nature. My puny little DeFi degen brain can still only think of undercollateralized loans based on algorithms that value risk/rewards that analyzes your reputation token with its repayment history and other various factors in order to have a fairer credit system leading to infinitely more economic activity and value creation happening on-chain.</p>\n\n<p>But like, go a step further. Don&#39;t you see what&#39;s happening? With DeFi it&#39;s very easy to grasp. If there is a series of actions (i.e. smart contact calls) that one can make to net a profit, then that series of action will inevitably be done. But one man&#39;s gain is another man&#39;s loss in a vast majority of cases.</p>\n\n<p>DeSoc could easily leverage DeFi to guide the whole thing towards a positive-sum thing. Imagine this: If more reputation nets you more economic utility in terms of loans, airdrops, exclusive dibs on alpha projects, etc. then there is a strong financial motive to have more reputation to unlock this utility. But since you can&#39;t just buy reputation with money, the only way to earn reputation is to do whatever the community decides is worthy of reputation. So now the aforementioned series of actions taken to net a financial profit involves stuff like &quot;donate to public goods funding&quot;, &quot;make a valuable contribution to the community&quot;, &quot;provide $XXX of liquidity to the community treasury for one year&quot; or literally any of the other infinite as-of-yet unthinkable things a community might decide it wants people to do to earn more reputation.</p>\n\n<p>Now of course there is a lot of balance required, and whatever can be gamified negatively will inevitably be gamified negatively. There&#39;s probably a thousands rebuttals about how this will never work because of this or that inherently unsolvable problem. But crypto&#39;s history is pretty much a constantly growing list of inherently unsolvable problem being solved. And a lot of the time it&#39;s &quot;ok but that problem was already solved without blockchain&quot; and it&#39;s like yeah, but those solutions don&#39;t fit with the core ideals of a neutral permissionless platform enforcing rules agreed-upon by the community, and if you don&#39;t get it it&#39;s very hard to explain even the basics, before jumping in the even more ridiculously complex rest of it. Eventually they won&#39;t <em>have</em> to get it to benefit from it, like plenty already are.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway. To beautifully recap this crazed-fuel stream of consciousness of mine, DeSoc might lead to the crypto world ascend to a higher level. Think of what has happened and what might happened next:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Bitcoin showed that it&#39;s possible to enforce digital scarcity, creating assets essentially out of thin air living entirely in the digital realm. Their financial value is pretty much all made up, it&#39;s an factor of supply and demand, so these digital assets can definitely have financial value if we all agree they do. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PoW is an easy stop gap solution to secure the blockchain with external resources to ensure it&#39;s all neutrally controlled by the whole community rather than by one ruling entity. Social consensus is achieved by enough people running the code such that changing it is nearly impossible unless enough people agree to the changes. There is a notion that code dictates what happens, therefore code is law.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Ethereum goes one step further and showed it&#39;s possible to self-manage these digital assets in crazy ways with smart contracts and DeFi, again without a central entity. Things just happen because there&#39;s money to be made. Various projects experiment with various token incentives, some are unsustainable and collapse, some are profitable and gain network effects and become a core money lego, etc.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The social aspect of it all is also made less sneaky overall. The part of &quot;unless everyone agrees to change it&quot; of &quot;code is law&quot; is prioritized. Weak subjectivity is a tolerable compromise. Code is written by humans after all.</li>\n<li>PoS emerges as an alternative, more sustainable way to keep the blockchain neutral and secure by using the native asset as collateral. We all agree that this asset has value, so it has value, and people staking it would rather make more of it by playing by the rules vs. losing it by being baddies</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Enter DeSoc and now the whole &quot;social&quot; aspect hidden behind the financial value of digital assets is fully put on display. Things can also have social value if we say they do. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Now reputation in a given community is a natural part of making gains, and reputation is acquirable by doing things deemed positive for all by the community. And doing things the community doesn&#39;t like risks harming your reputation. And it&#39;s not just gonna be a cold, calculated series of action taken to make the most money for the least effort either, since humans also thrive in when they&#39;re recognized and valued by others for doing cool shit.

You would be willing to buy/sell it for $1M (or very close it, perhaps discounting that $1M sitting in the company is a bit less worth to you than that cash sitting in your bank account). Value ~ 1M USD\n\nNow imagine the same company with $1M in its balance sheet but that is also able to generate $1M in yearly cash flows. You would be willing to buy/sell it for more than the first company as it's able to generate cash for you year over year. In fact, you would be willing to buy/sell it for the previous amount plus the present value of its future cash flows using a discount rate you want to apply, as money in the future is a bit less worth than money today. For the sake of the argument let's say your discount rate is 10%. Value ~ 1M + DCF(1M per year @ 10% discount rate)\n\nNow imagine the same company decides that is going to give an extraordinary dividend as it's just accumulating cash and doesn't know what to do with it. It decides to return $ 0.5M in dividends. Immediately the company is worth $500M less as that amount is removed from its balance sheet. Its future cash flows remain untouched though. Value ~ 0.5M + DCF(1M per year @ 10% discount rate)\n\nMarkets are rather efficient at adjusting the share value for these events because they are very easy to model, figuring out there 500M less in the balance sheet is rather trivial. So what happens is that the market capitalization adjusts to reflect this new situation and the stock price falls. As a share holder you are not better or worse after the dividend. Before you had that money in the form of equity, now you have it in the form of cash in your account.\n\nIf a company does not return a dividend, here is a very simple trick you can use to return value to yourself. Sell a bit of the stock. The moral of the story is that returning it as dividends is irrelevant, what matters is generating the cash flow that accrues in its balance sheet. This is known as the irrelevance of dividends theory by Soloman, Modigliani et al. And is correct in the ideal scenario where there are no taxes and makets are perfectly efficient in pricing. In practice, there are taxes which typically hurt more the dividend paying companies as you have to pay taxes on dividends and these are usually higher than capital gain taxes. Markets may also fail to price efficiently the value of a company as some market participants seem to prefer dividends irrationally, the introduction of a dividend payment or boosting an existing dividend may result in a higher valuation.\n\nGoing back to cryptocurrencies, what matters is that the token gives you ownership in some way of the revenues of its use. For that there needs to be revenues to speak of (i.e., users have to pay to use it) and the protocol must give you ownership in some way of those revenues (by giving them to you as a token-holder). Ethereum does both things. Bitcoin does only the first but not the second, as owning Bitcoin does not entitle you to the revenues of the network, they go to miners instead. Other tokens are just governance tokens that do not entitle you to any cash flow and can simply be used to vote on the future evolution of the protocol.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>So what he&#39;s missing I guess is that there are different token strategies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, he is assuming Ethereum operates like Bitcoin which does not return cash flow to its token-holders.

For example I buy 1 ETH at $4,000 but the price drops to $2,000 could I hypothetically convert it to <a href=\"/r/ETH\">r/ETH</a> and right off the $2,000 &quot;loss&quot; in the same ways that I have to claim the gains?
