I've previously been intimidated by Ledger's \"advanced users only\" warning, and would still preach respectful caution in using these, but after messing around with wiping the device, restoring from the seed phrase, and re-entering the various passphrases to confirm the accessed addresses remain the same, I now have rock-solid confidence in the reliability of the process.\n\nFor folks who aren't familiar, there are two flavors of passphrase on the Ledger - the first allows you to durably link a 25th word to your 24-word seed phrase with a new PIN code, such that this secondary PIN will open the Ledger into a shadowy set of secret accounts. This way, you can keep your main stash behind this secret PIN code, and the primary PIN code (corresponding to just the 24-word seed phrase) can be loaded with a small portion of your stack for plausible deniability (enough for a hypothetical wrench-wielder to feel they have gotten an acceptable return on their five-dollar investment). \n\nHowever, if you're like me and you're concerned that upon the first wrench-to-kneecap contact you'd accidentally blurt out the secret secondary PIN (which I would likely set as 12345 for ease-of-blurting), you can use the second, temporary flavor of passphrase. Here, the 25th \"word\" is wiped after you've ended your session, so you'd have to re-enter it anew each time you want to access that particular address. This slows down the access process, particularly if through my snot and tears I'm trying to convey to the wrenchman that the passphrase is [fourwordsalluppercase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLE7zsJk4AI). Better still if I can't even immediately access the passphrase, given that it was derived from page 82 of my childhood diary, stored at my mom's house. \n\n\"Try something about wanting to marry Andrew Connelly, and Timmy Jenkins being a dumb fart-sniffer?\"\n\nIn digging into all this, I've had to shift how I think about seed phrases - it's like the seed phrase is a master key to a giant mansion, and each new address is a room within that mansion. An infinitude of rooms are already accessible if you should have the master key, but unbeknownst to your attacker, there is a near infinitude of secret mansions-within-the-mansion that can only be accessed if you know the corresponding passphrases. It's a fricking cryptographic Gringotts, a Matryoshka Money Mansion, an algorithmic House of Leaves.\n\nAnyways, this framing also has me thinking about scenarios where you have accounts for multiple family members, all linked to a familial seed phrase/Ledger (secured by the familial 12345 PIN), where access to each individual's respective account can be willed to them via their specific passphrase. I need to think through if that actually makes sense, but in the meantime I think I'm gonna start squirreling away some $DBC (Dick Butt Coin) and $FART tokens for my nephews to inherit upon my eventual wrench-induced passing.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I&#39;ve been playing around with the <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/academy/passphrase-an-advanced-security-feature\">passphrase functionality</a> on m&#39;Ledger over the past few days, and I&#39;m finding it quite useful - you can create as many passphrases as you want, and they can be up to 100 alphasymbolonumerical characters long, so they can be made to be damned secure. I&#39;ve previously been intimidated by Ledger&#39;s &quot;advanced users only&quot; warning, and would still preach respectful caution in using these, but after messing around with wiping the device, restoring from the seed phrase, and re-entering the various passphrases to confirm the accessed addresses remain the same, I now have rock-solid confidence in the reliability of the process.</p>\n\n<p>For folks who aren&#39;t familiar, there are two flavors of passphrase on the Ledger - the first allows you to durably link a 25th word to your 24-word seed phrase with a new PIN code, such that this secondary PIN will open the Ledger into a shadowy set of secret accounts. This way, you can keep your main stash behind this secret PIN code, and the primary PIN code (corresponding to just the 24-word seed phrase) can be loaded with a small portion of your stack for plausible deniability (enough for a hypothetical wrench-wielder to feel they have gotten an acceptable return on their five-dollar investment). </p>\n\n<p>However, if you&#39;re like me and you&#39;re concerned that upon the first wrench-to-kneecap contact you&#39;d accidentally blurt out the secret secondary PIN (which I would likely set as 12345 for ease-of-blurting), you can use the second, temporary flavor of passphrase. Here, the 25th &quot;word&quot; is wiped after you&#39;ve ended your session, so you&#39;d have to re-enter it anew each time you want to access that particular address. This slows down the access process, particularly if through my snot and tears I&#39;m trying to convey to the wrenchman that the passphrase is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLE7zsJk4AI\">fourwordsalluppercase</a>. Better still if I can&#39;t even immediately access the passphrase, given that it was derived from page 82 of my childhood diary, stored at my mom&#39;s house. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Try something about wanting to marry Andrew Connelly, and Timmy Jenkins being a dumb fart-sniffer?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In digging into all this, I&#39;ve had to shift how I think about seed phrases - it&#39;s like the seed phrase is a master key to a giant mansion, and each new address is a room within that mansion. An infinitude of rooms are already accessible if you should have the master key, but unbeknownst to your attacker, there is a near infinitude of secret mansions-within-the-mansion that can only be accessed if you know the corresponding passphrases. It&#39;s a fricking cryptographic Gringotts, a Matryoshka Money Mansion, an algorithmic House of Leaves.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, this framing also has me thinking about scenarios where you have accounts for multiple family members, all linked to a familial seed phrase/Ledger (secured by the familial 12345 PIN), where access to each individual&#39;s respective account can be willed to them via their specific passphrase. I need to think through if that actually makes sense, but in the meantime I think I&#39;m gonna start squirreling away some $DBC (Dick Butt Coin) and $FART tokens for my nephews to inherit upon my eventual wrench-induced passing.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-19 14:41:14","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-05-19 18:09:26","id":"i994ero","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_usvsir","parent_id":"t3_usvsir","score":54,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jcbevns","body":"Thanks!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-19 15:10:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i9988vv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_usvsir","parent_id":"t1_i994ero","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/shiftli","body":"Upvoted for execellent mix of education and comedy!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Upvoted for execellent mix of education and comedy!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-19 15:34:23","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"i99b9w7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_usvsir","parent_id":"t1_i994ero","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Kukai_walker","body":"Great post--very practical.

That APR wont be paid in a shit coin. It will be paid in USDC.

Arbitrum will have a large consortium of defi primitives and starkware will be a centralized chain for tradfi. \nI think this will be precipitated by the recent exodus of TVL from alt L1s as people begin to come back to the safety and ubiquity of ETH...subsquently migrating to the L2s. The addition of Nitro to Arbitrum, and a forth coming token launch for the Arbitrum ecosystem position GMX as a premier protocol on chain at the best possible time to take advantage of this l2 growth.\nThe market sucks ass and is likely to get worse before it gets better.

What kind of vampire attack? Without an explanation, this doesn't really make sense and to make claims about a vulnerability it's important to back them up.\n\n>However, the information the oracles provide is available to every minipool operator that runs their own node - the only challenge is ensuring the information is accurate. This is exactly what cryptocurrency and Proof of Stake does; so it seems crazy to pay 15% to solve a trust problem when a trustless solution could be implemented for free. Pricing data can be determined from on chain data based on AMM's with a time weighted median function to defend against flash loan attacks.\n\nThe current design is much simpler.
