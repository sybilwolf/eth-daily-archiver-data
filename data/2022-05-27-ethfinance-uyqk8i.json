You have a better shot of good returns with ETH and other coins that still have a long way to go in their growth and adoption cycle. </p>\n\n<p>If you want an asset that will hold its value (store of value) then an instrument that has lost 50% of its value is not it. BTC is clearly not an inflation hedge either - it rises and sinks like all risk assets link stocks. It remains a risky asset on the far side, built on application of internet technology but peddled by charlatans as a quack pseudo religion. </p>\n\n<p>BTC is propped up by memes of store of value and inflation hedge, most of these are already dismantled but I&#39;d say give it 1-2 more cycles for even the hardcore false narrative peddling maxi to realize it has limited upside and enormous downside, people will drop it like a hot potato.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-27 09:38:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ia7mj20","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uyqk8i","parent_id":"t1_ia7ipf7","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/seblt","body":"Can someone enlighten me on Vitalik's alleged recent implied switch of his attention from Ethereum to Bitcoin?
