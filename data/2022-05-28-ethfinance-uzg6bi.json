On Ethereum, Lido provides the stETH token, this is a staking liquidity token that Lido issues to people who deposit Ether into their system. Lido then contracts with about [20 staking operators] (https://www.rated.network/o/Lido) who stake the Ether and provide rewards to stETH holders. \n\nLido was the first liquid staking protocol to launch, they admittedly launched with a less-than optimal design, they launched as a custodial operator who held user tokens in a multi-sig until the beacon chain implemented a withdrawal to smart contract feature. Lido also onboarded [many high profile investors](https://twitter.com/thiccnoggin/status/1516980784132993024), and executed an effective marketing campaign through Bankless (I don't have a link, but if you've listened to Bankless you've heard the Lido ads). In the mean time, other pooled staking platforms like Rocket Pool and Stakewise have failed to gain significant network traction despite having superior designs (Rocket Pool and Stakewise currently operate less than 2% of the validators together). On the sidelines are Coinbase (14%), Kraken (8%), and Binance (5%).\n\nThe most important feature Lido offered is the liquidity token that allowed adoption into defi. Users on the defi platform Aave are able to increase their exposure to Ether AND gain rewards by leveraging stETH, this essentially means locking up stETH, taking out a loan, and buying more stETH. This is common in defi, but it does lead to increased risk of loss. With the proliferation of stETH on Aave the validator queue quickly became filled with a long line of investors leverage-longing steth, which created artificial demand for stETH and caused the activation queue on the beacon chain to swell to 14 days + (This isn't a problem, it's the design of the activation queue). When Terra/Luna melted down and the markets tumbled, seETH holders needed to unwind their leveraged positions and sell seETH to prevent their positions from being liquidated, this flooded the market with stETH and caused it to fall below the 1 stETH = 1 ETH target (let's not call it a peg because it really isn't programmed goal). stETH is still below this target and according to coingecko you can get 1 stETH for 0.977 Ether.\n\nAll of this activity caused Lido's share of the validators on the beacon chain to [swell to 32%](https://dune.com/hildobby/ETH2-Deposits). It was halted by the Terra/Luna meltdown and has hovered around 32% since. On May 10, Ethereum Researcher and beacon chain organizer Danny Ryan called for Lido to self limit saying, \"[Lido passing 1/3 is a centralization attack on PoS.](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1524044527828303872)\". On [May 2](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1524910788015685654) I tweeted to asking entities to self-limit to operating less than 22% of the validators on the network. I see this as the threshold where the community should speak up and urge entities to act in the best interest of the network. Vitalik Buterin, the original founder of Ethereum, expects even more, [saying](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1525301234516652032) \"\nwe should legitimize price gouging by top stake pool providers. Like, if a stake pool controls > 15%, it should be accepted and even *expected* for the pool to keep increasing its fee rate until it goes back below 15%.\" \n\nAt this point, we're faced with two points of view: One point of view is from the people who have spent years working toward the success of Proof of Stake on Ethereum through the beacon chain, and the other perspective from a company who is making money operating validators. \n\nWhy is there a disagreement? Lido says that they're not a governance entity, they suggest that they could never exert any control over their 20 operators, and that the network will run best when qualified operators run nodes. They regard stEth as a token similar to wEth that doesn't exert any third party governance over the network. Lido might simply describe themselves as a \"label\" for staked Ether, but in fact, they wield real governance authority over their 20 operators: If an operator fails to follow the wishes of Lido they can be excluded from the operator set, and likewise, operators are incentivized to do whatever they need to do to remain a part of Lido and receive payouts. This **REALLY** describes a governance layer. They suggest that they are saving the network from domination by centralized exchanges by offering their services.\n\nEthereans see things differently. The beacon chain was developed for maximum decentralization, that is - validators and nodes spread out all over the world. We believe the network will be most effective when lots of people with lots of skill sets run validators from home, and use trustless, open source, decentralized, and permissionless staking platforms. We believe that the beacon chain will be most successful when many entities and node operators exist on the network. We don't want or seek administration by any third party governance layer who would control more than 33% of validators, no matter how thin it claims to be. In other words, Lido is \"saving\" us from something we never asked to be saved from, against our will.\n\nI want to point out that while I do currently believe Lido is engaged in an attack on the network, I don't view them as a malicious entity. If they cease the attack and align with the network I'll continue to support their participation in a healthy network. If they succeed in achieving more than 33% of the validators, they will have established a precedent where a third party can control the network without any resistance from the rest of the community. With 33% of the validators Lido MIGHT prevent the network from finalizing (while this possibility exists, I don't assume that they would do it). If they DO gain 33% of the validators, things may look fine for awhile, but the real consequence is the loss of credible decentralization on the beacon chain and the failure to gain traction with nation-states and corporations. If nothing is done to prevent governance capture, Ethereum will slowly fade away and hopefully be replaced by something more successful. The threat of an outside entity gaining a large share of the validators always exists, but the role of the community is to resist that, not hand it over to one governor.\n\nIn closing, WE are the only people who can prevent this capture. [The beacon chain can't speak for itself.](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1524049054086438912). If you believe that the future of the Ethereum rests on a decentralized beacon chain, then it's imperative that you arm yourself with information and fight.\n\nThis is the layered approach that is a combination of the three approaches described by Vitalik, Danny, and me (sourced from [eth2.news](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_220520)):\n\n>15% - pools throttle/ stop accepting deposits (\u00e0 la Vitalik)\n\n> 22% - the community will take action (\u00e0 la Superphiz)\n\n> 33% - is an attack and protocol devs engage (\u00e0 la Danny)\n\nA week ago, the [Lido community began a debate](https://research.lido.fi/t/should-lido-on-ethereum-be-limited-to-some-fixed-of-stake/2225) about whether they ought to follow the recommendations of Danny and Vitalik.

ETH is already flowing away from exchanges into DeFi, making it that much more difficult to gather up enough ETH at once.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-28 09:37:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iabulgo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uzg6bi","parent_id":"t1_iabp0co","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/BigglyBillBrasky","body":"Any workarounds, or is this just not possible to patch/prevent besides an attacker destroying their ETH when the chain loses all credibility?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Any workarounds, or is this just not possible to patch/prevent besides an attacker destroying their ETH when the chain loses all credibility?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-05-28 09:00:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iabpvme","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_uzg6bi","parent_id":"t1_iabp0co","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/domotheus","body":"Yeah from my understanding they'd get hit with inactivity penalties and lose part of their stake.

In essence, an unchanged, minority fork of Ethereum. In this classic tragedy, a naive, hopeful being is born into the world - and just as quickly torn apart by the cruel reality of mother nature. (Trigger warning: gore)\n\nThe story begins as our hero, Ethereum, senses an emotional turbulence inside him. As he's about to embark on the train to the promised land of PoS, a small voice inside him rejects that notion. So he removes that voice and places it beside himself, and a new being, *Ethereum PoW*, is born. With that voice removed, our hero Ethereum boards the PoS train and rides off into the sunset, leaving his progeny behind.\n\nNow, remember those Black Mirror episodes where they make an identical copy of a person, and that person has all the same memories, feelings, etc. of the original person? Then, the \"copy\" of the person becomes the main character of the story instead of the \"original\"? That's what happens here. Ethereum PoW is confused at first, because from his own perspective, the Ethereum that rode off on the train is the copy, and he is the original. What he doesn't know yet is that he is missing several vital organs that, due to their nature, were not able to survive the copying process.\n\nThe first thing Ethereum PoW notices is that he is alone at the train station and there are no other trains leaving. It's eerily quiet for a couple minutes - about ten mostly empty blocks. And then Ethereum PoW begins to panic, classic Black Mirror style.\n\nHe prods at his stomach, noticing gaps where several of his organs should be. USDC and USDT are gone completely, now worth zero from one block to the next. His ENS names are no longer honored. His NFTs are mere shadows of their originals. \"I was sure that the copying process would go smoothly,\" Ethereum PoW thinks to himself, \"it went well enough last time, when I created Classic.\" What Ethereum PoW doesn't realize is that as he grew and evolved since last time, third party companies had quietly inserted cybernetic parts inside of him, parts that enhanced him, yet couldn't be properly copied by his natural, biological reproduction process.\n\nEthereum PoW stands still for several seconds, lacking his liver and kidneys, lacking his ears and nose, lacking an immune system, but still ever aware and able to feel pain. He has no mouth, and he must scream.\n\nFirst, the swarm of rats arrives.\n\nThe rats have a taste for MEV, and Ethereum PoW's damaged body is coursing with it. They zero in on his open stomach wounds, and begin to gnaw and chew the remaining organs out of Ethereum PoW's still-very-much-alive body as he falls defenseless to the ground. The rats immediately run to ETHPoW-Uniswap to trade ETHPoW-USDC, ETHPoW-USDT, and other now-unbacked ETHPoW stablecoins for ETHPoW-ETH. The ETH price oracles are also malfunctioning in our antihero's tummy - if they're even still there, they return the price of ETH on the incorrect majority chain due to replay attacks. Otherwise they are gone altogether, causing DeFi to freeze or undergo cascading liquidations. As the rats tear ETHPoW-USDC out of Ethereum PoW's stomach, ETHPoW-DAI trails along, tugged onto the ground to be fed on by the rats. If the ETH price oracles correct quickly enough to reflect ETHPoW-ETH's true price, our antihero may be able to hold on to his Aave and Compound for a few more precious moments while the rats trigger liquidations from all angles; if not, they get dragged entirely out of the body like the other organs.\n\nAs his innards are being devoured, Ethereum PoW's vital signs spike to unimaginable levels from the systemic shock. Gas prices rise to tens of thousands of gwei and stay elevated for several days to weeks. Block times slow down at first due to the death of most of his hashrate, but then begin to accelerate as the MEV feeding frenzy ramps up faster than his body can compensate. Every $100,000 worth of MEV extracted by a rat is costing that rat $98,000 in gas fees, as Ethereum PoW's temperature runs red-hot.\n\nThen, the swarm of birds arrives.\n\nBeing opportunistic predators, they try to feed not just on Ethereum PoW himself, but also on the swarm of rats that is trying to feed on him. Running their mining rigs at full capacity, the birds rake in massive amounts of ETHPoW-ETH from all the transaction fees being generated by the rats, as well as picking directly at the corpse themselves. But that's not all. As the rats try to run off with bits of Ethereum PoW's entrails, the birds dive-bomb them, reverting their transactions dozens or even hundreds of blocks at a time in an attempt to steal the MEV back from the rats. Some of the smarter rats write custom contracts to try to conceal their MEV and make off with it covertly, but the birds are too smart to be fooled by that.\n\nAs the birds repeatedly fly up and dive-bomb, the EIP-1559 basefee and network hashrate fluctuate wildly. Meanwhile, the bird feeder that someone left out at the train station to placate the birds, called \"issuance\", is being completely ignored. The birds' attention is laser-focused on ripping Ethereum PoW to shreds.\n\nAfter several weeks of feeding, there is no more MEV to be had. Ethereum PoW's corpse is completely picked over. What remains, at least for now, is a thriving bacterial community. Time will tell whether that community evolves into an entirely new organism, or dies out in the harsh desert air. If it dies, its lifeless body will be occasionally propped up for photos, *Weekend At Bernie's* style, by Twitter influencers trying to extract the last remaining juice from the corpse through pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nPerhaps one day, eons in the future, a new train will be built.

In reality that trading stack is something I just try to grow instead of generate fiat. I am super grateful I am in a place to be able to purchase ETH and participate in the ecosystem. EV Mavericks was cool and I haven't sold yet. Rocketpool (RPL) is my jam and I will hang on as long as I can. We are not yet in a place to expand mainstream in the west or to the less fortunate in emerging economies.\n\n\nSomeone in the daily yesterday or maybe two days ago asked what you would do if the merge didn't happen and Ethereum failed -- in such event, I too would leave the cryptocurrency space. I don't believe that will happen because of what I have read, analyzed, and studied about this entire space. My apologies for not being the most technical-minded but my meager contribution to this subreddit is that this area of technological process reminds me of the internet during the mid through late 90s. I was too young back then but if you can grab a hold of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you will make a decent amount of money. Money is good and that's why we all work, right? Money is what makes the world go round.\n\n\nThe thing is ... you won't sell ETH for money. It's worth a lot more. Hold on, friends. Even if this ETH thing doesn't work out you should believe in yourself. The world is ending but you are still alive and able to do good\n\n*Edit: I am rambling but I hope whoever reads this has a good day. We are all trying our best. Even if that best isn't good enough.

Love across the tubes/interweb/connectionwefindhere","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I had hoped for a $10k ETH by now but alas will likely have to wait longer. Since the peak have suffered life changing &quot;paper&quot; losses but bought some more today which I am adding to my trading stack. In reality that trading stack is something I just try to grow instead of generate fiat. I am super grateful I am in a place to be able to purchase ETH and participate in the ecosystem. EV Mavericks was cool and I haven&#39;t sold yet. Rocketpool (RPL) is my jam and I will hang on as long as I can. We are not yet in a place to expand mainstream in the west or to the less fortunate in emerging economies.</p>\n\n<p>Someone in the daily yesterday or maybe two days ago asked what you would do if the merge didn&#39;t happen and Ethereum failed -- in such event, I too would leave the cryptocurrency space. I don&#39;t believe that will happen because of what I have read, analyzed, and studied about this entire space. My apologies for not being the most technical-minded but my meager contribution to this subreddit is that this area of technological process reminds me of the internet during the mid through late 90s. I was too young back then but if you can grab a hold of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you will make a decent amount of money. Money is good and that&#39;s why we all work, right? Money is what makes the world go round.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is ... you won&#39;t sell ETH for money. It&#39;s worth a lot more. Hold on, friends. Even if this ETH thing doesn&#39;t work out you should believe in yourself.

I\u2019m literally just saying it might not be over yet and to prepare for all scenarios. To look around you and see the reality of the situation. The things I listed off,  Those are some examples of the history and facts I keep in mind.

You just seemed to feel like attacking and insulting my mental faculty\u2019s because I\u2019m not (currently)  a hyper bull like you. And yet we both have the same approach.

It\u2019s just this one sided  argument with this idea you have of me in your head which doesn\u2019t even exist.

To plan for both scenarios and not just up only.This mentality of just attacking anyone who isn\u2019t currently bullish will get us no where \n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019m saying, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever been saying. And I\u2019m not your enemy, I\u2019m not against you. You advocating dca in your argument against me is hilarious considering that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing.

My guess is you won\u2019t even reply to me after this because you will realize you weren\u2019t even arguing with me, but with the demons in your head so to speak.

BecAuse this market is clearly getting to your head","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u201cHow do you know\u201d </p>\n\n<p>How do YOU know friend? I could ask you the same thing. My whole point is no one knows but it\u2019s obvious what is more likely</p>\n\n<p>I said thoughts are based on history and facts , and I said this because of the way you tried to portray me in the way you did in your first snarky comment to me.all I was saying is there a lot of stuff out there to gauge where the market may be trending in response to claiming I\u2019m some sort of example of  market psychology. I\u2019m literally just saying it might not be over yet and to prepare for all scenarios. To look around you and see the reality of the situation. The things I listed off,  Those are some examples of the history and facts I keep in mind. I never once mentioned statistical analysis, or that I know for sure what\u2019s gonna happen, but it\u2019s quite obvious what the current trend is. </p>\n\n<p>\u201c less than five percent beat Dca\u201d bro you realize ( I have made it clear in this thread)  I am dcaing into this market currently , have never sold any of my ETH and am continuing to buy? So my question is what are you even talking about, and why are we even arguing. You just seemed to feel like attacking and insulting my mental faculty\u2019s because I\u2019m not (currently)  a hyper bull like you. And yet we both have the same approach. Expect nothing, and Dca. </p>\n\n<p>Literally all I\u2019m advocating for is a little restraint and to plan for all scenarios and here you are treating me like I\u2019m some bear who has not only  punched your grandmother in the mouth but who  also says it\u2019s all over and That I\u2019m waiting to buy at 324. Guess what? I am not. I am on your side. So when you attack me like you are, over things that aren\u2019t even the case, it becomes tiresome and and a waste of time</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s clear to me you just want to bash me because I\u2019m not currently bullish. And yet I still continue to buy, believe and ethereum and have never sold. I don\u2019t know why you think I do but let me make it clear I have no interest in timing the market </p>\n\n<p>I think you need to step down off your high horse, take a deep breath, go outside and touch grass .because I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s me your railing against, it\u2019s just you dumping on me to make yourself feel better about your decisions and position without taking into account anything I even say lol. It\u2019s just this one sided  argument with this idea you have of me in your head which doesn\u2019t even exist.
