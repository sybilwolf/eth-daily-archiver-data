Warning, what follows is a long rant on solving a specific tragedy of the commons problem that you may or may not care about. I chose overfishing here but the principles of design apply to most tragedy of the commons problems.\n\nCoordinating needs to be strictly rational as both as individual and group. Purely benevolent opt-in solutions that leave selfish actors free to benefit from harmful behavior will never meet this criteria. To convince otherwise disinclined participants join the network the network must be able to inflict economic harm that outweighs the economic benefits of selfish behavior. Each participant is at liberty to do as they wish but they must not benefit from the harm they cause and they should benefit more from joining the network. This is the qualitative baseline for an incentive aligned system for coordination.\n\nAs a concrete example consider the classic case of overfishing. The actors here are the individual fishing ships, the ports that service them, and the nations that can govern the laws the ports must abide by. At a nation state level, each nation wants a vibrant marine ecosystem providing food for their citizens. At an individual level, each fisherman wants to maximize his haul. However, no one wants to constrain their activities just so others can exploit the ecosystem. The more participants you add to this network, the harder the trust problem becomes. This is akin to the difficulty of keeping a secret within a large group. \"Two people can keep a secret if one of them is dead\". In the long run this discoordination lowers the future yields for everyone. At the extreme, the marine ecosystem collapses and there is no more fishing outside of fish farms which are far more costly per calorie than fish extracted from a vibrant marine ecosystem.\n\nIt's not possible for one nation to pass a law governing another nation's ports nor to enforce their policies militarily. Therefore each nation is free to make it's own choice about policies regarding overfishing. Naturally, this leads to diverse outcomes. When free to choose however they want inevitably some nations will choose to allow overfishing despite knowing the long-term consequences. So how can we align the incentives of these participants to produce a system that incentivizes coordination?\n\nPorts are subject to the laws of a nation, the use of ports is required to extract economic value from fishing, and there are far fewer of them as an enforcement point than fishing ships. This makes ports the ideal enforcement point for a network that wishes to prevent overfishing. So, we create a network of ports, a fishing permit system, an oracle of the cargo loaded to and from each port, and a billing system all money for port services passes through. If a port allows fishing ships to unload tons that are not in accordance with the fishing permit system this can be detected and the network can respond to it. I'm going to hand-wave the technical challenges and focus on the game-theory here.\n\nTo start with, what do we do about ports and ships that are off network and aren't coordinating? Well, a satellite system can track which vessels are docking at each port and an oracle can write data about that to the cargo tracking contract using pessimistic assumptions based on the cargo capacity of the vessel. This data will be source of penalties upon them. At least integrating with the cargo oracle system in the port's best interests as it can only reduce their costs. With that in place, what should the system do if an overfishing event is detected (cargo > permitted)? Qualitatively we know that the fisherman should not benefit from this. However, if the port is not coordinating with the billing system we need a mechanism to penalize the port since at that point there is no direct system to penalize the fisherman.\n\nIn this case, the coordinating ports need to *do something* to the uncooperative one. Without a unified billing system, the only thing in their control is their own port. So they will need to apply penalties on ships that visit their port after docking at an uncooperative port. This could take the form of tariffs, higher fees on services such as docking, maintenance, refueling, etc. These penalties are **economic coercion**. They are only possible/meaningful because of a web of trade and services that ports facilitate and which the individual ships require. They are the leverage by which uncooperative ports are held to account. As a producer, if you don't want your items subject to higher logistics fees and tariffs, direct your logistics network solely through cooperative ports.\n\nThese measures hurt the cooperating ports and nations, sure, but overfishing does as well on longer time horizons. The key is to apply economic penalties that exceed than the economic benefits of short-sighted greed. So while Japan might not be inclined to stop whale fishing otherwise, pressure applied by their automobile export industry due to the hit on their profit margins could force an uncooperative port to instead join the network. This makes overfishing *their problem.* Note, this doesn\u2019t require the defecting nation or port to comply with this, it can be entirely enforced by cooperative ports.\n\nThe remaining case where you have an overfishing event on a coordinating port is trivial because the penalties can be applied to the offending fishing vessel at the point of unloading. The port doesn't even have discretion in this because the billing system is controlled by the smart contract. This is much simpler.\n\nThis changes everything. It creates a *flywheel* of coordination. Once it reaches a tipping point each participant creates more and more economic pressure on defecting ports to join the network because there are fewer places they can export to or that their ships can visit without penalty. Further, the penalties can be socialized amongst a larger set of ports while applying the same harm to defectors. Every port that joins the makes the coordination incentive more economical to apply and once the tipping point is reached the network is self-propelling. The hard part is getting a critical mass of ports/nations to bootstrap the network at or past this tipping point in scale.\n\nAny port can choose to leave the network at any time but the result would be similar to Brexit economically. There is a rational, sticky incentive system that pushes ports to join the network and stay there. There will always be the North Koreas of the world who choose to go it alone but look where they end up. Humanity is stronger *together* and the more isolated network you create the poorer you will be.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Follow up on my previous post about <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/uug2ve/daily_general_discussion_may_21_2022/i9f4q1c/\">human coordination</a>.

And ontop of that I really like what optimism is trying to do. </p>\n\n<p>How I would define activity ? Well if you delegate your OP and maybe you also use the soulbound tokens to vote. Or maybe change from one delegate to the other (a sign that you actually pay attention) next round could get a boost of 2x the tokens compared to a regular user.  </p>\n\n<p>I mean the goal of optimism is to give people that have interest in the governance a bigger voice.  They are probably trying to figure out how to get more people involved in governance.</p>\n\n<p>And it would make sense to incentivize participation.</p>\n\n<p>Also I doubt its tied to the token that you got airdropped. If you rebuy at a lower price and then delegate they will also see that you have genuine interest. And again users will be rewarded too LPs etc. </p>\n\n<p>The optimism team was on bankless after they announced the token and they said they will reward behaviour that they want to see. I doubt anyone gets excluded but just not rewarded equally.</p>\n\n<p>It kinda makes sense to structure your airdrop like that dont you think ? I think future airdrops will all be like this. I think Lyra airdropped tokens based on the amount of times you posted on discord and which subcategories you posted in.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-01 09:52:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iat0hha","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_v293qs","parent_id":"t1_iasvhgd","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"couldn't they just give people who didn't sell a bonus instead of harshly disqualifying people completely and risking them ever wanting to participate in the ecosystem again?
