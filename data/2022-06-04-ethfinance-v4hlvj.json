First of all though, I must say that I'm as excited and bullish on the merge as anybody else in here!\n\nThe key point that got me thinking about this, and that I'll be building upon, is the fact that miners have less and less future revenue at stake the closer to to the merge we come. At the same time they have invested into valuable computational resources, that more or less will become obsolete (within the implementation of Ethereum, that is, but not other chains). This could, in terms of game theory, allow for some incentives that doesn't align with a healthy state of the ecosystem. \n\nMiners, in having the power of being block-producers, have had a wide range of possible strategies to extract value by reordering the transactions in a block, known as MEV. Although it's possible to consider all of this as malicious to the ecosystem (which is not the point I'll be making here), some of these are considerably more harmful and damaging to the users and decentralized systems as a whole, than others. An example of this is reorg-attacks, or \"time bandit\" attacks, where a set of the n latest blocks are reorganized and accepted as part of the main chain. \n\nThe first time I saw an attack like this being executed, was with Etheroll some years ago, where someone leveraged the opportunity to utilize chain reorgs to place winning bets on the application. It's a highly sophisticated attack-vector, but my impression is that it's more commonly known now, and many people within the space speculates that there has been more value extracted this way, than what is officially known, or open to the public. One of the developers from the \"MEV Geth\" software that miners are famously running to democratize the market for extracting value, even started writing a specialized software to allow miners to easily extract value across multiple blocks with creating more reorgs. This, of course, created a lot of controversy, which over time (as far as I've understood it) lead to him discontinuing pursuing this project. The main point is that this is possible due to the architecture of the current Ethereum implementation, and therefore also probably exploited to some degree already. But doing bigger reorgs frequently in ways that are harming users, doesn't align with the incentives of miners, because it could quickly be an existential threat to Ethereum and DeFi, thus discourage users from using the applications and ultimately reduce the value of the blockchain. And because of this, miners shoot themselves in the foot and miss out on a lot of future revenue.\n\nSo, to go back to the initial point. My impression is that we could consider this last incentive to be less relevant now with the merge coming closer, opening up the possibility of harmful strategies like this to be executed, with less downside down the road for miners. On top of this, their hardware will likely be redirected towards other chains. I could even go as far as saying that this itself could be an incentive to act malicious towards Ethereum, to create drama which again could fuel campaigns to make users choose another chain and moving more value over there.\n\nI'm not too concerned about this though, considering the amount of extremely smart people working in this space with overall incentives aligned with a healthy state of the blockchain future. But it's nonetheless an interesting discussion, that I haven't thought so much about myself. And btw sorry about the wall of text, this rant became much longer than I anticipated.

A Native Hawaiian, he was born to a minor noble family less than three years before the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. He lived to see the territory's admission as a state, and became a United States citizen. He was a five-time Olympic medalist in swimming, winning medals in 1912, 1920 and 1924.\n\nGrowing up on the outskirts of Waikiki, Kahanamoku spent much of his youth at the beach, where he developed his surfing and swimming skills. In his youth, Kahanamoku preferred a traditional surf board, which he called his \"papa nui,\" constructed after the fashion of ancient Hawaiian olo boards. Made from the wood of a koa tree, it was 16 feet (4.9 meters) long and weighed 114 pounds (52 kilograms). The board was without a skeg, which had yet to be invented. In his later surfing career, he would often use smaller boards but always preferred those made of wood.\r  \n\r  \nKahanamoku was also a powerful swimmer. On August 11, 1911, Kahanamoku was timed at 55.4 seconds in the 100 yards (91 meters) freestyle, beating the existing world record by 4.6 seconds, in the salt water of Honolulu Harbor. He also broke the record in the 220 yards (200 meters) and equaled it in the 50 yards (46 meters). But the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), in disbelief, would not recognize these feats until many years later. The AAU initially claimed that the judges must have been using alarm clocks rather than stopwatches and later claimed that ocean currents aided Kahanamoku.\n\nKahanamoku easily qualified for the U.S. Olympic swimming team in 1912. At the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, he won a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle, and a silver medal with the second-place U.S. team in the men's 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay.\r  \n\r  \nDuring the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Kahanamoku won gold medals in both the 100 meters (bettering fellow Hawaiian Pua Kealoha) and in the relay. He finished the 100 meters with a silver medal during the 1924 Olympics in Paris. \n\nBetween Olympic competitions, and after retiring from the Olympics, Kahanamoku traveled internationally to give swimming exhibitions. It was during this period that he popularized the sport of surfing, previously known only in Hawaii, by incorporating surfing exhibitions into his touring exhibitions as well. He attracted people to surfing in mainland America first in 1912 while in Southern California.\r  \n\r  \nHis surfing exhibition at Sydney, Australia's Freshwater Beach on December 24, 1914, is widely regarded as a seminal event in the development of surfing in Australia. The board that Kahanamoku built from a piece of pine from a local hardware store is retained by the Freshwater Surf Club.\r  \n\r  \nDuring his time living in Southern California, Kahanamoku performed in Hollywood as a background actor and a character actor in several films. He made connections in this way with people who could further publicize the sport of surfing. Kahanamoku was involved with the Los Angeles Athletic Club, acting as a lifeguard and competing in both swimming and water polo teams.\r  \n\r  \nWhile living in Newport Beach, California, on June 14, 1925, Kahanamoku rescued eight men from a fishing vessel that capsized in heavy surf while it was attempting to enter the city's harbor. Using his surfboard, Kahanamoku made repeated trips from shore to the capsized ship, and helped rescue several people. Two other surfers saved four more fishermen, while five succumbed to the seas before they could be rescued. At the time the Newport Beach police chief called Kahanamoku's efforts \"The most superhuman surfboard rescue act the world has ever seen.\" It also led to lifeguards across the U.S. to begin using surfboards as standard equipment for water rescues.\n\nLater Kahanamoku was elected to serve as the Sheriff of Honolulu, Hawaii from 1932 to 1961, completing 13 consecutive terms. Today you can find a statue of him just off Waikiki Beach near Uluniu Avenue.\n\nFrom Wikipedia.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>-- 13 days to Hodlercon --</p>\n\n<p>Duke Kahanamoku was a competition swimmer who popularized the sport of surfing and is a legendary Hawaiian.

If the price of ETH goes down (because of speculation/volatility/traders/macro/whatever) but DeFi and all the other blockchain use-cases on layers see roughly the same amount of usage, then ETH is undervalued, more gets burned, the scarcity drives the eventually price back up to a point where everything is secure and sustainable (and similarly, when ETH is overvalued we get less burned and more printed and the price eventually falls back to where it's \"supposed to be\"). There's also an argument to be made that at a given price point and fraction of supply staked, Ethereum can safely secure virtually infinite value, and after that there's really no need to keep pushing those variables up\n\nOf course in the real world it's never as simple as clean variables and simplified models, and right now variables (1) and (2) are uncomfortably correlated given that a big driver of DeFi demand is people leveraging big price swings and trying to extract as much value as possible during bull markets and the latest hyped thing, and a lot of it dies down when price crashes and people pull out. A price-driven death spiral is definitely not out of the question in today's world, but in a hypothetical future world (that I hope to see) where L2s, L3s and more abstractions make way for non-financial use-cases enjoying ultra-cheap ultra-fast transactions at mass scale, then we pretty much reached \"escaped velocity\" and Ether just becomes a thing in the background and the use-cases continue chugging along even if (1) drops, and then (2)+(3) are enough to get it back up and keep everything secure and sustainable.\n\n>How does this sort of design fare when the variables are negative and how does it avoid a death spiral like Terra?\n\nAll blockchains with an unsustainable model risk going the way of Terra, but that death spiral was *brutal* and way too fast. A lot of economic models of smart contract blockchains boil down to \"print 10% of supply/year to pay for security, collect 0.1% of supply in fees/year\" and they're mostly set up in such a way that they can't even adapt properly anywhere close to Ethereum's demand, so they have very little odds of \"making it\" as a high-demand sustainable blockchain. So of course there's an inflationary death spiral in the brewing that shows itself when price goes down, but the chain is more likely to die a social death first before of a technical death. Luna's difference was that there was still economic stuff on the non-UST dapps and bridges worth attacking while Luna's price went to $0 so that's why they had to halt the chain suddenly. \n\nIn the case of ETH tho, those feedback loops really are magical. If the price of ETH suddenly fell to $1 but demand stays the same, then rollups/people/institutions/whale who were previously paying $10M/day on blockspace are still willing to pay that much, but now $10M is way more ETH getting burned every day than today's ~4k ETH (not 10M ETH/day tho lol, protocol revenue in USD will also have to go down if we're talking this extreme of a price dump)\n\nThey're willing to pay way more gwei for blockspace since it's cheaper in USD, but also they get to acquire super cheap ETH in preparation for when the price self-corrects so that when they go back to burning 4k ETH/day, it's done with a more cost efficient basis so stuff on rollups gets to be more competitive with their fees when charging their users in other tokens like stablecoin. They can also easily stake their idle ETH in the meantime! Or maybe their confidence in ETH's price is shot and they only buy as much as they need to pay the eip1559 basefee today, but the end result is still that demand for Ethereum blockspace = demand for Ether, there's no way around it.\n\nOn the staking side, it'll still take a while for honest-but-still-profit-seeking stakers to pull out millions of ETH to cash out and leave altogether, and for evil stakers to deposit millions of ETH bought at $1. And stakers pulling out just drives the APR higher to encourage other people to come in and get a big slice of that pie with 10, 15, maybe 20% APR denominated in ETH. And if I'm an ETH bull I'm gonna buy and stake a shitton of ETH at $1 to get advantage of that staking vacuum and turn that 15% APR into way more when denominated in fiat after the price goes back up.\n\nAgain that's all assuming that demand stays high enough, which is definitely not a given today and will take a while for Ethereum to be ubiquitous enough to always assume an unchangingly high demand, but the point is that given demand for blockspace, the game theory is always aligned such that your best move is to buy and stake ETH.
