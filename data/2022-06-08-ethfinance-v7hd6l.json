I saw there that I was connected to the Arbitrum network and my ETH balance matched what I had swapped over from L1 > L2. Using Uniswap, I see that I can swap ~0.00206 ETH for ~3.69 (giggity) DAI at a cost of $0.91. N.B., that fee changes negligibly when increasing the swap amount by an order of magnitude. Going for it!

Also, yay Ropsten merge! \u2014\n\nWar Week continues with Medal of Honor recipient, eponym of Honolulu's airport and U.S. senator for almost 50 years, Daniel Inouye. (I'm focusing on his military service, not his long and influential political career in Hawaii and Washington.) From Wikipedia:\n\nInouye joined the U.S. Army's segregated 442nd Infantry Regiment, formed of 12,000 second-generation American soldiers of Japanese ancestry (Nisei), with 2,686 from Hawaii and 1,500 directly from Japanese American internment camps. The regiment, which fought in Europe, was the most decorated in U.S. military history and its motto was \"Go for Broke.\"\n\nOn April 21, 1945, Lt. Inouye was grievously wounded while leading an assault on a heavily defended ridge in Liguria, Italy, called the Colle Musatello. As he led his platoon in a flanking maneuver, three German machine guns opened fire from covered positions only 40 yards away, pinning his men to the ground. Inouye stood up to attack and was shot in the stomach. Ignoring his wound, he proceeded to attack and destroy the first machine gun nest with hand grenades and his Thompson submachine gun. When informed of the severity of his wound, he refused treatment and rallied his men for an attack on the second machine gun position, which he successfully destroyed before collapsing to the ground from blood loss.\r  \n\r  \nAs his squad distracted the third machine gunner, Inouye crawled toward the final bunker, coming within 10 yards. As he raised himself on his left elbow and cocked his right arm to throw his last hand grenade, a German soldier saw Inouye and fired a 30 mm Schiessbecher antipersonnel rifle grenade at him from inside the bunker. It struck Inouye directly on his right elbow. The high explosive grenade failed to detonate, saving Inouye from instant death but amputating most of his right arm at the elbow (except for a few tendons and a flap of skin) via blunt force trauma.\n\nDespite this gruesome injury, Inouye was again saved from likely death due to the blunt, low-velocity grenade tearing the nerves in his arm unevenly and incompletely. This involuntarily squeezed the grenade tightly via a reflex arc instead of causing his hand to go limp and drop a live grenade at Inouye's feet. However, this still left him crippled, in terrible pain, under fire with minimal cover and staring at a live grenade \"clenched in a fist that suddenly didn't belong to me anymore.\"\r  \n\r  \nInouye's horrified soldiers moved to his aid, but he shouted for them to keep back out of fear his severed fist would involuntarily relax and drop the grenade. As the German inside the bunker began hastily reloading his rifle with regular full metal jacket ammunition (replacing the wood-tipped rounds used to propel rifle grenades), Inouye quickly pried the live hand grenade from his useless right hand and transferred it to his left. The German soldier had just finished reloading and was aiming his rifle to finish him off when Inouye threw his grenade through the narrow firing slit, killing the German.\n\nStumbling to his feet with the remnants of his right arm hanging grotesquely at his side and his Thompson in his left hand, braced against his hip, Inouye continued forward, killing at least one more German before suffering his fifth and final wound of the day in his left leg. This finally halted his one-man assault for good, and sent him tumbling unconscious to the bottom of the ridge. He awoke to see the worried men of his platoon hovering over him. His only comment before being carried away was to gruffly order them back to their positions, saying \"Nobody called off the war!\"\r  \n\r  \nThe remainder of Inouye's mutilated right arm was later amputated at a field hospital without proper anesthesia, as he had been given too much morphine at an aid station and it was feared any more would lower his blood pressure enough to kill him. Although Inouye had lost his right arm, he remained in the military until 1947 and was honorably discharged with the rank of captain. At the time Inouye left the Army, he was a recipient of the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart. Inouye was initially awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his bravery in this action, with the award later being upgraded to the Medal of Honor by President Bill Clinton (alongside 19 other Nisei servicemen who served in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and had been denied proper recognition of their bravery due to their race). He went on to serve as Hawaii's first full member of the U.S. House of Representatives upon its statehood and and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1963.\n\nA three-minute video of Inouye recounting his charge: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuKkoONhZi0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuKkoONhZi0)\n\nAnd a broader hourlong interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCHQK2SHUsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCHQK2SHUsA).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\u2014 Nine days until Hodlercon.

As we communicated the wallet address to the Optimism team, we made a serious error. We had a Gnosis safe deployed on mainnet for a while and due to an internal mistake, we\u2019ve communicated the very same wallet as the receiving address. As some of you may know, this is not a smart thing to do - having control over mainnet Safe doesn\u2019t guarantee control on other EVM compatible chains (unlike ordinary wallets).\n\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/message-to-optimism-community-from-wintermute/2595\n\nOf course the other possibility is an insider attack. Don't trust anyone in this space.\n\n>We notified the Optimism team on the 30th of May. Since the launch next day was a clear priority we agreed on receiving additional 20 million tokens (providing $50 million USDC as collateral), all while exploring ways to retrieve the funds. At the same time we got in contact with the Gnosis Safe team, asking them for assistance with retrieving the funds. After consulting with the Optimism and Safe teams, Wintermute made the assessment that the funds were potentially retrievable, and that nobody other than Wintermute could recover those funds.
