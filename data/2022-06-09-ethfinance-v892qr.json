PE is generally a measure of how long it would take for the revenue of something to buy all of something at current prices. As a neutral metric it allows me to prioritize investments amongst things I'm excited about. However, as a metric it assumes 100% of something is for sale at the current price. All the ve stuff Defi does manipulates the amount of something for sale. So the market cap and circulating supply of something like CRV is misleading.\n\nI actually calculate PE for 2 reasons.\n\n1) Calculating revenue and costs the way I do tells me about the fundamental **flows** of the token.\n\n2) Calculating market cap tells me about the **liquidity depth** of the token.\n\nIn the case of veTokens like CRV, so much of it is locked up in Convex or otherwise that it literally can't be sold and ought to not be included in the market cap of a PE calculation. In the case of BNT, BNT is created every time the TVL grows but that BNT isn't issuance in the sense that it can't be sold. However, it still acts as resistance to price movement. So while all the BNT should be used for the P in PE, issuance of that form isn't a cost applicable to the E in PE.\n\nDrawing an analogy from physics the P is equivalent to **mass** while E is equivalent to **force**. Bancor v3, if highly successful, will bloat the **mass** of BNT dramatically but the force per mass may actually go down since they mostly are targeting the long tail of tokens with less volume/liquidity. This may mean that the more successful Bancor v3 is at their agenda, the less attractive a BNT purchase/hold is.\n\nFurther BNT is actually several things all balled up into one token which makes it complicated:\n\n1) A governance token with a steady stream of votes for BNT issuance, so it's an LDR token like CRV, CVX, etc but there's been no attempt to make a bribe market for it so this aspect hasn't been monetized.\n\n2) It collects value directly from trading volume. It's kind of like a buyback but not really. This is comparable to Sushi but the mechanism for that profit is very different.\n\n3) An insurance backstop. If you hold BNT you are exposed to the IL of everyone's token. This is similar to holding AAVE. If you hold an insurance backstop token even if you aren't holding stkAAVE you are going to feel the price crash when that insurance backstop token is used.\n\nI'm plenty excited about Bancor v3 the platform. bnTokens have potential to serve as a new form of governance tokens that replace Pool-2 emission expenses for DAOs. Bancor v3 is following a new trend of attaining capital efficiency by deploying idle assets in Defi rather than compressed liquidity ranges that amplify IL for LPs. Bancor v3 slowly acquires PCA which has been a growing trend since the start of Defi 2.0 with things like cvxCRV, the coming accAssets on Tokemak, Alchemix's Transmuter/AMO, etc. So while I like the platform, I'm having a hard time being excited as a buyer.\n\nPoke: /u/lifesmage","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So, there&#39;s something that&#39;s been on my mind as I&#39;ve been occasionally grappling with trying to figure out BNT tokenomics.

I\u2019ve seen some estimates come down recently but this is a solid base for price regardless.\n\nHere is my estimation: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum/\n\nYou can find it in the spreadsheet. You need to change the network revenues to the current ones or your estimation of future revenues.\n\nThe key idea and the math behind it are rather simple. Users of the network pay fees, these fees are best understood as valued in USD*. Fees are split in base_fee and tip. The base_fee is burnt. The tip goes to stakers. With this you can calculate the yields (ETH has 2 yields, one for stakers and one for non-stakers) as follows:\n\n- The burnt ETH results in an effective yield to every ETH-holder, stakers and non-stakers.\n- The tips result in a yield to stakers.\n- The issuance goes to stakers, so it's a yield for them. \n- On the other hand issuance dilutes non-stakers so it's a negative yield for them. In total, issuance is not a yield for the network, it's just a redistribution of capital between stakers and non-stakers.\n\n*Rationale: Most of the fees are burnt (over 80%), which means that for the network to observe the fee revenues over an extended period of time there must be a constant acquisition of ETH by the users to replace the burnt ETH. This means that the fees are worth to the users X amount of dollars (whatever it costed them to acquire the ETH) and hence their willingness to spend them is also priced in dollars. If you disagree with this assumption then you can price them in ETH but I would caution against doing this as this implies that transaction fees are not price-sensitive and users would be willing to pay higher and higher amounts for a transaction if the price of ETH goes up. Which is another way of seeing why fundamentally transaction fees must be priced in USD terms.\n\n>  Ironically I think withdrawals opening could increase price because it reduces a lot of uncertainty and gives clarity and control to large institutions (e.g. Cloudflare) that want to get more involved in staking but have investors to keep top of mind. \n\nI think so too, in the long term, as it de-risks staking.\n\n> Most of my disbelief in the narrative also stems from there being few \u201cintracrypto\u201d applications that are truly innovative (Maker, Uniswap, Curve though not really anymore because of UNI V3 , ENS, Lido though they\u2019re problematic in the interim , OpenSea).

I\u2019ve seen some estimates come down recently but this is a solid base for price regardless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is my estimation: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rnsk2r/fundamental_valuation_models_of_ethereum/</a></p>\n\n<p>You can find it in the spreadsheet. You need to change the network revenues to the current ones or your estimation of future revenues.</p>\n\n<p>The key idea and the math behind it are rather simple. Users of the network pay fees, these fees are best understood as valued in USD*. Fees are split in base_fee and tip. The base_fee is burnt. The tip goes to stakers. With this you can calculate the yields (ETH has 2 yields, one for stakers and one for non-stakers) as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The burnt ETH results in an effective yield to every ETH-holder, stakers and non-stakers.</li>\n<li>The tips result in a yield to stakers.</li>\n<li>The issuance goes to stakers, so it&#39;s a yield for them. </li>\n<li>On the other hand issuance dilutes non-stakers so it&#39;s a negative yield for them. In total, issuance is not a yield for the network, it&#39;s just a redistribution of capital between stakers and non-stakers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*Rationale: Most of the fees are burnt (over 80%), which means that for the network to observe the fee revenues over an extended period of time there must be a constant acquisition of ETH by the users to replace the burnt ETH. This means that the fees are worth to the users X amount of dollars (whatever it costed them to acquire the ETH) and hence their willingness to spend them is also priced in dollars. If you disagree with this assumption then you can price them in ETH but I would caution against doing this as this implies that transaction fees are not price-sensitive and users would be willing to pay higher and higher amounts for a transaction if the price of ETH goes up. Which is another way of seeing why fundamentally transaction fees must be priced in USD terms.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ironically I think withdrawals opening could increase price because it reduces a lot of uncertainty and gives clarity and control to large institutions (e.g. Cloudflare) that want to get more involved in staking but have investors to keep top of mind. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think so too, in the long term, as it de-risks staking.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of my disbelief in the narrative also stems from there being few \u201cintracrypto\u201d applications that are truly innovative (Maker, Uniswap, Curve though not really anymore because of UNI V3 , ENS, Lido though they\u2019re problematic in the interim , OpenSea). Everything else feels like iteration on these ideas, where teams are mostly building for each other and not a general customer base. And that\u2019s okay if things start out as mostly an enthusiasts\u2019 community that draws some attention. Also that list is not meant to be exhaustive.</p>\n\n<p>Applications that interface with the real world and real finance aren\u2019t really here yet and so a lot remains to be seen whether Ethereum ushers in this world we envision.

It includes the USS Utah Memorial, USS Oklahoma Memorial, USS Missouri Memorial and the iconic USS Arizona Memorial. It also includes the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum and the USS Bowfin museum inside the submarine (sorry, no kids younger than 4).\n\nThe USS Arizona Memorial straddles but does not touch the Arizona, which remains submerged in about 40 feet of water. Access is by boat only. While the superstructure and two of the four main gun turrets were removed, the barbette of one of the turrets remains visible above the water. Since her sinking, oil still leaks from the hull, with more than 2.3 quarts (2.18 liters) escaping into the harbor per day\n\nThe memorial, built in 1962, marks the resting place of 1,102 of the 1,177 sailors and Marines killed in the attack, most of whom died when a bomb detonated the ship's magazines. The memorial has three main parts: entry, assembly room and shrine.

It includes the USS Utah Memorial, USS Oklahoma Memorial, USS Missouri Memorial and the iconic USS Arizona Memorial. It also includes the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum and the USS Bowfin museum inside the submarine (sorry, no kids younger than 4).</p>\n\n<p>The USS Arizona Memorial straddles but does not touch the Arizona, which remains submerged in about 40 feet of water. Access is by boat only. While the superstructure and two of the four main gun turrets were removed, the barbette of one of the turrets remains visible above the water. Since her sinking, oil still leaks from the hull, with more than 2.3 quarts (2.18 liters) escaping into the harbor per day</p>\n\n<p>The memorial, built in 1962, marks the resting place of 1,102 of the 1,177 sailors and Marines killed in the attack, most of whom died when a bomb detonated the ship&#39;s magazines. The memorial has three main parts: entry, assembly room and shrine.

I'm always a proponent of open systems and maybe the openness of MEV is a good way to reduce it at the protocol level. Can we build protocols (aka MEV resistant defi) that mitigate MEV if we can see the MEV? It seems like we'd have a much better chance than when MEV is all but invisible as you mentioned.
