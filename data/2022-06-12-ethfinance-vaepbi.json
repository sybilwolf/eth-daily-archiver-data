In service of that commitment and to adhere to our risk management framework, we have activated a clause in our Terms of Use that will allow for this process to take place. Celsius has valuable assets and we are working diligently to meet our obligations. </p>\n\n<p>We are taking this necessary action for the benefit of our entire community in order to stabilize liquidity and operations while we take steps to preserve and protect assets. Furthermore, customers will continue to accrue rewards during the pause in line with our commitment to our customers.</p>\n\n<p>We understand that this news is difficult, but we believe that our decision to pause withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts is the most responsible action we can take to protect our community. We are working with a singular focus: to protect and preserve assets to meet our obligations to customers. Our ultimate objective is stabilizing liquidity and restoring withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts as quickly as possible. There is a lot of work ahead as we consider various options, this process will take time, and there may be delays.</p>\n\n<p>We thank the incredible Celsius community for your support today. It is our pleasure to serve you. Our operations continue and we will continue to share information with the community as it becomes available. </p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,\nThe Celsius team\u201d</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-12 19:15:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ic5p533","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vaepbi","parent_id":"t3_vaepbi","score":37,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/curious-b","body":"tl;dr: \"Steady lads.

NFTs however (can=99,99% do) take a fee to the developers when trading licences, this should be illegal in those districtions. So a bad solution and i was sure there won't be a real usage. Most remaining use cases could be solved with a currency without digits which is also non divisable and more gas efficient and all are same (which is the truth in most projects like licences).\n\nSo now NFTs should work quite well for carbon credits. Sure we can't bring emissions to zero, but we can do \"net zero\". For this we need projects that save CO2. The simplest is trees, but the hard part is that you need much more than you think (and calculate in simple models) because you need to compensate the time the prior CO2 is still in the atmosphere.\n\nSo now really simply each project and it's detailed can be a carbon credit. If the project fails, like trees dying due to future drought, they become worthless or are recalled. Simple to do it in great manner and in real time. With satellites this could be doable also for the rain forest where each grid point gets a carbon credit.\n\nWe know already that currently the rain forest is a liability for Brazil, it takes away space and produces free oxygen, not a good business model. However with selling the carbon credits it becomes an income to restore it and grow it.\n\nEurope has also launched carbon credits trading. But it's difficult and there is bribing because so much money is behind it. To kickstart it, large companies were gifted the necessary credits. So far a somewhat acceptable kickstart initiative (jobs!). The business guys came to the great idea to sell them immediately and just rebuy them the day before the end of period. Free cash today to due things VS the money sleeping. Well, the price exploded before the due date. Now the companies couldn't afford it anymore. (Actually they were shorting it in WallStreet slang, just unknowingly).\n\nGuess what happened? Well loan forgiveness, the state accepted it. Otherwise the business would have gone out of business and the jobs (voters!) were in trouble.\n\nIt's kind of bribery. Sure if it's the official way it's no longer bribery but still. There is no accountability.\n\nWill credits work without audits just on the blockchain? Surly not. However if people (auditors) have to stake something they have a better initiative to not fake it, even if its unauditable China (just satellites and correction factors).\n\nWhere else is bribery? Well... Tesla Style. Tesla sold the \"Carbon emissions savings\" to other car companies. That wa their business model for a long time, not building cars! This is now a hornet nest with the Tesla fans, but it is what is is. The Europe Union is leading also in this sector, but far from perfect.\n\nToday all car manufacturers have given a quote how much their fleet can emit. So it prevents cheating if they offer small cars but only sell large cars. That was the reason the companies sold at a loss the small cars, to prevent the penality over overshooting the fleet budget which is even higher. The rest was bought from Tesla.\n\nStarting next year (iirc) as electric car owner you personally (not Tesla!) can sell (depending on milage, usage,..) your carbon savings to a middle company which will sell it on the carbon stock exchange. This is actually also a bribery. Why?\n\nWell you don't save, just emitt less. If a electric car driver can sell it savings, where does bicycle drivers can sell their saving? Should be higher, shouldn't it? Or people without car could sell even more. So we still rewards consumption and not savings. (Maybe also a inherent flaw of capitalism, you can't reward people for no consumption or negative consumption).\n\nThe NFTs could help with a small puzzle in the middle.

To get rid of the mosquitoes, islanders created the Ala Wai canal parallel the shore. The canal, originally known as the Waikiki Drainage Canal, was created by a Hawaiian dredging company run by Walter F. Dillingham.
