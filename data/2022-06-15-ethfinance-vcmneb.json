I think the real issue is that they don't understand cryptocurrency at all, and get really hung up on the \"currency\" element of it. In that regard, they'll tell you that it's made up, has no actual value, isn't \"backed by anything,\" and because of its volatile/speculative nature, isn't suitable to be a currency. Or, they'll argue the speculative angle, and in that regard will claim that it isn't like a stock - ownership in a profitable company that actually makes things, etc, but this is a losing proposition also. Coins are not stocks. They're not the same. There are plenty of things in this world that have value and are speculated upon: trading cards, precious metals, vintage furniture, etc. What really matters is that if someone wants something and they're willing to pay x amount for it, then it's worth at least that much, at least to someone. If you have hundreds, or thousands, or millions of people wanting that thing, and all willing to pay for it, then it has value to those people. \n\nAlso, on the dividend front, staking can provide something similar. By helping to secure the network, you earn rewards/fees for doing so, and essentially are paid a dividend. It's an entirely new paradigm with a similar result, but understanding that isn't going to happen if you're not even open to understanding that cryptocurrencies are not stocks, they are something different, and may also have value. \n\nOn the Ponzi front though... there are an awful lot of ponzi schemes in crypto. That doesn't make crypto itself a Ponzi scheme, but it becomes easier to understand the mindset of a person that's dead set against crypto when what stands out in the space are the Ponzi's. When crypto makes obvious it's value to your average Joe, and they can see it fitting into their life, and those use cases speak louder than the scams and ponzi's, I think you'll see this argument start to go away. But not until. \n\nOne thing I'm quite sure of though, is that if the conversation is always an argument, and one moment pro-crypto people are screaming \"haha idiot, look how much I'm making,\" and the next moment, anti-crypto people are screaming \"haha, I told you it was a scam, get rekt,\" there's never going to be any common ground found, and nobody's going to learn anything.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s clear they&#39;re not following anything, just dunking on crypto because they missed the boat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve made this comment before, but I think that&#39;s probably the case in a small number of people only.

Essentially every $100 down, I start looking to open a new position with a liquidation point $100 lower. The beauty of this trading strategy, is that when ETH tends to do 50x from the bottom, catching the bottom means you can get liquidated multiple times and still the price will go up enough to cover your losses and then leave plenty of profit. \n\n**[UPDATE 6/18] that long above got liquidated, new long opened at $961 and 7 trading stacks remaining.** \n\nIf this position holds and this was indeed the bottom, my strategy for cashing out is to keep it open until $4800 with no sells...then sell 10% of the still open position every time the price goes up another 20%.\n\n\nSo the sells would be as follows: \n\n* $4,800 - sell 10%, to have 90% left \n* $5,760 - sell 10% to have 81% left\n* $6,912 - sell 10% to have 73% left\n* $8,294 - sell 10% to have 66% left  \n* $9,953 - sell 10% to have 60% left\n* $11,943 - sell 10% to have 54% left \n* $14,332 - sell 10% to have 49% left\n* $17,199 - sell 10% to have 44% left\n* $20,639 - sell 10% to have 40% left\n* $24,766 - sell 10% to have 36% left\n* $29,720 - sell 10% to have 32% left \n* $35,664 - sell 10% to have 29% left\n* $42,796 - sell 10% to have 26% left\n* $51,356 - sell 10% to have 23% left\n* $61,627 - sell 10% to have 21% left\n* $73,952 - sell ...well you get the idea\n\nessentially this way you do 3 things:\n\n1. take plenty of cash off and profit off the table before we even reach current ATH...so if its a double top, you are already in profit off this entry\n2. take plenty of cash and profit of the table on the way up, while letting you still hold a sizeable position wherever ATH is\n3. if ETH goes truly crazy and we reach a million dollars per coin, you'll still have a portion of your stack to take advantage of the crazy prices. \n\nExpectations wise: I have 2 numbers...first MILD if we just have a normal run to match our COVID run. And second WILD if we have an epic run to match the change in fundamentals. Remember, this next run, we'll have EIP1559 for the full run, we'll have the merge doing an instant triple halfning AND removing all new production for 6 months, and this next cycle we will break the ATH on the ratio after consolidating the ratio for 5 years, which tends to lead to truly epic moves on the ratio, which in turn adds all the hype of ETH becoming the #1 coin \n\n* ETHBTC ratio. \n* MILD: if we match our COVID run, we'll 5x from the bottom, which would put us at .25($50,000+ if BTC is $200-300K)\n* WILD: if we go truly parabolic, my [original ratio chart](https://i.imgur.com/WzeSzN7.jpg) has us hitting 2-3 BTC per 1ETH during peak ratio fomo\n\n* ETHUSD price:\n* MILD: if we match our COVID run, we are looking at 56x from the bottom. So right now that would put us at $56K per ETH if we match the COVID run.\n* WILD: which would coincide with the ETHBTC run and would also coincide with a big BTC run since people taking profits on the ratio would drag it up too helping it break out. I see BTC hitting ~$400K next cycle with a potential for a million dollar BTC if things get truly crazy for them too.

Had one 1300psu (top notch ev) burn out on me. Never had any issues with overheating , but I probably had my neighbors talking because my garage sounded like bees. 3 rigs, that\u2019s 18 overclocked nanos buzzing their ass off on a thin wooden cutout sitting on a Home Depot cheap 20.00 rack. I like my setup open like such - easy to troubleshoot and replace things. Two  mobo batteries got roasted. I had steel fans drilled to a base of wooden osb,  stacked 2x high , took off the protective grids to improve cfu. Had 3 of these double fans.</p>\n\n<p>I came off my main panel with a 60a breaker after verifying my residence could handle it, with a fluke multimeter. Not a licensed electrician, found a diy. Then, got two #6 hots and a #10 ground. (Im referring to three wires, gauge sizes, and they were about 100ft) Perfect for 4 15 amp breakers . Wired it out to a shop sub panel. I also will install a Tesla charger in the same panel. Had 100 down on a loaded out tri motor since the i read the specs. The 3 large outer flat prong style female  220. It was intended for backup emergency power, now it\u2019s gonna be my cyber plug</p>\n\n<p>Worth noting: the ev that got roasted was replaced and fixed by them, free. Good people over there</p>\n\n<p>I should put those scripts on GitHub.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-08 01:06:41","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-07-08 01:34:45","id":"ifbhpr0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vcmneb","parent_id":"t1_ici5u5a","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/PinkPuppyBall","body":"Sons of Ethereum!\n\nOf ethfinance!\n\nMy brothers.\n\nI see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.\n\nA day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our wallets and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day.\n\nAn hour of wolves and shattered dreams when the Age of Ethereum comes crashing down, but it is not this day!\n\n\nThis day we buy!\n\nBy all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the ETH!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sons of Ethereum!</p>\n\n<p>Of ethfinance!</p>\n\n<p>My brothers.</p>\n\n<p>I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.</p>\n\n<p>A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our wallets and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day.</p>\n\n<p>An hour of wolves and shattered dreams when the Age of Ethereum comes crashing down, but it is not this day!</p>\n\n<p>This day we buy!</p>\n\n<p>By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the ETH!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-15 02:16:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"icfo5jo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vcmneb","parent_id":"t3_vcmneb","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/tecateman420","body":"$10 dollars at $1000 it's my order let's go","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$10 dollars at $1000 it&#39;s my order let&#39;s go</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-15 02:20:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"icfof4s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vcmneb","parent_id":"t1_icfo5jo","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/kenzi28","body":"For ~~Frodo~~ ETH.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For <del>Frodo</del> ETH.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-15 02:22:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"icfoj3g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vcmneb","parent_id":"t1_icfo5jo","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Papazio","body":"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s that?

Hardly any buyers will lead to a price rise. It just might be going from $500 to $2,000 initially instead of $5,000 to $20,000 which many of use would&#39;ve called for a year ago. Long term though, the merge makes Ethereum the first actually profitable blockchain. Unironically, few understand this.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I&#39;d also like to add that at this rate, more money will be in stablecoins on Ethereum than in ETH marketcap.
