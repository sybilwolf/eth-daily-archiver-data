The password is to *Unlock* the locally stored seed phrase and private keys (You can see the password prompt button says \"Unlock\").\n\nSome more information on how all this works:\n\n- The seed phrase is just used to store a big number in a way which is more convenient for humans. Each word maps to a number and together they make up a big number.\n- This number is generated randomly and only locally.\n- This number is then used to generate private keys. Each private key has a 0x address associated. This is also called an *Account*.\n- In the fuction to generate the private key there is an *index* parameter so the same seed can generate multiple private keys/Accounts. The first private key is generated with index 0, then the next with index 1 and so on.\n- Private keys is what is used in Ethereum. You can receive ETH or tokens on the 0x address but you need the private key to sign transactions to send funds or interact with smart contracts.\n- The private keys should always stay in your possession since whoever has the private key can sign transactions to take your funds.\n- Same thing for the seed phrase since the seed phrase can re-genenerate the private key.\n- The Metamask password is just used to encrypt the seed phrase locally as a protection if someone gets access to your computer. But the password is not actually related to your Ethereum accounts/keys and is useless without the encrypted seed phrase data.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You don&#39;t really &quot;log in&quot; into Metamask.

Each word maps to a number and together they make up a big number.</li>\n<li>This number is generated randomly and only locally.</li>\n<li>This number is then used to generate private keys. Each private key has a 0x address associated. This is also called an <em>Account</em>.</li>\n<li>In the fuction to generate the private key there is an <em>index</em> parameter so the same seed can generate multiple private keys/Accounts.
