This effectively allows rollups to scale another 100x from their current levels.\n\n- **Verge:** Introduces stateless clients which means the blockchain can be verified without needing the complete history of the blockchain which came before it. This allows validators to run without the need for a large hard drive, dramatically reducing the hardware requirements to run a node, thus improving decentralisation.\n\n- **Purge:** Technical debt elimination and elimination of historical data. This comes in multiple forms such as historical data expiry, state expiry and the removal of numerous other unnecessary functions. Much of this will make node operation and validating much easier as well as simplifying the wider Ethereum codebase.\n\n- **Splurge:** Numerous miscellaneous upgrades such as proposer builder separation, account abstraction and zkSNARK-ifying everything. These will further lighten the load for node operators and give smart contract wallets more functionality.\n\nIt is worth noting that these upgrades won\u2019t all rollout together under the above names like the merge.

What you call \"default data\" is basically stuff like timestamp, difficulty, gas price, gas limit etc. so everything without the transactions, so in fact a zero tx block. Looking at etherscan the size of such a block is only 0.5kb [https://etherscan.io/block/15034732](https://etherscan.io/block/15034732) \\- the problem of course is the size of a full block. The size of a full block however is hard to estimate, because depending on the calldata the size can vary wildy. But we can look at average block size here: [https://etherscan.io/chart/blocksize](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocksize) which is around 100kb per block. So at a current 14s block time we're writing about \\~0.4mb per minute to the blockchain. If we change block times to 1s we would write about 6mb per minute.\n2. One issue with shorter block times is state bloat. Like said above the blockchain size would increase with a factor of 14 (14s blocks to 1s block). Additionally the computing work per block would increase too. That means that running a node would require a lot more disk space and computing power, making it less easy to run an Ethereum node for the normal user, leading to more centralization. That is btw the way a lot of other chains took, like BSC (Which is basically geth with the block times cranked up to the max, so you need a very beefy machine to sync to the BSC chain)\n3. Block time will change to a fixed 12s after the merge (Currently it's variable), but I don't think there are plans to change that interval right now.\n\nEdit: Note that block times are actually not 14s right now, but more like \\~16s because of the difficulty bomb https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This topic is quite complex, and I am no expert, but I will try to answer these questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What you call &quot;default data&quot; is basically stuff like timestamp, difficulty, gas price, gas limit etc. so everything without the transactions, so in fact a zero tx block.
