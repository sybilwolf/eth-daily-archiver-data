Next up, we have the Sepolia testnet merge which is ready for deployment under Lodestar&#39;s newest release v0.39.0! This release is recommended to all users of Lodestar.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone running sepolia, the network configurations and the updated TTD has been baked into the configurations so you may use --network sepolia to test your setup for the Sepolia merge estimated for July 5/6.. Our merge-script which allows you to easily startup a lodestar-geth, lodestar-nethermind or lodestar-besu combination has been updated and includes configurations for Sepolia under the lodestar/merge-script directory. More to follow on how to use our merge-script to streamline your setup coming shortly! </p>\n\n<p>Major changes to be aware of include the deprecation of accounts CLI and release of our flare CLI tool for testing useful to devs, testers and researchers (e.g. mass slashings). This release is now compatible with Gnosis Chain. Other performance, metrics and docs related fixes are included with this update</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-30 12:52:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ieczbc4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vo0190","parent_id":"t3_vo0190","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Itur_ad_Astra","body":"There's a fight atm whether June is going to close as a >50% drop month or not...\n\nWhat a month.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There&#39;s a fight atm whether June is going to close as a &gt;50% drop month or not...</p>\n\n<p>What a month.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-06-29 23:13:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ieace20","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vo0190","parent_id":"t3_vo0190","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"And, I believe, the first red engulfing 6-Month candle in crypto history.
