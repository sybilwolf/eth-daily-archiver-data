In essence, it's an academically interesting solution to a problem that doesn't really exist in practice, and only sounds like one by ignoring most of the practical issues.\n\nI very intentionally chose blockchain because it's much easier to define. The issue is that many newcomers assume that crypto is supposed to be used like we use dollars or our debit cards due to the misnomer of a name cryptocurrency has become. Crypto isn't really a good currency primarily due to Gresham's law and the supply schedules of most cryptos. However, that of course doesn't mean that these networks are useless. Far from it.\n\n>Expecting laypeople to secure a static private key as sole proof of identity is a disaster, as anyone who knows fuck all about designing secure systems could tell you. Not only does it mean any mistake is irrevocably catastrophic, it amplifies much more common attack vectors like phishing and social engineering.\n\nThis can and already is being abstracted away in a mixture of centralised and decentralised solutions. First off, I need to clarify that the importance of crypto as a technology is the opt-in nature of permissionless value transfer *not* giving this to everyone and expecting everyone to use it this way. It's a lot like privacy. Most people will give it up for convenience but for anyone who thinks it should be a human right, it is the ability to opt out which is important and not the inherent protection of everyone's privacy. Secondly, everyone custodying their own assets can be abstracted away with differing degrees of permissionlessness. For example, there is fully permissionless social recovery with Argent wallet where you delegate some friends or family you trust to effectively vet for you if you ever lose your funds and need to regain access on a new device (it's a super easy do too). Alternatively, Coinbase recently released a wallet where they split your keys into 3 where you need 2 of 3 keys to recover. Coinbase has one, your device has another and a third one I believe was on a cloud service separate to Coinbase such as iCloud for iPhone users. Now for those who want convenience, they can still use a \"trusted\" institution like they do stock brokers today if they find it most convenient. The significant part as I said is the option to opt out and the GME saga has shown us lately why we probably shouldn't be trusting these \"reputable\" institutions as much as we do. Finally, these are the options we have come up with today. There will be more solutions created in the future.\n\n>Transactions are irreversible even when provable fraud or mistakes have occurred, there is no flexibility for building safeguards and defense in depth on-chain.\n\nThis is often the case in traditional finance too and much like in my previous point, for the masses who likely won't be operating on the base layer protocol, this can be abstracted away with a combination of other layers on tops of centralised, semi-centralised or decentralised solutions which will allow for disputes on the second layers before the transaction settles on the base layer. These things just take time to build out but once built, there are huge efficiency gains which come from all parties sharing a financial base layer like Ethereum.\n\n>In practice, it requires as much if not even more trust than existing systems. This is a pervasive misconception in the space, but to provide an example: nobody cares that address A gave money to address B, they care that person A paid person B - and the chain can't validate that address A belongs to real life person A. That's handled by the existing internet and the semi-centralized PKI and DNS infrastructure.\n\nAgain, there are solutions being built for this such as Bright ID and many others. This is no more of an issue than me not knowing if you control the email address you gave me last week. For the most part it is not common at all and as above there are ways to build on top of this to ensure that I know if any of my contacts have changed their wallet addresses or have been compromised. \n\n>Even with PoS, they are incredibly slow and inefficient, such that only the barest minimum can actually be processed on-chain\n\nThis isn't true with the long term modular blockchain based scaling method with zero knowledge rollups and data sharding. This is a super deep dive tech wise but in short, with rollups compressing and batching transactions, they can scale to be cheaper as the more people use them since the cost to settle a batch on the main chain is shared by all participants.

In essence, it&#39;s an academically interesting solution to a problem that doesn&#39;t really exist in practice, and only sounds like one by ignoring most of the practical issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I very intentionally chose blockchain because it&#39;s much easier to define. The issue is that many newcomers assume that crypto is supposed to be used like we use dollars or our debit cards due to the misnomer of a name cryptocurrency has become. Crypto isn&#39;t really a good currency primarily due to Gresham&#39;s law and the supply schedules of most cryptos. However, that of course doesn&#39;t mean that these networks are useless. Far from it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Expecting laypeople to secure a static private key as sole proof of identity is a disaster, as anyone who knows fuck all about designing secure systems could tell you. Not only does it mean any mistake is irrevocably catastrophic, it amplifies much more common attack vectors like phishing and social engineering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This can and already is being abstracted away in a mixture of centralised and decentralised solutions. First off, I need to clarify that the importance of crypto as a technology is the opt-in nature of permissionless value transfer <em>not</em> giving this to everyone and expecting everyone to use it this way. It&#39;s a lot like privacy. Most people will give it up for convenience but for anyone who thinks it should be a human right, it is the ability to opt out which is important and not the inherent protection of everyone&#39;s privacy. Secondly, everyone custodying their own assets can be abstracted away with differing degrees of permissionlessness. For example, there is fully permissionless social recovery with Argent wallet where you delegate some friends or family you trust to effectively vet for you if you ever lose your funds and need to regain access on a new device (it&#39;s a super easy do too). Alternatively, Coinbase recently released a wallet where they split your keys into 3 where you need 2 of 3 keys to recover. Coinbase has one, your device has another and a third one I believe was on a cloud service separate to Coinbase such as iCloud for iPhone users. Now for those who want convenience, they can still use a &quot;trusted&quot; institution like they do stock brokers today if they find it most convenient. The significant part as I said is the option to opt out and the GME saga has shown us lately why we probably shouldn&#39;t be trusting these &quot;reputable&quot; institutions as much as we do. Finally, these are the options we have come up with today. There will be more solutions created in the future.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Transactions are irreversible even when provable fraud or mistakes have occurred, there is no flexibility for building safeguards and defense in depth on-chain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is often the case in traditional finance too and much like in my previous point, for the masses who likely won&#39;t be operating on the base layer protocol, this can be abstracted away with a combination of other layers on tops of centralised, semi-centralised or decentralised solutions which will allow for disputes on the second layers before the transaction settles on the base layer. These things just take time to build out but once built, there are huge efficiency gains which come from all parties sharing a financial base layer like Ethereum.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In practice, it requires as much if not even more trust than existing systems. This is a pervasive misconception in the space, but to provide an example: nobody cares that address A gave money to address B, they care that person A paid person B - and the chain can&#39;t validate that address A belongs to real life person A. That&#39;s handled by the existing internet and the semi-centralized PKI and DNS infrastructure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, there are solutions being built for this such as Bright ID and many others. This is no more of an issue than me not knowing if you control the email address you gave me last week. For the most part it is not common at all and as above there are ways to build on top of this to ensure that I know if any of my contacts have changed their wallet addresses or have been compromised. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even with PoS, they are incredibly slow and inefficient, such that only the barest minimum can actually be processed on-chain</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t true with the long term modular blockchain based scaling method with zero knowledge rollups and data sharding. This is a super deep dive tech wise but in short, with rollups compressing and batching transactions, they can scale to be cheaper as the more people use them since the cost to settle a batch on the main chain is shared by all participants. Furthermore sharding of data across different nodes on the network and state expiry of old data will eventually allow for scaling into the hundreds of thousands if not millions of transactions per second all while maintaining the base layer security guarantees.

The KB is perfect for that. I mean it's not a full on wiki, but you can quite easily cross link KB articles in a wiki style. I can probably even automate that. The KB is good for basic stuff like that. But what if you really want to *teach* so that people might pay you for it? You need more than a KB! So here's the thing, I haven't even integrated the learning stuff yet. Like none of it. Why? Because the integration is *veeerry expensive* and I didn't want to pony up the cash if no one took to this idea. I'm cheap, so what!\n\nThe actual learning plugin is legit af and completely integrates with the gamification plugin so you can reward students and teachers with achievements, badges and more. I'm working on a post with a HUUUUGEEE list of features that I promise educators and students will love. Teachers can create structured lesson plans with prerequesite courses, tests, quizzes, reward users with achievements and ranks, offer one on one mentoring, and even sell them as individual courses or memberships if they choose. Students can track their course progress from their profile page, message teachers, and SOO MUCH MORE MAN! I'm literally grinding this thing as hard as I can, solo, so progress is going to be slow until I get some more help. Everyday I pick a problem and stab at it until it stops movin! Stay tuned though!

There are for example 3 articles at the very beginning, &quot;what is blockchain&quot;, &quot;history of ethereum&quot;, and &quot;blockchain from development perspective&quot;. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m not interested in dev and I&#39;m not a history nerd, so I click on what is blockchain, and I get a list of articles/videos of different people, and every article is shown with a rating (either rated by learners or simply by amount of engagement, i.e. whether learners continue to the next article in the network or if they choose another article because they still didn&#39;t understand). So I choose an article, I read it, and then I am given a list of articles to deepen my knowledge, e.g. &quot;how blockchains work&quot;, &quot;how blockchains could change the world&quot;, etc.  </p>\n\n<p>And each of these topics are created by authors putting tags on their articles. Though I&#39;m not sure how monetization would fit into this, maybe everyone would get a certain amount of tokens every day to read X amount of articles, and if they wanted more, they&#39;d have to pay, and that would go to the authors?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not dumb at all. The KB is perfect for that. I mean it&#39;s not a full on wiki, but you can quite easily cross link KB articles in a wiki style. I can probably even automate that. The KB is good for basic stuff like that. But what if you really want to <em>teach</em> so that people might pay you for it? You need more than a KB! So here&#39;s the thing, I haven&#39;t even integrated the learning stuff yet. Like none of it. Why? Because the integration is <em>veeerry expensive</em> and I didn&#39;t want to pony up the cash if no one took to this idea. I&#39;m cheap, so what!</p>\n\n<p>The actual learning plugin is legit af and completely integrates with the gamification plugin so you can reward students and teachers with achievements, badges and more. I&#39;m working on a post with a HUUUUGEEE list of features that I promise educators and students will love. Teachers can create structured lesson plans with prerequesite courses, tests, quizzes, reward users with achievements and ranks, offer one on one mentoring, and even sell them as individual courses or memberships if they choose. Students can track their course progress from their profile page, message teachers, and SOO MUCH MORE MAN! I&#39;m literally grinding this thing as hard as I can, solo, so progress is going to be slow until I get some more help. Everyday I pick a problem and stab at it until it stops movin! Stay tuned though! I have big ideas to help people make money! Better yet, come use the site so I can collect some metrics and improve it!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-07 14:01:24","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-07-07 15:27:51","id":"if9aghi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vtaet9","parent_id":"t1_if95oh3","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SabishiiFury","body":"Mhm, isn't it something that gitcoin does?
