Well, first of all, anyone who has a phone with Rogers, or uses them for their ISP, has had no internet access all day, and can't make calls either (this includes businesses).  But there's more trouble than that: the Canadian banking system has centralized all its debit payments through a network called [Interac](https://www.interac.ca/en/), and for some reason, they apparently decided to funnel all their traffic through Rogers servers, instead of the general, decentralized internet.  Why? Who the fuck knows, seems like a terrible idea.  Anyways, this means that all day long, across the entire country of Canada (population 38 million) no one has been able to use their debit card, and no business can accept it, because the centralized network that runs it is down (cash is still fine, and the credit card system doesn't seem to be affected).\n\nBUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!  In Canada we don't have venmo or cashapp -- instead we use Interac E-transfers, which are obviously *also down* at the moment.\n\nSo, to put this in perspective for my American friends: imagine waking up and finding out that anyone who has a Verizon phone can't use it, anyone who has home internet access from Comcast can't log on, no one across the country can pay for anything with their debit card, and cashapp and venmo are also down.  That's the situation in Canada **right now,** and has been all day.\n\nSo the next time someone tells you that users or businesses 'don't care about decentralization' please, PLEASE point them towards this post.\n\n(written on my laptop tethered to my phone --non-Rogers-- because my home ISP piggybacks off of Rogers copper and is still down.

This is being run as an approval vote: you may read through the list of ten applicants, then approve (by selecting) any number of them who you approve of to act as financial stewards. The Snapshot poll will be up for another 17 hours from now, and anyone with an EVMavericks lion NFT can participate.</p>\n\n<p>The next step in this process will be for the newly-elected stewards to solicit and assemble proposals for our first financial period: what asset allocation will our treasury maintain, and what budget will be provided to the stewards? We&#39;ll gather up a number of our best options so they can be put to a Snapshot vote (the last vote pertaining to stewards for a good long while!) shortly.</p>\n\n<p>Again, <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/evmaverick.eth/proposal/0xe04cf59acfe130cad5c2abc9d5f4b10807106154e630611706584ea763468a7d\">Snapshot vote here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Our stake-a-thon project has just gotten started with a kickoff meeting a few days ago! Just setting up some of the organizational structure for now, plenty of time to join in and help out over at #stake-a-thon in the discord.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-07 23:46:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ifbbf5j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vu2mgb","parent_id":"t3_vu2mgb","score":45,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Chapo_Rouge","body":"Ethereum\n\nedit : Damn Mister\\_Eth is too good at this !","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum</p>\n\n<p>edit : Damn Mister_Eth is too good at this !</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-07 22:00:31","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-07-07 22:07:48","id":"ifb1p8s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vu2mgb","parent_id":"t3_vu2mgb","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Allahambra21","body":"$1252.82","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$1252.82</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-07 22:02:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ifb1xol","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vu2mgb","parent_id":"t1_ifb1p8s","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/ethacct","body":"[Hey yo lesson here Bey: you come at the king, you best not miss.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvmO99MEdg)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvmO99MEdg\">Hey yo lesson here Bey: you come at the king, you best not miss.</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-07 23:19:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ifb96fo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vu2mgb","parent_id":"t1_ifb1p8s","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/ProfessionaIAct","body":"In case you have missed this on Sepolia merge https://twitter.com/MaruPelkar/status/1545335205728100353?s=20&t=pv554QQymFDXtXi6oAm3MQ","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In case you have missed this on Sepolia merge <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaruPelkar/status/1545335205728100353?s=20&amp;t=pv554QQymFDXtXi6oAm3MQ\">https://twitter.com/MaruPelkar/status/1545335205728100353?s=20&amp;t=pv554QQymFDXtXi6oAm3MQ</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-08 05:40:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ifc4wgc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_vu2mgb","parent_id":"t3_vu2mgb","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/OyuruKemono","body":"Well that's awesome.
