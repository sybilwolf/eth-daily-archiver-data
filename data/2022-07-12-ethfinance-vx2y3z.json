They can also choose to receive this in cash or Bitcoin as I understand it. It's optimistically late August.

When you upload a file to your Documents and mark that file public, it automatically shows up on the <a href=\"https://caches.xyz/documents/\">Global Documents</a> page for everyone to search, view or download! Pretty cool way to share files right? Just by sharing it, everyone has access to it, even if they don&#39;t know you! By default your uploads will show there, along with any public group file shares. Public group post attachments are automatically added! You don&#39;t have to do nuthin&#39; but share it! If you don&#39;t want that, just change the privacy settings. This page is public right now but I will make it members only soon.</p>\n\n<p>Aight, this dank ass cheeba ain&#39;t gonna smoke itself.
