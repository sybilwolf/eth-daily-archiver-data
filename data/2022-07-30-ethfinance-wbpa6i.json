In addition to the 4-Eth minipools we've been hearing about, they have some other major improvements in the works that could easily catapult them past Lido in terms of number of validators (which, because it's actually a fully decentralized protocol, would be a good thing, not a bad thing).

If you're staking with only your own Eth, this is actually a huge inefficiency in decentralization terms. Rocket Pool is planning to have the capacity to turn the thousands of solo stakers who are currently just staking their own Eth into a powerful engine for decentralization, by allowing them to take **7x** their Eth (rather than the current 0x if they're a solo staker, or 1x if they're using today's Rocket Pool) in minority stakers' stake along for the ride.\n\nWhy would solo stakers sign up for this, other than to help out with decentralization? Well, with Rocket Pool today, you get a fraction of all the staking rewards (and in future tips/MEV) from the minority stake you're operating with your minipools. But this update would **7x** that commission.\n\nA massive win-win.

Remember in 2017 bcash came close to flipping and few BTC mega whales had all their coins ready to move into BCH, but that never came.. </p>\n\n<p>And the media flip will be legendary. Media has a keen interest in crypto, but so far they are still playing both sides i.e its a scam + its a great technology. This is mainly because of BTC - it doesnt have much use cases, and coupled with its energy consumption + anarchist &quot;want to replace USD&quot; sloganeering makes BTC the worst representative of the space and everyone outside of crypto thinks the whole space is the same as BTC, they dont see that ETH and dapps arent trying to compete as money but trying to build actual use cases that could be used by mom n pop. PoS ETH will tick all the boxes that make it a solid investment both for media as well as traditional investors</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-30 15:30:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iib83dt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wbpa6i","parent_id":"t1_iiayh1e","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":">they didn't prepare a backup narrative\n\nThey do have one, it's stick with the same narrative + say the market is inefficient and hasn't matured yet","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>they didn&#39;t prepare a backup narrative</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They do have one, it&#39;s stick with the same narrative + say the market is inefficient and hasn&#39;t matured yet</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-07-30 19:18:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iic05pu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wbpa6i","parent_id":"t1_iiayh1e","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Childsp","body":"The merge is not priced in.\n\nPeople still seem to think that all these miners swapping to ETC is a sign that it's \"better\"\n\nPeople have no idea that miners = capital = POS in it's most distilled form.\n\nPeople think decentralized doesn't matter and still believe XRP with no smart contracts is going to $30 a coin even with it's 100 Billion max supply.
