It closed above... but then unfortunately opened this week below meaning even with the green week we still require a red week (or a green week with retests) to see if the 100W MA will actually hold.\n\n[Here's the pic.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/R9rNJ68I/) Pretty basic. We of course need the SPY (as proxy for the S&P) to close above 412.35 tomorrow which is that orange 100W MA. Then next week we'll want the successful retest. If it checks these two boxes, we're set for one more bull leg as that is the key difference between 2008 and all the other dips we've had since.\n\nIssues we face / \"news\" events market makers will attempt to weaponize? U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls tomorrow. CPI next Weds and PPI next Thurs. Mind the surrounding volatility. \n\nAdditionally, every metric is basically roasted and toasted right now, overbought on any timeframe below the weekly -- which is long-term great, just not ideal as we navigate August/September weakness and Merge wildin' out. It's bear flags and bear wedges all throughout every market.\n\nAnd the S&P has printed a second bear div on the daily, joining ETH and BTC charts. Note that the S&P defied and invalidated its July 29 bear div. It can and does happen. Twice though? Let's see. Neither crypto's bear div has resolved OR invalidated yet due to the lack of price action. BTC is starting to resolve it now, closing below $22.7k and ETH will start its down journey below $1575 or that area.\n\nThe wind is blowing downward, I think, this week and next. The key to everything is *how far down* we go.

It closed above... but then unfortunately opened this week below meaning even with the green week we still require a red week (or a green week with retests) to see if the 100W MA will actually hold.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/R9rNJ68I/\">Here&#39;s the pic.</a> Pretty basic. We of course need the SPY (as proxy for the S&amp;P) to close above 412.35 tomorrow which is that orange 100W MA. Then next week we&#39;ll want the successful retest. If it checks these two boxes, we&#39;re set for one more bull leg as that is the key difference between 2008 and all the other dips we&#39;ve had since.</p>\n\n<p>Issues we face / &quot;news&quot; events market makers will attempt to weaponize? U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls tomorrow. CPI next Weds and PPI next Thurs. Mind the surrounding volatility. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, every metric is basically roasted and toasted right now, overbought on any timeframe below the weekly -- which is long-term great, just not ideal as we navigate August/September weakness and Merge wildin&#39; out. It&#39;s bear flags and bear wedges all throughout every market.</p>\n\n<p>And the S&amp;P has printed a second bear div on the daily, joining ETH and BTC charts. Note that the S&amp;P defied and invalidated its July 29 bear div. It can and does happen. Twice though? Let&#39;s see. Neither crypto&#39;s bear div has resolved OR invalidated yet due to the lack of price action. BTC is starting to resolve it now, closing below $22.7k and ETH will start its down journey below $1575 or that area.</p>\n\n<p>The wind is blowing downward, I think, this week and next.
