It aligns beautifully in its thinking with the [Luke Gromen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t9XtCXHV3A) episode on Bankless the other week. I've been saying for about 15 years how fucked the US economy is long-term due to the [unfunded liability](https://www.usdebtclock.org/) number alone ($170T and rising). Both Arthur and Luke describe it as pick one of two but the option of protecting the US dollar from inflation isn't even remotely viable unless you accept that the lifestyle of the US for most of its people will collapse to 3'rd world country levels.\n\nThe *obvious* conclusion of even the quickest peek at the US economy fundamentals is that sometime in the next 30-40 years we need to devalue the dollar by about 80%. This defunds those liabilities without requiring laws to be written which is the only way to solve it because political gridlock isn't going away. Your social security, federal debt held by the public (bonds), federal pensions, veteran's benefits, and some aspects of medicare will all be reduced in real terms. Bond holders are going to get unbelievably wrecked as real rates run negative -8% for a decade. What we see today is just a glimpse of the wreckage that is promised.\n\nA side effect of this process is things like FDIC insurance which is at $250k will effectively be reduced to $50k. Anonymous money transfers have a reporting limit of $10k, which will effective become $2k. It tightens the grip of the surveillance state as a side effect. Minimum wage is already but will increasingly become meaningless unless directly tied to cost of living.\n\nIn the coming world what asset are you going to hold? Bonds will be paid out every cent they are owed but will have their real value destroyed 80%. Real estate won't survive at these prices (in real terms) with higher rates and the dying baby boomer generation (causing sales) unless we just end up in widespread corporate single family home ownership and revert to a new form of corporate feudalism. Gold will probably double in value but I don't see it 5xing in value. Commodities more generally will probably be fine but expect unusual volatility. Stocks have the same structural debt bubble formed by low interest rates and the insane buybacks enabled by PPP loans plus the pension crisis is coming for them. The best most people can hope for in the next few decades is to just not get poorer. Wealth creation is going to be out of reach of most people. It's just going to be a slow rot that comes after a larger portion of the wealth spectrum every year as this process unfolds.\n\nThe general categories of bets I see that will generate wealth in spite of all this are:\n\n1) Whatever processes harvest the life savings of the baby boomers as they die off. This includes a variety of end-of-life services such as geriatric care, hospitals, etc. I wouldn't count on any inheritance saving the millennials or gen-z. It's all going to be harvested by capitalism and our general ineptitude in fixing the medical billing system.\n\n2) Energy transformations. This is one of the only hardware sectors that is seeing explosive growth. This is everything from mirror array solar power plants, photo-voltaic cells for inner city use, wind turbines, a resurgence of nuclear due to recent events in Ukraine, and electric vehicles.\n\n3) Digital technologies. Due to their nature of be built once and copied infinitely, targeted software bets are going to continue to find ways to 100x here and there. This might not be MSFT shares, at this point you might have to go further up the risk curve and have actual knowledge of software and startups to pick winners. A good example of a looming digital transformation is self-driving vehicles. That can automate tens of millions of jobs and transfer value to whomever licenses that software.\n\n4) Crypto. There is a juicy portion of the economy that consists of financial middle-men. The count of jobs being replaced here is smaller but the paycheck to be carved out from them is enormous. Within crypto, well you all mostly know my opinion but I'll point you to my website if you don't. Also squishchaos, hal press, arthur, and some stuff I've written about the coming supply shock on ETH that we're still on track for (merge +18 months).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>That <a href=\"https://cryptohayes.medium.com/max-bidding-7a1c56c1cd07\">Hayes article</a> that&#39;s been posted a few times here really is a banger.

Your social security, federal debt held by the public (bonds), federal pensions, veteran&#39;s benefits, and some aspects of medicare will all be reduced in real terms. Bond holders are going to get unbelievably wrecked as real rates run negative -8% for a decade. What we see today is just a glimpse of the wreckage that is promised.</p>\n\n<p>A side effect of this process is things like FDIC insurance which is at $250k will effectively be reduced to $50k. Anonymous money transfers have a reporting limit of $10k, which will effective become $2k. It tightens the grip of the surveillance state as a side effect. Minimum wage is already but will increasingly become meaningless unless directly tied to cost of living.</p>\n\n<p>In the coming world what asset are you going to hold? Bonds will be paid out every cent they are owed but will have their real value destroyed 80%. Real estate won&#39;t survive at these prices (in real terms) with higher rates and the dying baby boomer generation (causing sales) unless we just end up in widespread corporate single family home ownership and revert to a new form of corporate feudalism. Gold will probably double in value but I don&#39;t see it 5xing in value. Commodities more generally will probably be fine but expect unusual volatility. Stocks have the same structural debt bubble formed by low interest rates and the insane buybacks enabled by PPP loans plus the pension crisis is coming for them. The best most people can hope for in the next few decades is to just not get poorer. Wealth creation is going to be out of reach of most people. It&#39;s just going to be a slow rot that comes after a larger portion of the wealth spectrum every year as this process unfolds.</p>\n\n<p>The general categories of bets I see that will generate wealth in spite of all this are:</p>\n\n<p>1) Whatever processes harvest the life savings of the baby boomers as they die off. This includes a variety of end-of-life services such as geriatric care, hospitals, etc. I wouldn&#39;t count on any inheritance saving the millennials or gen-z. It&#39;s all going to be harvested by capitalism and our general ineptitude in fixing the medical billing system.</p>\n\n<p>2) Energy transformations. This is one of the only hardware sectors that is seeing explosive growth. This is everything from mirror array solar power plants, photo-voltaic cells for inner city use, wind turbines, a resurgence of nuclear due to recent events in Ukraine, and electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>3) Digital technologies. Due to their nature of be built once and copied infinitely, targeted software bets are going to continue to find ways to 100x here and there. This might not be MSFT shares, at this point you might have to go further up the risk curve and have actual knowledge of software and startups to pick winners. A good example of a looming digital transformation is self-driving vehicles. That can automate tens of millions of jobs and transfer value to whomever licenses that software.</p>\n\n<p>4) Crypto. There is a juicy portion of the economy that consists of financial middle-men. The count of jobs being replaced here is smaller but the paycheck to be carved out from them is enormous. Within crypto, well you all mostly know my opinion but I&#39;ll point you to my website if you don&#39;t. Also squishchaos, hal press, arthur, and some stuff I&#39;ve written about the coming supply shock on ETH that we&#39;re still on track for (merge +18 months).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-05 10:44:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ij2xnl1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wgmgjb","parent_id":"t3_wgmgjb","score":78,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ResearcherSad9357","body":"Friedman and others had been saying basically the same thing for decades, the debt \"crisis\" is a libertarian boogie man to scare us from funding government programs.

In essence, it\u2019s just a lowering of the price target, but not really an invalidation of the underlying thesis.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-05 14:33:01","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-08-05 15:10:15","id":"ij3wpu7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wgmgjb","parent_id":"t1_ij3fci2","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Distant-Shores","body":"Link: https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1538576389976252416\n\nYou are right, it seems he states that the number and date was wrong but theory could still be flying","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Link: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1538576389976252416\">https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1538576389976252416</a></p>\n\n<p>You are right, it seems he states that the number and date was wrong but theory could still be flying</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-05 23:20:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ij5mssd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wgmgjb","parent_id":"t1_ij3wpu7","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nitter_not_twitter","body":"[https://nitter.net/SquishChaos/status/1538576389976252416](https://nitter.net/SquishChaos/status/1538576389976252416)  \n\n ^(I'm a bot | )[^(Why & About)](https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&subject=Opt+Out&message=optout)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://nitter.net/SquishChaos/status/1538576389976252416\">https://nitter.net/SquishChaos/status/1538576389976252416</a>  </p>\n\n<p><sup>I&#39;m a bot | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/\"><sup>Why &amp; About</sup></a><sup> | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&amp;subject=Opt+Out&amp;message=optout\"><sup>Opt Out</sup></a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-05 23:20:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ij5mthr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wgmgjb","parent_id":"t1_ij5mssd","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/tutamtumikia","body":"Yeah but that hopium is like drinking diet soda instead of Jolt cola.
