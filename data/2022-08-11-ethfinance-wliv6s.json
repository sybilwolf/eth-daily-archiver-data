Having Bankless host made sense in terms of reach, but David didn&#39;t have much to contribute, and <a href=\"/u/superphiz\">/u/superphiz</a> and <a href=\"/u/nixorokish\">/u/nixorokish</a> were doing more of the orchestration of the large number of people on the stream.  Asking Jonathan Mann to sing whatever YouTube chat was saying was playing with fire.  I wasn&#39;t a fan of having the price chart on the screen, and I was happy to see others expressing the same sentiment in chat.  </p>\n\n<p>Enough of me being a downer, though.

What, if any, rights should a capital layer in a DAO have? I've warned about the plutocratic nature of DAOs we've seen to date before in my [Defi Governance Endgame](http://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame) post. I've called for [separation of influence](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/wavpny/daily_general_discussion_july_29_2022/ii3hpd0/?context=3) on specific topics from capital on measures for which there are objective answers and that a deciding body can be held accountable for. I've written about modular DAO designs and [Sybil resistance mechanisms](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harnessing-collector-psychology-for-good). All of the above implies that **I believe** capital currently has too much influence in DAO governance and a dystopian future awaits us if we don't find a way to reduce that influence.\n\nThat's not actually saying very much though because the capital layer in todays DAOs largely has the final say on **everything** with the only veto power available at all being the multi-sig signers. So if you don't think capital should have *absolute authority* over the DAO you basically should agree with me that as DAOs are structured today, the influence of capital should be reduced. I think this can also make DAOs more effective, even at generating revenue, by forming more autonomous specialist modules with technocratic interaction with the capital layer. However, looking at it from the other direction, why does a capital layer exist at all and if it should exist what influence is correct for it to have over a DAO?\n\nTo answer that we can consider an organization (company or DAO) without a token but with some fungible non-transferrable voting influence. So, no capital layer because influence can't be bought or sold (ignoring bribes). What is this organization missing or what can't it do because of the absence of a capital layer?\n\nThere are some things that seem to be unaffected by this change. Presumably influence would still be redistributed based on the contributions of its members over time. The influence over each decision can be as granular as the organization wants. You can have divisions or modules of the DAO each of which has its own influence distribution and you can have delegation between those modules [RASIC](https://idogrants.org/2018/04/20/how-to-use-a-r-a-s-i-c-roles-accountability-and-responsibility-matrix/) style. Modules can still be accountable based on the distribution of revenue without needing a tradable governance token. So, the capital layer doesn't significantly affect the ability to organize the contributors and hold them accountable to the value alignment layer of the organization. In short, work can still be done, people can still be paid directly from revenue or a treasury, and of course the DAO can still vote, all without capital involved in voting itself.\n\nSo what is missing? Where is the utility of the capital layer?\n\nFirst, it bootstraps easier. Before a revenue stream exists to compensate people how do you attract contributors to your organization? Who is paying those initial developers in most cases where there is a profit motive to the work. Outside of crypto it's first-check venture capital funds. 9/10 companies fail so to compensate these funds for their risk and those failures there must be a promise of future rewards which the governance tokens / private shares represent a claim to. But should this promise of future returns on an investment come with governance power within the DAO? This functionality could be accomplished with some form of structured bond and could be separated from governance. The single thing the bond holders need to guarantee is that the revenue plan promised to them is only changed with their consent.\n\nSecond, the capital layer serves as a form of value battery that can be drawn against like a loan without having to post collateral. This is accomplished via inflation. Tokens can be issued that debase the capital layer which sort of incurs a debt by lowering the token price. We've seen a lot of this in the past 2 years (\\*cough\\* ALCX, \\*cough\\* OHM). Again though this could be accomplished by a structured bond or revenue token as long as more can be minted and sold. Certainly in the debasement case the owners of this token have *standing*. The capital layer are the ones debased so it's reasonable that they should have a say in *how* they are debased. This is why it feels right that veCRV voters vote on CRV issuance.\n\nThird, the capital layer provides Sybil resistance. Proof of *human* work could substitute for this but it takes more work than counting capital so this is what we're doing now. This requires no governance rights but does have an impact on schemes like quadratic voting. Kevin Owaki does a great formalization of this problem [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/characterizing-the-sybil-resistance-problem/11235)\n\nFourth, the capital layer is a powerful motivator and marketing tool/expansion mechanism. This is really how all those \"fair launch\" tokens benefit from giving tokens away to their early users. Enticing new entrants with a share of future revenue is more effective than giving them inalienable governance rights. I don't see that this requires any special governance rights so long as the marketing scheme is approved either prior to the capital layer or by the initial capital layer.\n\nFifth, the capital layer serves as a form of stake/bond. This is the case for things like stkAAVE which serve as an insurance backstop on the protocol and therefore need governance rights over how that code is patched to protect their interests. It also applies to things where capital is used as part of a promise for good behavior like REN for bridging assets or FILE for providing data availability.\n\nSixth, the capital layer provides an egress mechanism. If you disagree with the direction a DAO takes you can vote with your wallet, sell your tokens, walk away, and fork the project and make your own organization (with hookers and blackjack of course). The governance rights here would have to do with guaranteeing some amount of liquidity depth to fulfill this function.\n\nSo assuming we roll these benefits into a capital layer, what governance rights are justifiable? So far we've got decisions about revenue flows as they relate to promises made to the capital layer, decisions over debasement of the capital layer, decisions over liquidity depth incentivization, and veto rights on certain actions that would put the capital layer at risk determined by their special functions. If you wish to use capital for Sybil resistance you might also end up using the capital layer for DAO value alignment although I think that's a pitfall in the long run. Outside of governance the capital layer should probably have rights to the treasury of the DAO in the event the DAO dissolves (DGX) or a no-confidence vote is required (several DAOs have rage-quit rights built into their governance tokens e.g. YAM).\n\nWhat else can you think of? What other utility does the capital layer provide and what governance rights do you think that entitles it? I'm still mulling it over personally.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s an open question I&#39;d like to discuss. What, if any, rights should a capital layer in a DAO have? I&#39;ve warned about the plutocratic nature of DAOs we&#39;ve seen to date before in my <a href=\"http://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame\">Defi Governance Endgame</a> post. I&#39;ve called for <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/wavpny/daily_general_discussion_july_29_2022/ii3hpd0/?context=3\">separation of influence</a> on specific topics from capital on measures for which there are objective answers and that a deciding body can be held accountable for. I&#39;ve written about modular DAO designs and <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harnessing-collector-psychology-for-good\">Sybil resistance mechanisms</a>. All of the above implies that <strong>I believe</strong> capital currently has too much influence in DAO governance and a dystopian future awaits us if we don&#39;t find a way to reduce that influence.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s not actually saying very much though because the capital layer in todays DAOs largely has the final say on <strong>everything</strong> with the only veto power available at all being the multi-sig signers. So if you don&#39;t think capital should have <em>absolute authority</em> over the DAO you basically should agree with me that as DAOs are structured today, the influence of capital should be reduced. I think this can also make DAOs more effective, even at generating revenue, by forming more autonomous specialist modules with technocratic interaction with the capital layer. However, looking at it from the other direction, why does a capital layer exist at all and if it should exist what influence is correct for it to have over a DAO?</p>\n\n<p>To answer that we can consider an organization (company or DAO) without a token but with some fungible non-transferrable voting influence. So, no capital layer because influence can&#39;t be bought or sold (ignoring bribes). What is this organization missing or what can&#39;t it do because of the absence of a capital layer?</p>\n\n<p>There are some things that seem to be unaffected by this change. Presumably influence would still be redistributed based on the contributions of its members over time. The influence over each decision can be as granular as the organization wants. You can have divisions or modules of the DAO each of which has its own influence distribution and you can have delegation between those modules <a href=\"https://idogrants.org/2018/04/20/how-to-use-a-r-a-s-i-c-roles-accountability-and-responsibility-matrix/\">RASIC</a> style. Modules can still be accountable based on the distribution of revenue without needing a tradable governance token. So, the capital layer doesn&#39;t significantly affect the ability to organize the contributors and hold them accountable to the value alignment layer of the organization. In short, work can still be done, people can still be paid directly from revenue or a treasury, and of course the DAO can still vote, all without capital involved in voting itself.</p>\n\n<p>So what is missing?

If the DAI in the PSM is sold for ETH then there is now DAI that is originated outside of a vault that isn't backed by a stablecoin. If the ETH value falls then the ETH in the PSM would need to be auctioned off to prevent DAI insolvency.
