So again they can&#39;t detect censoring on a private filled transaction and difficult to say if a public transaction has been omitted because the Builder prioritised his private mempool or because he censored this transaction.</p></li>\n<li><p>Validator must trust the Relayers in their active analysis.\nI don&#39;t get how to fully trust Relayers since even Relay can&#39;t be certain if censorship is really happening. Plus there is no incentive except reputation on Relays, so again it falls back on Validator analysis to conclude which Relay is best to use. Misinformation can be stronger than hard-to-prove analysis and lead stakers to choose a bad Relay.</p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;The buck stops with validators, like with most things.&quot;: Only if they are economically incentivized to do so! If a censoring Builder have a superior MeV algorithm, or is willing to give up much fees, or even loose money with negative commission (if that&#39;s possible), they could easily acquires a monopoly or at least building a majority of blocks. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So yeah even in the worst situation if some benevolent validators are still around, a censored transaction might ultimately come through. But without very clear and enforceable rules, penalties and incentives we will converge to the worst situation. And that is not how I imagine a credibly neutral chain...</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\njust read that, and it confirms most of what I understood.\nI did not know PBS was useful for statelessness tho.\n<a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance\">https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-17 23:47:05","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-08-18 00:27:45","id":"ikrjl9r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wqg1hz","parent_id":"t1_ikpd9i4","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/mgr37","body":"How do we know if builders don't censor transaction then ?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How do we know if builders don&#39;t censor transaction then ?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-17 08:36:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iko31kk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wqg1hz","parent_id":"t1_iknv6jz","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Maswasnos","body":"There are 3 main components to Flashbots MEV-boost:\n\n1.

Just a \"hey, this is some decent resistance rising up here\" failure. Suggests we're not done with the 1450 zone yet. Bears will get a chance, likely failing themselves, before our next leg higher past 2150 into the 2500 zone.\n\nThe dollar is hinting at a fresh breakout, hopefully just to a lower high. Watch the 106.60 and 107.25 levels closely. If both break, it could go on a run.\n\nLikewise, VIX has been getting absolutely pulverized for weeks and weeks. It's been glorious. But VIX doesn't like to stay down that long. It's at key support level 20 and rounding out a bottom. If it can stay above 20 and head back up, another spike could be due -- likely the one that induces the market retrace.\n\nLastly, folks who've read my updates know that the HYG high-yield corporate bonds have guided us *every. step. of. the. way.* during this bear.

It could signal that retrace back to S&P 4000 is en route.\n\nOn the docket for today is retail sales and FOMC minutes. Retail will be bad, but like the other metrics this summer, it will depend on how bad. Consensus seems to be a paltry 0.1-0.2%; any better and it helps the bottom printing. Meanwhile we'll get the notes from the July FOMC and see how the Fed governors are speaking about inflation data and rate hikes.

But I've kind of managed to finally clear up my thinking about this tornado situation.\n\nI'm fine with not fighting country-dependent frontend censorship, that ship has sailed decades ago, unfortunately. I'm not fine with going after developers of open-source code. At the same time, developers need to be more careful and try to distance themselves, like try not to profit if possible, because governments are going to be bullies if they have any leverage. Still, this is far from over, I hope some dutch court is going to bitch-slap the authorities.\n\nAs for the protocol level censorship, it is a complete no-go in my eyes. If it happens, Ethereum is dead. Not because of losing privacy, but because then it has bowed to government power, and if that happens once, it's going to happen again, so basically we are back to the start, with worse privacy.\n\nIf a minority of block builders won't include certain transactions that's fine. If they can force the chain to censor them (not validating blocks with the txes) that's not fine.\n\nIf the community starts accepting compromises like that, then they can chip away at everything little by little. This needs to be the hill that Ethereum is willing to die on. Either ban the whole network, or deal with no censorship. Going against the US like this is of course risky, a full ban is entirely possible. So far crypto has mostly flown under the radar in this regard, building influence, so now is kind of the time to use that influence to say \"we are too big now, you can't ban us\" and see what happens.\n\nI'm not sure however that we have the technical tools to say that? The government can easily go after big pools. The majority being outside the US is not enough, the governments are all going to happily join this initiative. The only way to achieve it is to have the majority power with small stakers who are hidden in a tor-like fashion and have to be tracked down individually. I'm not sure we are anywhere near that.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ok, so these things might have been already said a hundred times in the past week for all I know, I haven&#39;t followed the discussion closely enough. But I&#39;ve kind of managed to finally clear up my thinking about this tornado situation.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m fine with not fighting country-dependent frontend censorship, that ship has sailed decades ago, unfortunately. I&#39;m not fine with going after developers of open-source code. At the same time, developers need to be more careful and try to distance themselves, like try not to profit if possible, because governments are going to be bullies if they have any leverage. Still, this is far from over, I hope some dutch court is going to bitch-slap the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>As for the protocol level censorship, it is a complete no-go in my eyes. If it happens, Ethereum is dead. Not because of losing privacy, but because then it has bowed to government power, and if that happens once, it&#39;s going to happen again, so basically we are back to the start, with worse privacy.</p>\n\n<p>If a minority of block builders won&#39;t include certain transactions that&#39;s fine. If they can force the chain to censor them (not validating blocks with the txes) that&#39;s not fine.</p>\n\n<p>If the community starts accepting compromises like that, then they can chip away at everything little by little. This needs to be the hill that Ethereum is willing to die on. Either ban the whole network, or deal with no censorship. Going against the US like this is of course risky, a full ban is entirely possible. So far crypto has mostly flown under the radar in this regard, building influence, so now is kind of the time to use that influence to say &quot;we are too big now, you can&#39;t ban us&quot; and see what happens.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure however that we have the technical tools to say that? The government can easily go after big pools. The majority being outside the US is not enough, the governments are all going to happily join this initiative. The only way to achieve it is to have the majority power with small stakers who are hidden in a tor-like fashion and have to be tracked down individually.
