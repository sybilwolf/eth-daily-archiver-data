And what I feel is the entire point I'm trying to argue here.\n\nI advocate for sidelining censorship, because censorship is a consensus attack and has to be sidelined for the consensus to keep being uncoerced and to fulfill its task. \n\nBut I'm not the only one arguing for it. It's the designated defense mechanism against consensus attacks in Ethereum PoS. \n\nBesides, they're sidelined from one chain. But it still fully preserves self-sovereignty: anyone is free to join them and, if they're good enough, there's reason to believe many people use their chain. All crypto ensures is that they can't force people into their chain, which would be an illegitimate goal anyway. \n\n>Parents have authority over children. Regulation have authority over the people living under them.\n\nYou're highlighting the very problem of state-enforced regulations: we are children, in the sense that we are devoided of responsibilities and of our consent, even though we're supposed to fulfill our responsibilities in the most important task of a democracy: voting. It's a complete non sense and hypocrisy. Either we're responsible enough to be self-sovereign or we're not responsible enough to vote. But it can't be both. \n\n>I don't think that's fundamentally incompatible with an ideal world.\n\nIt is, because such regulation is a state enforced one, not a consentful one. And that creates lots of misaligned incentives all around, that we're suffering from for generations.\n\n>You still have to drive on the correct side of the road, and that in no way leads to slavery. It's just an aid for creating a more efficient, practical and safe society.\n\nIrrelevant, as it doesn't require a state-enforced regulation at all. All it requires is a consensus about one or more interface(s) people follow simply because people managing roads decide it's such interfaces that have to be followed on the roads they manage. Nothing else.\n\n>Of course there is bad regulation too, but even that is still far away from slavery imo.\n\nRegardless of the treatment and well-being of slaves, someone being forced to follow a regulation regardless of their consent is called slavery: it's someone ordered to behave however someone else sees fit.\n\n>I'm trying to convince you not to exclude people from the discussion beforehand.\n\nThey're not excluded. Anyone who attacks the consensus will be forked away because it's how a decentralized chain reacts to a consensus attack. But it's regardless of the fact they're regulators or anyone else. And they can still come back at any time into the chain, by buying back tokens with more funds. \n\n>People can still be excluded if the community wants to, even if the actual usage of the chain is permissionless.\n\nNo, only behaviors can be excluded. People can't be excluded, precisely because it is permissionless. \n\n>That is an ideal world to me as well. And I think it is achievable with regulation.\n\nA consentful world and state-enforced regulations are both excludable by design, because state-enforced regulations means consent is disregarded. \n\n>I think some countries are doing quite a good job already.\n\nThe only countries which have done a good job have either relied on killing lots of innocent strangers to dominate the market (the US, for instance) or have spent way more than they earn, notably by exploiting their own natural resources in an unsustainable way (like several northern European countries). That's far from a good job by my own standards, but we may have different standards.\n\n>And if you also make scams more easily caught, it makes them less profitable too. And that is something that cooperation with regulation could help with.\n\nExcept that such regulations have also helped scams have more easily access to cheap data to perform their scams. Lots of data enforced by regulations have been stolen over time. It's not stolen just for fun, it's been used by hackers and scammers worldwide to steal funds and identities, as well as to blackmail people.\n\n>But if that individual is a regulator with good ideas about how to make blockchain crime more easily caught, then they speak from a place of more knowledge and experience. People should all have a say, but some people have more value to add when they speak, so they should be listened to more.\n\nThey should be listened to more, I agree with that. If anything because they have more experience in all their own failures, which is in itself a pretty good insight. But that only means they can talk and anyone is able to listen and can decide for themselves to listen or not. Even if people should listen, no one would argue they should be forced to listen and, as such, are entitled to listen just as much as they want. \n\nBut let's not forget regulators should also be challenged much, much more. That's because they need to be providing very convincing arguments to show they have a point, way more than casual people. That's at least the Bayesian perspective on experts: if an expert doesn't have clear and solid arguments to support their claims, despite having spent lots of efforts to find such arguments, then applying Bayes to that model dictates you should expect either that any solid argument supporting such claim would require even more efforts to find or that there is no such argument to be found at all.

And what I feel is the entire point I&#39;m trying to argue here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I advocate for sidelining censorship, because censorship is a consensus attack and has to be sidelined for the consensus to keep being uncoerced and to fulfill its task. </p>\n\n<p>But I&#39;m not the only one arguing for it. It&#39;s the designated defense mechanism against consensus attacks in Ethereum PoS. </p>\n\n<p>Besides, they&#39;re sidelined from one chain. But it still fully preserves self-sovereignty: anyone is free to join them and, if they&#39;re good enough, there&#39;s reason to believe many people use their chain. All crypto ensures is that they can&#39;t force people into their chain, which would be an illegitimate goal anyway. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Parents have authority over children. Regulation have authority over the people living under them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re highlighting the very problem of state-enforced regulations: we are children, in the sense that we are devoided of responsibilities and of our consent, even though we&#39;re supposed to fulfill our responsibilities in the most important task of a democracy: voting. It&#39;s a complete non sense and hypocrisy. Either we&#39;re responsible enough to be self-sovereign or we&#39;re not responsible enough to vote. But it can&#39;t be both. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fundamentally incompatible with an ideal world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is, because such regulation is a state enforced one, not a consentful one. And that creates lots of misaligned incentives all around, that we&#39;re suffering from for generations.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You still have to drive on the correct side of the road, and that in no way leads to slavery. It&#39;s just an aid for creating a more efficient, practical and safe society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Irrelevant, as it doesn&#39;t require a state-enforced regulation at all. All it requires is a consensus about one or more interface(s) people follow simply because people managing roads decide it&#39;s such interfaces that have to be followed on the roads they manage. Nothing else.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of course there is bad regulation too, but even that is still far away from slavery imo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regardless of the treatment and well-being of slaves, someone being forced to follow a regulation regardless of their consent is called slavery: it&#39;s someone ordered to behave however someone else sees fit.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m trying to convince you not to exclude people from the discussion beforehand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They&#39;re not excluded. Anyone who attacks the consensus will be forked away because it&#39;s how a decentralized chain reacts to a consensus attack. But it&#39;s regardless of the fact they&#39;re regulators or anyone else. And they can still come back at any time into the chain, by buying back tokens with more funds. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>People can still be excluded if the community wants to, even if the actual usage of the chain is permissionless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, only behaviors can be excluded. People can&#39;t be excluded, precisely because it is permissionless. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That is an ideal world to me as well. And I think it is achievable with regulation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A consentful world and state-enforced regulations are both excludable by design, because state-enforced regulations means consent is disregarded. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think some countries are doing quite a good job already.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only countries which have done a good job have either relied on killing lots of innocent strangers to dominate the market (the US, for instance) or have spent way more than they earn, notably by exploiting their own natural resources in an unsustainable way (like several northern European countries). That&#39;s far from a good job by my own standards, but we may have different standards.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if you also make scams more easily caught, it makes them less profitable too. And that is something that cooperation with regulation could help with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Except that such regulations have also helped scams have more easily access to cheap data to perform their scams. Lots of data enforced by regulations have been stolen over time. It&#39;s not stolen just for fun, it&#39;s been used by hackers and scammers worldwide to steal funds and identities, as well as to blackmail people.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if that individual is a regulator with good ideas about how to make blockchain crime more easily caught, then they speak from a place of more knowledge and experience. People should all have a say, but some people have more value to add when they speak, so they should be listened to more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They should be listened to more, I agree with that. If anything because they have more experience in all their own failures, which is in itself a pretty good insight. But that only means they can talk and anyone is able to listen and can decide for themselves to listen or not. Even if people should listen, no one would argue they should be forced to listen and, as such, are entitled to listen just as much as they want. </p>\n\n<p>But let&#39;s not forget regulators should also be challenged much, much more. That&#39;s because they need to be providing very convincing arguments to show they have a point, way more than casual people.

There is lots of regulation on which over 90% of the population is aligned. And some basic social rules and structures help society function. \n\nThat's not what I refered to. I was talking about aligned incentives, not aligned people. Besides, 90% of people being on par with your rules means 10% of people are enslaved. To my standards, that's unacceptable barbarism. \n\nIf these regulations are so good and so much accepted by everyone, then there would be no need to state-enforce them in the first place. And that's actually where most efficient regulations exist: without state enforcement. Through labelling and interfaces between individuals as well as between businesses. \n\n>My ideal world is not one completely devoid of rules.\n\nMine neither. They're just consented rules. The ones people decide to follow. On top of being respectful of others, it ensures it's way easier to enforce these rules, as you end up in a non adversarial environment, rather in a cooperative environment. \n\n>But I think in most cases a government distributing the rules is the clearest way to consensus. There needs to be some socially accepted rulebase.\n\nThe required rule base is way, way smaller than what any government monopolizes. The only rule base you'd technically need is a property concept and that people accept not to trespass properties (including the most basic one, self-ownership) if they're not accepted. And that rule base only requires one consensus, nothing more. Anything else can be handled by custom laws designed by each individual for oneself, with a consented coercion they decide about for themselves. To have this as a decentralized entity, you'd then need to use layers of power balance to ensure no specific consented coercion service provider becomes too big and a threat rather than a service. But that's just services themselves, the ruling basis still is tiny. \n\nSo, no, clearly, all you need is just one consensus of property ownership as a base rule. Nothing else. \n\n>And in our current world the most efficient and simple way to get there is through a central state sharing these rules.\n\nNo, the most efficient way is through a decentralized consensus. A central state creates lots of misaligned incentives and a monopoly of unconsented coercion that has, by definition, no way to be refrained from getting more and more power until totalitarianism becomes the norm, generally ending in violence and blood, either decades later or only a few years later if we're really lucky. \n\nActually, it's happened so many times with so many civilizations it's hard to see so many people keep a blind eye on this. It's as if most people were just hoping to give away the problem to their own children (what a gift /s ), just because they're too lazy to think a bit and come up with a solution. \n\n>Forming concensus among millions of people without any form of regulation is much harder.\n\nYou're literally in a sub about exactly that. The base rule is so tiny it's not that hard to come up with it. All the rest can be handled completely individually to let people decide whether they want to cooperate or they want to agree to disagree and keep their distance from each others. \n\n>You can just call it irrelevant, but it would be nicer if you could give an alternative to a government to create social consensus that actually works in the real world, and that we can replace current government based regulation with.\n\nWell, I did it, it seems. Please, ask if there's any detail you feel is lacking or unclear. I haven't detailed much at all and it's a very weird concept for many people, as it completely reverses a dependency many people have been accustomed to only think about in a single way. \n\n>Unless the consensus is in agreement with the state and supports the regulation in question.\n\nSpecifically supporting a regulation means having a state, aka a centralized entity, deciding what each consensus actor has to do, requiring from them to collude into following such regulation. \n\n>You're very adamant about any type of regulation or law being unconsented.\n\nNo, I'm very adamant about any type of state-enforced regulation or state-enforced law being unconsented. Regulations and laws can be modeled and applied in a consentful way, but if it needs a monopoly of unconsented coercion, aka a state, then it's unconsented regulations and laws.\n\n>There are lots of laws that have the consent from the people.\n\nFrom most people. Not from the people. That means there are people who didn't consent. You're sacrificing them. You'd get it if you were very regularly part of the sacrificed ones. \n\n>Democracy doesn't work ideally everywhere, but it has lead to democratically elected officials putting laws in place that the population in that country consents with. \n\nNot unanimously. Or else, it wouldn't have needed to be enforced in the first place. Just like many customs never need to be enforced. \n\n>A law or regulation doesn't fundamentally destroy consensus.\n\nSure, I agree with that. A state-enforced one does, though.\n\n>But you think the only option for true decentralisation is to make sure you comply with no regulation at all, in none of the existing countries? In a way that completely binds you to regulation too, just in the opposite way.\n\nNo, what I'm saying is that if consensus actors act in collusion to comply with a centralized entity, then it's a centralized network that needs to fork away its consensus actors. Such collusion, notably censorship, is pretty hard to come up with. It takes effort in coordination. It's not something that easily slips through. \n\nIf the centralized entity just describes what consensus actors are already doing, then sure, consensus actors are technically \"complying\", but they're not colluding in any way. There's no coordinated effort to attack the network.\n\nSo, no, it's not about making sure you always do the opposite of what cebtralized entities ask. It's about not colluding to get a coordinated attack of the network.\n\n>\"There is a lot of money on the table for the first western country that gets this right.\"\n\nAnd that, to you, doesn't ring any bell at all?

Me and Rocket are close but his sister, Eudora\u2026 well \u2026 if you\u2019ve grown up and lived with dogs you\u2019ll understand this \u2026 Eudora crawled deep into my heart, made a bed and curled up in my soul. When she passed a part of me was lost with her. I\u2019ve had dogs my whole life but she was special.\n\nIts a long beautiful story, but I loved her as much or more than most people. A part of Rocket died that day too. It was a crushing blow to my pack. As I sit here on the edge of losing another one of my pack I want to tell this story. It is 100% true, and to this day I can\u2019t explain it. I have never told anyone this for fear of appearing crazier than I already do. Not even my wife. Figure there\u2019s not much to lose with y\u2019all on that front tho.\n\nWhen Eudora passed I cried for days. Every morning, every time I got up from the desk, every night before bed. I was inconsolable. I isolated myself in the one place that has always brought me solace. I hiked alone deep into the Rockies to spread Eudora\u2019s ashes in our favorite spot. A spot we both loved and enjoyed many times before Rocket was born. This spot is miles away from the trailhead, down an overgrown path and despite visiting this place numerous times, I had never seen another person there, ever. It was quite literally \u201cour spot.\u201d\n\nWhile I was crying, hands shaking, trying to spread her ashes in her favorite place \u2026 I heard a woman\u2019s voice from behind me. *If you love her let her go, its only then that she can carry on. Shes not gone she\u2019s become a part of you.* I turned to look at this woman, but there was no one there. Normally I\u2019d think that was odd but I was heartbroken so I chalked it up to grief, lack of sleep and food. I hiked all the way back without seeing or hearing another person.\n\nAs soon as I got home I crashed hard. This is where it gets really weird guys. In the middle of the night I awoke to the sound of Eudora\u2019s toenails on the hard wood. *Clickity clickity clicky* I could recognize her gait and clicks anywhere. I laid awake trying to determine if I was losing my mind or if I was dreaming. Steps getting closer. Too real to be a dream.\n\nJust then I feel her land at my feet on the bed. Eudora hasn\u2019t been able to get on the bed in years. I was too scared to see what had climbed into the bed with me, but I didn\u2019t have to, she approached and nuzzled my head to wake me, as she had done every morning for the last 13 years. I opened my eyes and for a moment my heart stopped as my eyes met hers and she laid down next to me and nuzzled her head into my chin and I petted her, as I had done every morning for the last 13 years and I cried \u2026 and she consoled me and rubbed her head on my face to dry my tears, as she had done every time I cried for the last 13 years.\n\nI wept and petted her for what seemed like hours until I fell asleep. It was so real, the sights, sounds, even the smells. Perfectly accurate, perfection unworthy of a dream or fabrication of the mind. I awoke to find her not there obviously, but I was shook. I decided to hike back to the spot where I had put her to rest, think, ponder, meditate on what I had experienced.\n\nI laid there for a while with my eyes closed listening to the wind blow through the trees \u2026 then that voice came again *They only come back when your love is so strong it transcends worlds. She\u2019s ok. You\u2019re a good boy John, and she loves you more than anything*\n\nThis time I didn\u2019t bother to look and the voice disappeared into the sound of the wind through the trees. I fell asleep there and woke up a few hours later. I hiked back home, packed up and left the next morning, and never spoke to anyone about this ever. Now guys I don\u2019t believe in ghosts but I have never been able to explain this to myself and I have never told anyone about it until today\u2026 but I hope, no pray, she\u2019s with my buddy rn, rubbing her head on him, consoling him. I really hope it wasn\u2019t a dream, because it kills me to think he\u2019s there all alone rn and I might not ever get to see him ever again.\n\nWhoever you pray to, I would be grateful them right now.\n\n*You win life!

I hiked all the way back without seeing or hearing another person.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I got home I crashed hard. This is where it gets really weird guys. In the middle of the night I awoke to the sound of Eudora\u2019s toenails on the hard wood. <em>Clickity clickity clicky</em> I could recognize her gait and clicks anywhere. I laid awake trying to determine if I was losing my mind or if I was dreaming. Steps getting closer. Too real to be a dream.</p>\n\n<p>Just then I feel her land at my feet on the bed. Eudora hasn\u2019t been able to get on the bed in years. I was too scared to see what had climbed into the bed with me, but I didn\u2019t have to, she approached and nuzzled my head to wake me, as she had done every morning for the last 13 years. I opened my eyes and for a moment my heart stopped as my eyes met hers and she laid down next to me and nuzzled her head into my chin and I petted her, as I had done every morning for the last 13 years and I cried \u2026 and she consoled me and rubbed her head on my face to dry my tears, as she had done every time I cried for the last 13 years.</p>\n\n<p>I wept and petted her for what seemed like hours until I fell asleep. It was so real, the sights, sounds, even the smells. Perfectly accurate, perfection unworthy of a dream or fabrication of the mind. I awoke to find her not there obviously, but I was shook. I decided to hike back to the spot where I had put her to rest, think, ponder, meditate on what I had experienced.</p>\n\n<p>I laid there for a while with my eyes closed listening to the wind blow through the trees \u2026 then that voice came again <em>They only come back when your love is so strong it transcends worlds. She\u2019s ok. You\u2019re a good boy John, and she loves you more than anything</em></p>\n\n<p>This time I didn\u2019t bother to look and the voice disappeared into the sound of the wind through the trees. I fell asleep there and woke up a few hours later. I hiked back home, packed up and left the next morning, and never spoke to anyone about this ever. Now guys I don\u2019t believe in ghosts but I have never been able to explain this to myself and I have never told anyone about it until today\u2026 but I hope, no pray, she\u2019s with my buddy rn, rubbing her head on him, consoling him. I really hope it wasn\u2019t a dream, because it kills me to think he\u2019s there all alone rn and I might not ever get to see him ever again.</p>\n\n<p>Whoever you pray to, I would be grateful them right now.</p>\n\n<p><em>You win life! Mercy! Please!</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-20 05:44:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"il26v1a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wsypnj","parent_id":"t3_wsypnj","score":30,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"That's rough, my friend.
