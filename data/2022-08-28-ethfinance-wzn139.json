As a NFT collectooor, I&#39;m pleased to announce <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redditfanclub\">a new Twitter account</a> to discuss all things related to Reddit Collectible Avatars. I think it&#39;s a really fun project that will massively help with onboarding normies into our ecosystem; I&#39;ve already seen multiple people change their mind about NFTs because of their avatar. Feel free to follow if you want to take part in this brand new adventure!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-28 14:08:05","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-08-28 14:11:13","id":"im6cix8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wzn139","parent_id":"t3_wzn139","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nitter_not_twitter","body":"[a new Twitter account](https://nitter.net/redditfanclub)  \n\n ^(I'm a bot | )[^(Why & About)](https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&subject=Opt+Out&message=optout)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://nitter.net/redditfanclub\">a new Twitter account</a>  </p>\n\n<p><sup>I&#39;m a bot | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/\"><sup>Why &amp; About</sup></a><sup> | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&amp;subject=Opt+Out&amp;message=optout\"><sup>Opt Out</sup></a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-28 14:08:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"im6ckfo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wzn139","parent_id":"t1_im6cix8","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/icevermin","body":"Wtf is this \"TTD\" on ultrasound.money","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wtf is this &quot;TTD&quot; on ultrasound.money</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-28 14:01:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"im6bnkt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wzn139","parent_id":"t3_wzn139","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/bagogel12","body":"Terminal Total Difficulty","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Terminal Total Difficulty</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-28 14:06:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"im6c957","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_wzn139","parent_id":"t1_im6bnkt","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/icevermin","body":"I'm a little out of the loop.
