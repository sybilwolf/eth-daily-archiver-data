They aren't capital efficient like USDC or FRAX. Their DAO is opaque, cumbersome, and dominated by a few whales. There's nothing that defines them any more except that RWA program which frankly just never got off the ground outside of a few deals. And now, they might scrap that for reasons that I could have spelled out for them in 2020 before they adopted USDC for peg stability.

I've posted some pieces about the rights of the capital layer, the separation of influence from tokens, technocratic sub-DAO structures using bonded KPIs (key performance indicator) for influence redistribution, etc. Part of that work may go into funding some new technologies like Snapshot or Coordinape to be the basis of some DAO 2.0 tech stacks.\n\nSorry for rambling.

In the case of Frax governance exists, and some things are certainly debated, but overall it seems like Sam is really the one steering the DAO in a specific direction, and holders seem generally aligned in following his vision for the protocol. Reflexer and Liquity are of course the latter.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a shame, because as someone unhappy with the state of government in the US, I\u2019ve always been hopeful that crypto will eventually find a better model or improvements through experimentation. So far that hasn\u2019t been the case, and developments here have been underwhelming. It feels like we\u2019re increasingly seeing cases of governance acting more like a bug than a feature. I\u2019m holding out hope that strides in sybil resistance and identity solutions will eventually make a difference here, but it doesn\u2019t fix all the organizational challenges we\u2019ve seen, or address the question of whether a truly decentralized governance system will ever be efficient enough to compete, or be worth the difficulties it introduces.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-08-29 23:42:17","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-08-29 23:55:12","id":"imcuzix","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_x1a70t","parent_id":"t1_imcqv95","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Some time I'd like to have a discussion with you on that last paragraph.
