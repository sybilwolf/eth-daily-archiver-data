You're expected to act like an adult but you're treated like a child. You have no control over anything but are expected to act as if you do. The computer has to obey and it allowed me to flex my lil' muscle. It was an ego trip. What they're missing? An outlet for all that angst and rage. Give them control over things in their lives. Let them mess up, help them fix it, give them control again! Later as an adult it became about money ... which really is just the grown up version of power and control.\n\n> One of my most dystopic predictions for 2050 (or maybe its a utopic prediction -- I don't know?) foresees bio-implants put into young boys to throttle their body's creation of testosterone.

It would be the Mother of all Culture Wars.  Yikes!  It would be great if it never comes to that.\n\nScary. Reminds me of the movie [Equilibrium](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238380/) where the government forces everyone to take emotion suppressing drugs. I hope that it doesn't come to that, but I suppose it could. I don't think the problem is testosterone unless the levels are extremely high. For young people in their teens hormones levels fluctuate all over the place and suppressing medically is doing them a disservice. Long term developmental and health effects will likely occur. Teach them to control them instead.\n\nIMO, the problem is no one focuses on mindfulness. All these feelings, emotions, anxiety, depression can all be overcome by training the mind. Meditation. Introspection. Surrender. Talking. Normalizing. Of course, that's a bunch of horseshit in the western world, so we drug people instead. I suffered from all sorts of stuff and I controlled it for a time with drugs, but they cause more problems than they fix long term. Occasionally I still am forced to control them with drugs, but for the most part I am mind over matter.\n\nI could rant for days about all of societies problems but I will spare you all.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/u/REALJohnBMacLemore\">u/REALJohnBMacLemore</a>, sometimes I get a sinking feeling in the pit of my gut that testosterone-driven hackers threaten to be the downfall of every good thing we are imagining from the digital future, including web3.

What are they missing in their life or their view of their future possibilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t speak for them all but for me it was a control thing. Power. At that age, everything is weird. You&#39;re expected to act like an adult but you&#39;re treated like a child. You have no control over anything but are expected to act as if you do. The computer has to obey and it allowed me to flex my lil&#39; muscle. It was an ego trip. What they&#39;re missing? An outlet for all that angst and rage. Give them control over things in their lives. Let them mess up, help them fix it, give them control again! Later as an adult it became about money ... which really is just the grown up version of power and control.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of my most dystopic predictions for 2050 (or maybe its a utopic prediction -- I don&#39;t know?) foresees bio-implants put into young boys to throttle their body&#39;s creation of testosterone. At first it&#39;ll be voluntary by parents, but then, because politics is downstream of culture, I can foresee stronger mandates pushing all families that way. It would be the Mother of all Culture Wars.  Yikes!  It would be great if it never comes to that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Scary. Reminds me of the movie <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238380/\">Equilibrium</a> where the government forces everyone to take emotion suppressing drugs. I hope that it doesn&#39;t come to that, but I suppose it could. I don&#39;t think the problem is testosterone unless the levels are extremely high. For young people in their teens hormones levels fluctuate all over the place and suppressing medically is doing them a disservice. Long term developmental and health effects will likely occur. Teach them to control them instead.</p>\n\n<p>IMO, the problem is no one focuses on mindfulness. All these feelings, emotions, anxiety, depression can all be overcome by training the mind. Meditation. Introspection. Surrender. Talking. Normalizing. Of course, that&#39;s a bunch of horseshit in the western world, so we drug people instead. I suffered from all sorts of stuff and I controlled it for a time with drugs, but they cause more problems than they fix long term. Occasionally I still am forced to control them with drugs, but for the most part I am mind over matter.</p>\n\n<p>I could rant for days about all of societies problems but I will spare you all.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-11 12:52:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"io14n2d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xb9pyq","parent_id":"t1_io0ib87","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/OyuruKemono","body":">What they're missing?
