I don't actually care about the NFT part of it or some digital experience that comes with it. I somehow doubt that whatever smooth jazz lounge comes with my NFT is going to rival me just watching Bankless or writing to you all. I do however care that Starbucks is going to maintain a web3 wallet using your Starbucks login credentials just like exchanges do and apparently do fee abstraction for their users (\"No crypto wallet or cryptocurrency will be required\"). That account is already linked to a credit card so it's another fiat on-ramp even if it is one-way. It's not much further to add receiving web3 payment to charge your account balance. With a wallet already in place for their users from this NFT program it's much closer.\n\nWhy do I care? Well, banks offer Two-Way Flows. Because they can receive money and transmit it on your behalf they need a lot more legal compliance such as money-transmitter licenses. Loyalty programs are One-Way Flows. This reduces their legal and financial complexity substantially. Lowering the legal compliance enables many more of them to proliferate, and once companies adopt it, much harder to regulate out of existence. Any given country might have tens of banks and as a result it's very easy to shut down crypto at the banking layer if they want to be hostile. Compare this to potentially thousands of companies with their loyalty programs. That allows for death by a thousand cuts.\n\nImagine that you are crypto-rich and in a hostile country with capital controls. Maybe you're in a place like Argentina that wants you to hold a currency with 100% inflation. Or maybe you're in the US in 20 years and our monetary policy goes belly-up. Either way, you want to use your crypto without touching a bank. How do you live off your crypto?\n\nOption 1, something like the Nexo credit card that let's you repay your debt using tokens. There are already banks that accept USDC deposits, it's not much further to have one of those banks offer a credit card or for a bank that already does to accept USDC deposits. Now, if you're in Argentina, they would have to shut down the credit card rails as well.\n\nOption 2, each company creates a loyalty program that can receive web3 deposits and be spent from at their store. It's all cafeteria lunch card style but the result is still that you can spend your crypto to live on without having to go through a bank or a Visa credit rail. Go to your grocery store and buy your groceries. Go to Starbucks and buy your coffee. Go to Walmart and buy some prepaid gift cards and credit cards. It's basically a crack in financial censorship's armor.\n\nTo the degree that you value financial freedom and protection from government corruption and bad monetary policy both of these options enable you to hold a currency of your choice and live off of it wherever you are. This doesn't enable you to buy a house or something but it could mean enough freedom to have a roof over your head and food in your belly in a time and place where oppression reigns.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This <a href=\"https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2022/starbucks-brewing-revolutionary-web3-experience-for-its-starbucks-rewards-members/\">Starbucks news</a> is interesting but not really for what they highlight in their press piece.

Maybe you&#39;re in a place like Argentina that wants you to hold a currency with 100% inflation. Or maybe you&#39;re in the US in 20 years and our monetary policy goes belly-up. Either way, you want to use your crypto without touching a bank. How do you live off your crypto?</p>\n\n<p>Option 1, something like the Nexo credit card that let&#39;s you repay your debt using tokens. There are already banks that accept USDC deposits, it&#39;s not much further to have one of those banks offer a credit card or for a bank that already does to accept USDC deposits. Now, if you&#39;re in Argentina, they would have to shut down the credit card rails as well.</p>\n\n<p>Option 2, each company creates a loyalty program that can receive web3 deposits and be spent from at their store. It&#39;s all cafeteria lunch card style but the result is still that you can spend your crypto to live on without having to go through a bank or a Visa credit rail. Go to your grocery store and buy your groceries. Go to Starbucks and buy your coffee. Go to Walmart and buy some prepaid gift cards and credit cards. It&#39;s basically a crack in financial censorship&#39;s armor.</p>\n\n<p>To the degree that you value financial freedom and protection from government corruption and bad monetary policy both of these options enable you to hold a currency of your choice and live off of it wherever you are. This doesn&#39;t enable you to buy a house or something but it could mean enough freedom to have a roof over your head and food in your belly in a time and place where oppression reigns.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-12 09:47:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"io553n8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xc3ttm","parent_id":"t3_xc3ttm","score":47,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/reuptaken","body":"If country is really crypto hostile, it won't allow companies to sell loyalty programs points or issue such cards and top it up with crypto.

The signing key is never backed up with a seed phrase or any other method which is susceptible to theft.\n\n\\* There is a set of at least 3 (or a much higher number) of \"guardians\", of which a majority can cooperate to change the signing key of the account.\n\n\\* The signing key has the ability to add or remove guardians, though only after a delay (often 1-3 days).\r  \n\r  \nUnder all normal circumstances, the user can simply use their social recovery wallet like a regular wallet, signing messages with their signing key so that each transaction signed can fly off with a single confirmation click much like it would in a \"traditional\" wallet like Metamask.\r  \n\r  \nIf a user loses their signing key, instead of restoring from a seed phrase or a QR code or something else that could become a problem if it falls into the wrong hands, the user simply reaches out to their guardians and ask them to sign a special transaction to change the signing pubkey registered in the wallet contract to a new signing key. Guardians would simply go to a webpage such as security.loopring.io, sign in, see a recovery request and sign it. About as easy for each guardian as making a Uniswap trade.\r  \n\r  \nThere are many possible choices for whom to select as a guardian. The three most common choices are:\r  \n\r  \n\\* Other devices (or paper mnemonics) owned by the wallet holder themselves\n\n\\* Friends and family members\r\n\n\\* Institutions, which would sign a recovery message if they get a confirmation of your phone number or email or perhaps in high value cases verify you personally by video call\r\n\nGuardians are easy to add: you can add a guardian simply by typing in their ENS name or ETH address, though most social recovery wallets will require the guardian to sign a transaction in the recovery webpage to agree to be added. In any sanely designed social recovery wallet, the guardian does NOT need to download and use the same wallet; they can simply use their existing Ethereum wallet, whichever type of wallet it is. Given the high convenience of adding guardians, if you are lucky enough that your social circles are already made up of Ethereum users, I personally favor high guardian counts (ideally 7+) for increased security. If you already have a wallet, there is no ongoing mental effort required to be a guardian: any recovery operations that you do would be done through your existing wallet. If you not know many other active Ethereum users, then a smaller number of guardians that you trust to be technically competent is best.\r  \n\r  \nTo reduce the risk of attacks on guardians and collusion, your guardians do not have to be publicly known: in fact, they do not need to know each other's identities. This can be accomplished in two ways. First, instead of the guardians' addresses being stored directly on chain, a hash of the list of addresses can be stored on chain, and the wallet owner would only need to publish the full list at recovery time. Second, each guardian can be asked to deterministically generate a new single-purpose address that they would use just for that particular recovery; they would not need to actually send any transactions with that address unless a recovery is actually required. To complement these technical protections, it's recommended to choose a diverse collection of guardians from different social circles (including ideally one institutional guardian); these recommendations together would make it extremely difficult for the guardians to be attacked simultaneously or collude.\r  \n\r  \nIn the event that you die or are permanently incapacitated, it would be a socially agreed standard protocol that guardians can publicly announce themselves, so in that case they can find each other and recover your funds.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Social recovery is the best way for everyone to protect their wallet, and makes it easier for normies as it no longer requires storing a mnemonic, QR code, or a private key.</p>\n\n<p>A social recovery system works as follows:</p>\n\n<p>* There is a single &quot;signing key&quot; that can be used to approve transactions. The signing key is never backed up with a seed phrase or any other method which is susceptible to theft.</p>\n\n<p>* There is a set of at least 3 (or a much higher number) of &quot;guardians&quot;, of which a majority can cooperate to change the signing key of the account.</p>\n\n<p>* The signing key has the ability to add or remove guardians, though only after a delay (often 1-3 days).</p>\n\n<p>Under all normal circumstances, the user can simply use their social recovery wallet like a regular wallet, signing messages with their signing key so that each transaction signed can fly off with a single confirmation click much like it would in a &quot;traditional&quot; wallet like Metamask.</p>\n\n<p>If a user loses their signing key, instead of restoring from a seed phrase or a QR code or something else that could become a problem if it falls into the wrong hands, the user simply reaches out to their guardians and ask them to sign a special transaction to change the signing pubkey registered in the wallet contract to a new signing key. Guardians would simply go to a webpage such as security.loopring.io, sign in, see a recovery request and sign it. About as easy for each guardian as making a Uniswap trade.</p>\n\n<p>There are many possible choices for whom to select as a guardian. The three most common choices are:</p>\n\n<p>* Other devices (or paper mnemonics) owned by the wallet holder themselves</p>\n\n<p>* Friends and family members</p>\n\n<p>* Institutions, which would sign a recovery message if they get a confirmation of your phone number or email or perhaps in high value cases verify you personally by video call</p>\n\n<p>Guardians are easy to add: you can add a guardian simply by typing in their ENS name or ETH address, though most social recovery wallets will require the guardian to sign a transaction in the recovery webpage to agree to be added. In any sanely designed social recovery wallet, the guardian does NOT need to download and use the same wallet; they can simply use their existing Ethereum wallet, whichever type of wallet it is. Given the high convenience of adding guardians, if you are lucky enough that your social circles are already made up of Ethereum users, I personally favor high guardian counts (ideally 7+) for increased security. If you already have a wallet, there is no ongoing mental effort required to be a guardian: any recovery operations that you do would be done through your existing wallet. If you not know many other active Ethereum users, then a smaller number of guardians that you trust to be technically competent is best.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce the risk of attacks on guardians and collusion, your guardians do not have to be publicly known: in fact, they do not need to know each other&#39;s identities. This can be accomplished in two ways. First, instead of the guardians&#39; addresses being stored directly on chain, a hash of the list of addresses can be stored on chain, and the wallet owner would only need to publish the full list at recovery time. Second, each guardian can be asked to deterministically generate a new single-purpose address that they would use just for that particular recovery; they would not need to actually send any transactions with that address unless a recovery is actually required.

If that happened, and we finalized an invalid chain, then we&#39;re in for a bunch of pain, since &gt;67% of validators would have to choose between being slashed, and being stuck in a massive exit queue that most of them couldn&#39;t get out of before they bled half of their stake and were kicked out. </p>\n\n<p>But even in this last case, there would be a correct minority chain that would continue chugging along and processing transactions, even if it didn&#39;t finalize. Users could keep using that one, and eventually the chain would be straightened out in the background.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-12 14:55:34","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-09-12 15:04:45","id":"io6eypl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xc3ttm","parent_id":"t1_io6dg3q","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"But what if the sun collapses during the merge, what\u2019s the plan then?

I never learned it in such a simple and accessible way so i want to share it with you (in graphs is way more of a headache but normally you learn it with graphs and equations).\n\nTo take something already away, I think this explaination will not change much the result of Ethereum but it shows why it's a valid point of critic for bitcoin even if the approach with halvings sound similar.\n\n\nMany learned, maybe in school, that if you print money it becomes less valuable. Well, to make it short - this is outdated theory. Friedmann was maybe the most prominent fan of this theory but it's outdated and only the Austrian economic school, a small subsection of liberalism, still believes in it. This is also where bitcoin originated from.\n\nSounds nice but the total amount of money doesn't matter. If you have \"more\" or \"less\" nobody cares. Its just a \"descriptive system variable\". It begins to matter when the new money is actively used to buy and request things from a company. Then they start to feel it. Like you see already in this example more effects play a role and nobody asked for the \"total sum of money\"\n\nIt gets more tricky but also more fun.\n\nNow with supply and demand you also learned in school how they react. Well also that was an absolute edge case that barely exists. It's called elasticity and what you hear only applies to 100% elastic demand, which pretty much never happen. Think about insulin - your demand is constant, always (demand inelastic). You can't buy less if the price is higher, you simply need it. Meanwhile land (as in soil/ground) is also inelastic but from a \"supply side\". You can't create ground, it's always constant (subtract rivers, mountains,...).\n\nSo now that we see that money is relevant on how it is used and how it can be spend, I will use it with a current example.\n\nRight now you have an inflation with some fun side effects. You have expensive energy (mostly gas driven with wars and incertainty) and its energy intensive products (food) and a disruption in supply chain with China lockdowns. Companies were limited in their output, so they were able to increase their prices (constant requests). Meanwhile they could not buy and spend money. So their earnings increased massively ( = more more money in but no money out). Quite a counterintuitive effect.\n\nNow that some might feel some tension with this new understanding regarding what they heared so far, time for some bitcoin bashing we like better.\n\nWell now it makes sense that the 21M doesn't really matter. Nobody will aks you how many bitcoins there are, to price you a service. The cost of service doesn't depend on the total supply. It's about usage. Same like you dont care how much others have insulin, you just want yours ( = your service).\n\nSome simplified this critic as \"the fee-market is unknown to work\" - but this sentence is still complex. They mean that once the 21M coins are out, the miners need to secure the network just by the fee of transactions. Maybe you see it again, it's about usage, not total coins.\n\nNow to Ethereum. Well this is more \"boring\", because it's more well thought through (who would have guessed?!).\n\nIt was built around usage and not around emissions. You pay for ethereum usage and the constant request for services. The service you request is now quite inelastic, you need it if you want to use Ethereum, otherwise why use it? Remember, people like to hold bitcoin because \"just up\" but don't need to spend it to have the benefits (\"price up\") of bitcoin. Just store it.\n\nSo if you need (like insulin) Ethereum which you will pay for pretty much everything you can do. Otherwise stick to bitcoin and just wait. That's where the usage comes into play. Obviously some large emissions made sense so far to launch the project over years, but in the long play that is something less relevant.\n\nSo if you emissions go down and those who use the network need to still continuously spend some eth, yes then the price can go up. Those who don't use the network and just store it bitcoin style will reduce the effect. If the network gets abonded like ETH-pow we will see that deflation will not save them. They can half and quarter the total amount, but it's about usage and requesting services.\n\n\nSo this is the big difference why emissions (inflation) and deflation isn't always the same. Obviously reality is more complex that one is good and one is bad. Now we saw a bit why.\n\nThis is just a small part of the huge theory of it. For nations it's more complex as it's also in trust (gov securities) and what covers the believes for the future\n\nI hoped you liked the more \"visual\" explainations, because so far most crypto YouTube stuff i saw is either more business economics (like micro) or already with equations and graphs with macroeconomics. This discussion  tends to become tense (bitcoin!), given people defend the basis principle they heard, so I found these daily life examples accessible. Downside is thought if you want to defend the other side you can find counter-expamles, which is why many explain and derive the equations.\n\nMaybe there are even better examples, I piped everything together as best as I can. Let me know if you can rephrase it better/simpler or have good visual examples!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This week I learned something about inflation and deflation from an economic perspective.
