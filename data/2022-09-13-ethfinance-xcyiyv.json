Results are pretty dry as there just isn't much innovation going on here. Please do correct me if I'm wrong on some point (I haven't looked at this before today). SuperRare launched their token around August 2021. The whole premise of their launch was to decentralize the curation process. Instead of having a single storefront they have a set of spaces (currently 21 with more being added by their \u201cspace race\u201d program). Each space is a unique art gallery with its own NFT minting contract. The token holders vote on the set of space operators. The space operator and the DAO get a fee on NFT sale volume. The space operators set their own commission structure defaulted to 10% plus the DAO receives a 5% commission.\n\nTaking data from [here](https://dune.com/rchen8/superrare_4), volume has significantly decreased this year. Total volume YTD is approximately $50M compared to $200M the previous year. Revenue from this volume depends on sale type. Primary sales take a 15% cut which is split 10% to the space operator and 5% to the community treasury. Secondary sales only take a 2% network fee which goes to the community treasury. The community treasury is managed by a 7 person governance council appointed by token holders which act as a multi-sig and otherwise sign things voted on by token holders. As far as I can tell there is no direct revenue or inflation reward given to this governing council.\n\nIf we take this 15% parameter on primary sales and sum up the YTD community treasury revenue we get $40.8M of primary sales leading to about $2M of treasury revenue and about [$10M total revenue](https://etherscan.io/address/0x860a80d33e85e97888f1f0c75c6e5bbd60b48da9) since inception. A current market cap of $27.5M for a PE close of about 13 before inflation or dev costs but there is no standard issuance plan for this treasury that I could find such as dividends or liquidity mining programs.\n\nThe token has 1B fully diluted supply and an inflation schedule documented [here](https://docs.superrare.com/whitepapers/master/the-rare-token/token-distribution). If we linearly project the YTD revenue out there will be about $50M in primary sales volume, leading to $2.5m in community treasury revenue, and 75M Rare inflation per year to the community treasury. If the treasury inflation was spent that totals to about $14.3M in inflation costs which far outweighs the protocols profit. The best estimate I could find for dev costs is [here](https://forum.superrare.com/t/i-have-a-very-specific-set-of-skills/859) which says the DAO owes the company $8.6M as of March which basically will bankrupt the treasury. Piling on top of that cost are inflation costs to the team and to investors totaling another 200M tokens per year. Given the lack of market share, revenue after costs, revenue sharing plan, and aggressive inflation schedule I don\u2019t view this as a compelling investment at present.\n\nThis appears to me to be decentralization theater. By the end of year 2, the team and investors will have a majority of token influence and will be able to enshrine themselves as the governing council, appoint themselves space curators, and direct the community treasury however they wish including paying themselves out through plausibly indirect mechanisms or just directly as they have done in the SIP linked above. Outside of the initial airdrop there is no ongoing mechanism to attract and enfranchise artists, traders, or community members.\n\nThis system is optimized for curators for artwork with high value primary sales. This makes the system closely parallel traditional art galleries and not targeted towards community NFT\u2019s like CryptoPunks or collectables like POAPs.

It will have a starting point of zero legitimacy, with a 6+ hour gap after the Merge where who knows what all was happening on the zombie chain (hint: DeFi will already be in full collapse, replay attacks will be rampant, and miners still on the zombie chain, including the PoW grifters who are about to fork it, will have been milking the network for all it's worth, dumping everything they can, etc. etc.)\n\nSo we have basically a grifter fork with almost zero warning, zero testing, zero audits, being built on top of a zombie PoW fork with zero legitimacy and infinite attacks and exclusive dumping.\n\nThe only things it will have going for it (probably, unless they messed that up too), is that the Chain ID will be changed to something different, and they'll have turned off the difficulty bomb.\n\n**So, dear reader - THIS is the PoW Eth that you are hoping to dump for profit.**\n\nBy interacting with this chain in the slightest, you are lending legitimacy to this absurd clusterfuck of a mockery of a cash grab.
