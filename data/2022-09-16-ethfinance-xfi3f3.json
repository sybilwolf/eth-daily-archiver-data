Currencies are not consumed when they exchange hands (unless you are burning some dollar bills to film a rap videoclip).

You have to lock-up some ETH, invest some capital in tooling and machinery (a PC, router, UPS...), use some other commodities (energy, internet bandwidth), follow a specific process which was discovered by a bunch of researchers, and, crucially, involve your own labor and know-how to tend for it and make it into ETH. This last part is crucial, because if you don't do your work properly you literally don't produce and may even lose your initial investment. Like a farmer may lose its harvest if it doesn't care properly for it, your production relies on your work. You need to maintain the PC available, secure and updated, you need to monitor its status, apply upgrades and fix it if something goes wrong, and sometimes do it at inconvenient hours of the day.

Stop (or invalidation) would be around 1485, the candle high pivot.</li>\n<li>I&#39;d consider nursing a long with tight stops at either 1425 (very risk averse), 1400 (risk averse), or as low as 1350 (playing with absolute high-beta fire).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/9JD1OyaM/\">Ratio is sadly in no (gentle)man&#39;s land.</a> Without a swift recovery above .073 this weekend, little reason not to go retest the 50 Week at .07.</p>\n\n<p>SPY was down but green. HYG was green. Semiconductors (the leader in this recent downturn) went green. Multi-assets were down but green. And LQD was green, but an inverted hammer. With this being a second retail gap down, SPY down but green, and 2/3 of our favorite bond canaries showing smart money <em>buying this dip,</em> my thought is the bleeding is at least staunched heading into Monday. Doesn&#39;t mean an easy road ahead, as the SPY 400 gap has now closed (in time, not trading) and based on 2022 so far, we&#39;ll be beneath 400 for another 3 weeks at least... right in time for midterm election turnaround October, or OcTURNber. Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, congrats on Merge week and congrats on surviving September Quad Witch 2022! $3.2 trillion changed hands today and you&#39;re still here, still standing strong. Unless you&#39;re redditing while pooping, in which case, sitting strong.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-16 14:24:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iopvohx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xfi3f3","parent_id":"t3_xfi3f3","score":57,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/howdeepisyourhouse","body":"Thanks KBrot, insightful as always","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks KBrot, insightful as always</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-16 15:37:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ioq5pnp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xfi3f3","parent_id":"t1_iopvohx","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/OMG_WTF_ATH","body":"Thanks for sharing","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for sharing</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-16 16:08:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ioq9s6g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xfi3f3","parent_id":"t1_iopvohx","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/0xDepositContract","body":"What do you mean by \"retail gap down\"?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What do you mean by &quot;retail gap down&quot;?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-17 02:31:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ios05y3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xfi3f3","parent_id":"t1_iopvohx","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KBrot","body":"You can see SPY closed Thursday at 388.5 but opened Friday way more down at 384, as though orders went in even though the market was closed. \n\nSpeaking generally, gaps are created by either enthusiasm or fear in the overnight futures or pre market.

Airdrops for Ethereum users are almost exclusively ERC20 tokens. Airdrops are used as either a form of initial distribution or marketing strategy.  \n\nA fork on the other hand is something completely different. You might remember the BTC/BCH chain split. That was  a fork. Or the ETH/ETC split. A fork as well.   \n\nWhat is a fork?   \n\nA fork happens, when some participants of a block chain change the rules of the chain, but others don't (or change it differently). If those changes are not compatible, the nodes do not recognize the other sides blocks as valid and the chain splits. We now have two chains.   \nIt's important to know, that those two chains share the same history up until the point of the split. So every coin, every token that was on the original chain is now on both, and only over time things start to change.   \nThis means that when you have 5 ETH and 10 Dai before the split, you continue to have 5 ETH and 10 Dai on both \"new\" chains. Whether or not they're worth anything is up to the market.  \n\n**ETHW and The Merge**   \n\nThe Merge led to a chain split as well. On the one side we have the PoS chain, on the other the PoW Chain. As we have learned, everyone who had ETH prior to the merge now has the same amount of ETH on the PoS Chain (called ETH) and the PoW Chain (called ETHW).   \nBut unlike airdrops, the other chains ETH does not magically appear in your wallet, since it's a completely different blockchain.  \nIn order to see and use the other chain, you have to make your wallet use the other chain.  \nIn Metamask (and other Ethereum wallets) this can be done by changing the RPC endpoint to the other chain.    \n\n**How could people instantly dump their ETHW?**   \n\nThey probably had their ETH on an exchange. In that case you don't own your ETH/ETHW, the exchange does. The exchange also knows it has the ETHW and can therefore directly enable trading for everyone on the platform, since none of those trading activities result in any on chain transactions.   \n\nEdit: some of the explanations are highly simplified.

Gamers are used to $60 pay once experiences that provide dozens (or even sometimes hundreds) of hours of entertainment. With open world single-player experiences being the new hotness, is something powered on chain even palatable for consumers?</p>\n\n<p>Only way I see it going well is if a game already enjoying free-to-play popularity introduces on-chain elements, along with some form of free introduction like reddit avatars were free initially. Players don&#39;t own their cosmetics currently and they clearly don&#39;t care (yet). Shit, we don&#39;t even own our steam libraries and we don&#39;t complain. </p>\n\n<p>Side note: you wanna make chain ownership interesting? What if people could resell their steam games as software products, and used game software stores existed?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-16 20:43:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ior70pe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xfi3f3","parent_id":"t1_ioqxvly","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/coinanon","body":"Maybe sell a limited edition game (NFT is the ownership), then owners can sell or rent out their license.

The article conflates these and confuses them a bit, but a careful reader can spot what he's talking about:\n\n> Chairman Gary Gensler said Thursday that cryptocurrencies **and intermediaries** that allow holders to \u201cstake\u201d their coins might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security.\n\nThe \"and intermediaries\" here is an important distinction. The crypto by itself is not, but a service that sells returns on that crypto may very well be. \n\nGensler specifically calls this out later on as well:\n\n> If an intermediary such as a crypto exchange offers staking services to its customers, Mr. Gensler said, it \u201clooks very similar\u2014with some changes of labeling\u2014to lending.\u201d\n\nFrom a technical perspective this is a pretty confusing quote on Gensler's part and he shouldn't have said it (because from a technical perspective, lending looks nothing like staking), but I believe all he was getting at is the exchange is providing a service with expectation of financial returns, and that has security-like features to it.\n\nI am not a lawyer, but for what it's worth a [well known crypto lawyer in the space agrees with me.](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1570572664003235840)\n\nLastly, I would just note we need to stop using security as a dirty word. Investment contracts aren't inherently bad, and at this point in the ecosystem we should encourage more securities to come on chain, as in many cases these token securities are more transparent than tradfi counterparts (don't need quarterly reporting, you can just check the chain). I'm not trying to say Gensler and the SEC have done a particularly good job at working with the space at all, but he's probably right that the vast majority of tokens are securities and fall under his jurisdiction as such. The big problem however, as Matt Levine notes it, is that the informal \"come talk to us\" structure Gensler and the SEC has set up for working with crypto has made it \"conspicuously the case that Gensler\u2019s SEC mainly goes after the more law-abiding crypto actors.\u201d ([Highly recommended reading](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-08/gary-gensler-wants-to-regulate-crypto?leadSource=uverify%20wall), Levine's articles are always on point). \n\nWe don't need to be scared of what securities are, we just need more formal structure to make it easier to understand what's allowed and what's not from the onset, rather than forcing developers to go talk to the SEC first, which is simply impractical for most small teams.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>On the ETH/Security discussion:</p>\n\n<p>First I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xenp6l/daily_general_discussion_september_15_2022/ioku7as/\">would reiterate</a> that the WSJ article is <em>probably</em> being misread.

But I don't share the alarmism that such a capture will happen at the scale implied by the time we're done rolling out the stuff we need to have a truly secure permissionless blockchain. \n\nThis [thread by Eric Wall](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1562004148442243073) is a reality check that it definitely would not play out anywhere near the worst case scenarios that we're preparing for. It's actually funny to me that we're always considering intricate hypothetical game theory scenario of a well funded attacker extremely knowledgeable about the intricacies of LMD-GHOST/Casper FFG fork choice rules to run custom client code to influence things in their favor etc. When in reality the actual challenges come from regulators who are clueless about what the internet is, let alone blockchains. Don't get me wrong it's still monumentarily important to hash out and discuss these hypothetical scenarios and mitigate them ahead of time, but I still strongly doubt they will have time to play out in a significant way.\n\nAnother thing that is very often implied by these discussions is that no one wants to build on a captured blockchain like this hypothetical post-merge worst-case scenario. If it does get captured, what will devs and users do? Most likely move to another blockchain that wasn't captured, right? And if none of the other blockchains available fit the criteria we want - permissionless, neutral, secured, censorship-resistant (which are in essence all the same thing) - then we build a new one. We keep working on the much-needed cryptographic tools, continuing the roadmap, just on the new blockchain.\n\nAnd if you believe that it only makes sense that the internet of value happens on a neutral permissionless blockchain, then that's the blockchain that will win, even if it takes a bit longer than we would want to, even if the new blockchain's price is lower than the previous blockchain who got captured. We were always expecting companies/governments to roll out their own blockchain, knowing it defeats the purpose if it's not neutral. Capturing Ethereum and then subsequently migrating to a new non-captured blockchain gets them there faster and easier, but in the end it's not much different than having a permissionless Ethereum and a regulated blockchain (other than network effects, although there's something interesting about network effects moving to rollups, and then rollups being able to more easily migrate everything to the new actually-neutral base layer). But I guess my point is no matter what we do, there was always going to be a permissionless and a permissioned world as long as nation states want to keep their control. And I much prefer the permissionless world, whether it's Ethereum or something else, that's where you'll find me.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>And yes, I&#39;m familiar with PBS and social slashing and everything else.</p>\n\n<p>But #ETH is pretty vulnerable for the near future should this administration decide to get frisky.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He&#39;s aware about all the cryptographic tools coming to preserve those important qualities, but it feels pretty handwavy.

It&#39;s actually funny to me that we&#39;re always considering intricate hypothetical game theory scenario of a well funded attacker extremely knowledgeable about the intricacies of LMD-GHOST/Casper FFG fork choice rules to run custom client code to influence things in their favor etc. When in reality the actual challenges come from regulators who are clueless about what the internet is, let alone blockchains. Don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s still monumentarily important to hash out and discuss these hypothetical scenarios and mitigate them ahead of time, but I still strongly doubt they will have time to play out in a significant way.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing that is very often implied by these discussions is that no one wants to build on a captured blockchain like this hypothetical post-merge worst-case scenario. If it does get captured, what will devs and users do? Most likely move to another blockchain that wasn&#39;t captured, right? And if none of the other blockchains available fit the criteria we want - permissionless, neutral, secured, censorship-resistant (which are in essence all the same thing) - then we build a new one. We keep working on the much-needed cryptographic tools, continuing the roadmap, just on the new blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>And if you believe that it only makes sense that the internet of value happens on a neutral permissionless blockchain, then that&#39;s the blockchain that will win, even if it takes a bit longer than we would want to, even if the new blockchain&#39;s price is lower than the previous blockchain who got captured. We were always expecting companies/governments to roll out their own blockchain, knowing it defeats the purpose if it&#39;s not neutral. Capturing Ethereum and then subsequently migrating to a new non-captured blockchain gets them there faster and easier, but in the end it&#39;s not much different than having a permissionless Ethereum and a regulated blockchain (other than network effects, although there&#39;s something interesting about network effects moving to rollups, and then rollups being able to more easily migrate everything to the new actually-neutral base layer). But I guess my point is no matter what we do, there was always going to be a permissionless and a permissioned world as long as nation states want to keep their control. And I much prefer the permissionless world, whether it&#39;s Ethereum or something else, that&#39;s where you&#39;ll find me.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-16 09:36:35","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-09-16 09:49:36","id":"iooo176","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xfi3f3","parent_id":"t1_iooi9a6","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Newman513","body":"I agree that the alarmism isn't necessitated, but attribute them leaning into that emotion because they're trying to get clicks / followers more than anything else.\n\nI appreciate and agree with all of your other points 100%.

What matters is that any dip below the monetary price (which can be measured because there is net negative issuance) is self-limited and tends to correct.</p>\n\n<p>*NOTE: I hope people don&#39;t mind that I keep sharing it but that&#39;s why I wrote it, so it could be referenced and useful to everyone. BTW that post and the models it contains predate the now infamous article by Hal Press and its Bankless appearence including his DCF attempt. Unfortunately his DCF is not a valid way to calculate it because he missed that you need to anchor the terminal value of the token to the monetary price otherwise you run into circular arguments. If you need a yield calculator or a way to estimate a price model just go to that spreadsheet, it&#39;s still to this day the most accurate and detailed and it&#39;s free and open for everyone to use.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-16 03:24:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ionbkx8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xfi3f3","parent_id":"t1_ion5iq0","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/techno-peasant","body":"A comment from Richard Heart's PulseChain subreddit: \"Lol idk if you've seen the news but the merge was a total shit show.\" has 8 upvotes","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A comment from Richard Heart&#39;s PulseChain subreddit: &quot;Lol idk if you&#39;ve seen the news but the merge was a total shit show.&quot; has 8 upvotes</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-16 03:04:37","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-09-16 08:23:14","id":"ion9z3w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xfi3f3","parent_id":"t3_xfi3f3","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-16 03:10:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ionaf53","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xfi3f3","parent_id":"t1_ion9z3w","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/techno-peasant","body":"That's how they cope since PulseChain is supposed to be a better version of Ethereum (funny I know) and it still isn't out.\n\nRichard said this last year: \"We're going to beat Ethereum to market with their own feature set.
