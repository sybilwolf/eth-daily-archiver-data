But I think it does, due to some second order effects that were not obvious. And it's a good thing! The network is operating more efficiently.\n\nFirst some data.\n\nNetwork activity hasn't gone down from the very recent pre-merge numbers, in fact the network is processing roughly 10% more transactions as was to be expected from the 10% faster blocks. So the drop in gas fees cannot be simply because network activity has died down. https://etherscan.io/chart/tx\n\nThe previous metric is a bit simplistic because it looks simply at number of transactions, but in terms of total gas used a similar effect is seen. https://etherscan.io/chart/gasused\n\nPending transactions also look more or less similar to pre-merge. https://etherscan.io/chart/pendingtx\n\nSo the most worrying thing, that network activity could be dying post-merge, is just not supported by the data. We are sustaining higher throughput than before so at least there is as much appetite for blockspace as there was just pre-merge.\n\nWhat I think is happening is that in PoW the network attempts to average certain time between blocks but there is no way to guarantee it. So sometimes they are discovered a bit sooner and sometimes later. This kind of process follows a Poisson distribution (see this image: https://www.fromthegenesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Poisson.png) When blocks are discovered late they are much more likely to be over the target average blockspace the network tries to maintain under EIP-1559. Under PoS blocks are created under a fixed cadence of 12 sec. and worst case sometimes there is missed block and we go to 24 sec (higher number of consecutive misses can occur but they are very rare under normal operating conditions). The change in the block creation distribution paired to the EIP-1559 gas update mechanic might be causing the drop in fees because there might be less occasions that result in a block being overly full.\n\nIf it's not clear let me try with an analogy. Imagine a metro line that operates in a slightly chaotic manner, each new train arrives randomly according to a Poisson distribution (see the image above) that attempts to target a train every 5 min on average. But the Poisson distribution is quite skewed so it's not that rare to have trains arriving 10, 12, 20 min late. For the sake of the example let's assume the passengers arrive to the station more or less evenly distributed. Let's also assume for the sake of the example that the number of passengers per unit of time is such that if the metro trains arrived perfectly on time the trains would be almost half full. When the metro train arrives a bit late it will go over half full, obviously. Now assume the metro line operator applies a dynamic pricing system such that if the train goes over half full it raises the price and if it goes under half full it lowers them. Whenever trains arrive late the users of the network get unfairly punished by the poor service of the metro line operator and get their prices raised, and, to add insult to injury, they are crammed in the train. While if the metro line operated perfectly on time there would be more than enough space as in the conditions described above the metros would get less than half filled, which would cause prices to go lower according to the pricing system.\n\nIf this is indeed what is happening, the merge improved greatly the UX of the network and it has resulted in a drop in gas fees beyond what could be expected due to increased throughput. And although we all love the smell of ETH being burnt in the morning this is a great thing. The network is providing a better service and we can accomodate more use cases that had been pushed out from the network due to exorbitant gas prices, exorbitant gas prices that were in part caused by the poorer service we could provide under PoW.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It&#39;s possible PoS is causing a drop in gas fees due to much more consistent block production and it&#39;s a good thing as we can increase throughput while lowering transaction fees which should result in induced demand over the long term.</p>\n\n<p>Gotta admit the drop in gas fees has caught me by surprise, we assumed the merge wouldn&#39;t have a significant effect on gas prices as it raised very little the throughput of the network. But I think it does, due to some second order effects that were not obvious. And it&#39;s a good thing! The network is operating more efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>First some data.</p>\n\n<p>Network activity hasn&#39;t gone down from the very recent pre-merge numbers, in fact the network is processing roughly 10% more transactions as was to be expected from the 10% faster blocks. So the drop in gas fees cannot be simply because network activity has died down. <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/chart/tx\">https://etherscan.io/chart/tx</a></p>\n\n<p>The previous metric is a bit simplistic because it looks simply at number of transactions, but in terms of total gas used a similar effect is seen. <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/chart/gasused\">https://etherscan.io/chart/gasused</a></p>\n\n<p>Pending transactions also look more or less similar to pre-merge. <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/chart/pendingtx\">https://etherscan.io/chart/pendingtx</a></p>\n\n<p>So the most worrying thing, that network activity could be dying post-merge, is just not supported by the data. We are sustaining higher throughput than before so at least there is as much appetite for blockspace as there was just pre-merge.</p>\n\n<p>What I think is happening is that in PoW the network attempts to average certain time between blocks but there is no way to guarantee it. So sometimes they are discovered a bit sooner and sometimes later. This kind of process follows a Poisson distribution (see this image: <a href=\"https://www.fromthegenesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Poisson.png\">https://www.fromthegenesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Poisson.png</a>) When blocks are discovered late they are much more likely to be over the target average blockspace the network tries to maintain under EIP-1559. Under PoS blocks are created under a fixed cadence of 12 sec. and worst case sometimes there is missed block and we go to 24 sec (higher number of consecutive misses can occur but they are very rare under normal operating conditions). The change in the block creation distribution paired to the EIP-1559 gas update mechanic might be causing the drop in fees because there might be less occasions that result in a block being overly full.</p>\n\n<p>If it&#39;s not clear let me try with an analogy. Imagine a metro line that operates in a slightly chaotic manner, each new train arrives randomly according to a Poisson distribution (see the image above) that attempts to target a train every 5 min on average. But the Poisson distribution is quite skewed so it&#39;s not that rare to have trains arriving 10, 12, 20 min late. For the sake of the example let&#39;s assume the passengers arrive to the station more or less evenly distributed. Let&#39;s also assume for the sake of the example that the number of passengers per unit of time is such that if the metro trains arrived perfectly on time the trains would be almost half full. When the metro train arrives a bit late it will go over half full, obviously. Now assume the metro line operator applies a dynamic pricing system such that if the train goes over half full it raises the price and if it goes under half full it lowers them. Whenever trains arrive late the users of the network get unfairly punished by the poor service of the metro line operator and get their prices raised, and, to add insult to injury, they are crammed in the train. While if the metro line operated perfectly on time there would be more than enough space as in the conditions described above the metros would get less than half filled, which would cause prices to go lower according to the pricing system.</p>\n\n<p>If this is indeed what is happening, the merge improved greatly the UX of the network and it has resulted in a drop in gas fees beyond what could be expected due to increased throughput. And although we all love the smell of ETH being burnt in the morning this is a great thing. The network is providing a better service and we can accomodate more use cases that had been pushed out from the network due to exorbitant gas prices, exorbitant gas prices that were in part caused by the poorer service we could provide under PoW.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-18 14:01:06","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-09-18 14:05:20","id":"ioz8rau","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xh7km4","parent_id":"t3_xh7km4","score":90,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/aaj094","body":"Very interesting point to chew on.
