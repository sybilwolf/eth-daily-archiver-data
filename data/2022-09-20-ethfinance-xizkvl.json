Since returns are APY <em>per validator</em>, LIDO obviously have an advantage by redeploying unused reward capital more efficiently than any home staker can. One thing that will definitely help is arbitrary validator stake sizes, but I believe that requires single slot finality and is some way off. Centralisation of staking through these kinds of small advantages of scale is an ominous threat - one we will be working hard to mitigate for several years. As I and others have outlined, if LIDO need to eventually be brought back into line through more aggressive means in the meantime then so be it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-20 15:23:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ip96k6z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xizkvl","parent_id":"t1_ip91tpq","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/morkogoz","body":"I expected this kind of response.

So if this is the market bottom... where is it?\n\nExhibit B: [The Dow Transports.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9fRzby7r/) Do you adhere to ol' Dow Theory, that it and not tech leads the market? Well, while the rest of the market continues to hang on to the higher lows at present, the Dow Jones Transport index did indeed set a clear as day lower low on the weekly. Not great.\n\nThis next part is my favorite because I'm gonna get so many tomatoes thrown at me from haters. Let's do this. Gather up on the carpet, kids, it's storytime. *Ahem.* Exhibit C...\n\nWay way back in the dregs of July, when the market roared out of what is currently the bottom to a higher high, I told you all something that remains true. In the entire history of the S&P, it has never gone from fully negative breadth to fully positive breadth and *not* locked in a bottom. The S&P did just that in late July, coincidentally right when we saw the July 19 50/50 buy signal on the daily. 100% of the time in stock market history, the bear market would end with this...\n\n... but there's just one problem.\n\nA little while back, Papa JPow annoyed the market makers and they sent the S&P clattering back down \\~8% to finish up August. And -- say it with me, kids -- in the entire history of the S&P, it has never closed YTD down more than 10% by end of August and *not* gone lower to fresh new lows and a deeper bear market. August 31, 2022, it was down about 16% YTD.\n\nIf you're following along, we have two indicators, two metrics, that both remain unbeaten for over 100 years. Godzilla vs Kong. Unstoppable force vs immovable object. We are living through history right now. The market will break something this time around.\n\nExhibit D: Last up is addressing the Fed, inflation, interest rates, and why this magical pivot everyone's pumped for is just not here yet.

[here's where bonds are putting us in April 2023.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yocVcg2r/) Yeah. \"KBrot, wtf?\" Yeah wtf indeed. We have a long, loooooong way to go friends. [How about December 2023?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/OjyRAQmm/) How sticky is inflation going to be according to the market makers? Yeah, fucking ruh roh is right.\n\nNow, you're surely thinking... didn't this guy say in July we'd see a new ATH before a new low? I did. How does any of this gel with what I theorized? Well, first it of course requires these bear scenarios to not play out. We don't want lower lows without bull divs alongside. After that, it's important to know that contrary to internet wisdom, you *can* fight the Fed. Hell, 2005-2007 was great for markets at the rates went up. The plunge, the doom, the drop, the *recession* does. not. happen. until the Fed *CUTS* rates. The pivot, which seems to be slated for around April, can be bearish or bullish. But the rate cut, which occurs on average about eight months after the final hike of the cycle? That's where the shit hits the fan.

It filled it day 1 -- removing the magnetism of 390 -- and then~~ SEE EDIT 3 -- not only failed to confirm day 2 but opened back below the gap *and* rejected off it in a higher volume red day. Not a bullish setup for what is usually a telltale day 3 surrounding a gap. We'll see if JPow and Co can undo that.\n\n[Grandpa](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4WtWYRMo/) is fighting with its last breath to avoid a close below 18950 ~~which would be a new lower low for 2022 on the daily~~ SEE EDIT 2. A close below doesn't mean game over, provided it forms a bullish divergence either on the same daily or the more important weekly.\n\n[ETH](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SFKumoLi/) is bear flagging at the bottom of the channel.

Instead, it's [forming a topping candle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/63b9kdxO/) and the potential start of an extremely bearish evening star. Again, the FOMC has the power to stop this so manage risk and hang on.\n\nSPY, DIA, QQQ, and IWM all printed indecision candles. Of those, SPY, DIA, and IWM all set local lower lows and closed in red haramis. QQQ at least held green without a lower low.\n\nAll our bond canaries IYLD, HYG, and LQD were red, confirming smart money agrees with downward movement today. And the latter two, the most important, did so on high red volume. Bad look.\n\nThe dollar DXY had a strong green day of course, stopping short of a true breakout. The 2Yr yield had a decent green day as well. And VIX has flipped full bull momentum on the daily again.\n\nThe look is bad, but so is every time bears get rugged by JPow and market makers.

If so, how are holding up with hedging the debt? I do quite poorly.</p>\n\n<p>I started staking 3 months ago and used dSNX debt mirror on Toros as my debt hedge. Couldn&#39;t help but constantly felt like my debt/hedge ratio is going in wrong direction. So I started to make notes:</p>\n\n<p>Date;        dSNX;            as sUSD;         Debt;        Diff;<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n01.09.2022;  3110.316181;     3116.390184;    3117.77;     -1.379816<br/>\n02.09.2022;  3110.316181;     3110.222762;    3118.88;     -8.657238<br/>\n03.09.2022;  3110.316181;     3109.691122;    3117.14;     -7.448878<br/>\n04.09.2022;  3110.316181;     3096.570418;    3113.41;     -16.83958<br/>\n05.09.2022;  3110.316181;     3093.803824;    3116.62;     -22.81617<br/>\n06.09.2022;  3110.316181;     3118.244913;    3146.19;     -27.94508<br/>\n...<br/>\n14.09.2022;  3110.316181;     3110.068773;    3146.04;     -35.97122<br/>\nafter burn V<br/>\n14.09.2022;  2800.316181;     2795.130767;    2832.30;     -37.16923<br/>\n19.09.2022;  2800.316181;     2738.992511;    2789.49;     -50.49748<br/>\n20.09.2022;  2800.316181;     2748.158696;    2798.47;     -50.31130<br/>\nafter mint V<br/>\n20.09.2022;  3039.683540;     2983.068113;    3033.53;     -50.461887  </p>\n\n<p>So during last three months, my dSNX drifted away from my debt value by more than 50 USD. Why? First half of that period crypto were on a rise, during the second half, crypto is dumping, and yet - my debt is constantly outgrowing my hedge. I earned 76 sUSD rewards during that period, so I am spending most the liquid gains to stay afloat on that position.</p>\n\n<p>Did anyone try a manual debt hedging (buy and hold real assets proportionally to global debt)?</p>\n\n<p>I see Kwenta finally added synth debt perpetual. Did anyone try to use it and can share their numbers? Also, does anyone already measured the price decay for 10x leveraged debt position?Is there any other debt hedging strategy that I didn&#39;t mention here?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-09-20 03:32:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ip6e501","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_xizkvl","parent_id":"t3_xizkvl","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Alen_x3","body":"Have you researched whether the platform you are using charges any fees?\n\nInteresting.
