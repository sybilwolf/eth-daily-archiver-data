(GHOST)\n* Whenever another staker proposes a new block, you should notify the execution client so that it can execute the block. This notification message should use a very particular data format that all execution clients are designed to understand.\n* When you see a new valid block for the first time, you should share it with all of the other nodes you are connected to, so that the entire network knows about it (gossip protocol)\n* If it's your turn to propose a block, ask the execution client to make a block for you.

Generational & demographic shifts.**\n\n* Different generational priorities\n* Shift of economic power (largest generational wealth transfer ever happening this decade)\n* Digitally native generation vs aging non-digitally native generation\n* Demographic changes, dropping birth rates, aging populations, etc.\n* Generations today and ahead set to be worse off than previous generations, lower standards of living going forward\n* \"Fourth turning\" stuff\n\n**4.

A tearing of our social contract, polarizations, tribalism, loss of social cohesion, rise of extremists, etc.\n* **Control:** persistent loss of freedoms, rise of totalitarianism and the surveillance state.\n* **Enlightenment:** a shift to and adoption of new ways of coordinating and organizing to better address the mounting challenges facing society, most likely enabled by smart contracts and blockchains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve noticed my emotions ebb and flow on 3, but it\u2019s one of the few things that gives me hope when look out over the long term.

Sorry for the long wall of text, but I needed to put everything I am unsure of into this long list of questions!\n\n1. What are the potential dangers of depositing to the rETH/WETH pool?As far as I understand, it is a MetaStable pool, because it contains tokens with known exchange rates. So, token-wise, the only real danger in this pool is if rETH de-pegs completely from its \"exchange rate\" with ETH. This could happen for (afaik) two reasons: a) a catastrophic failure/bug in the RP protocol, or b) a cascade of liquidations in rETH leveraged positions in DeFi (just like what happened with stETH some months ago). Correct?However, even in the two cases I mentioned above, assuming that all the ETH of the pool gets drained, one would have to hold to the rETH he is stuck with until RP recovers. rETH represents real ETH staked in the BeaconChain, so if/when RP recovers, the peg should be restored. Correct?2a) What are the dangers of using Balancer? As far as I know, Balancer has not been hacked as a protocol. Is this correct? I am not talking about pool shenanigans, but a real \"steal all the funds\" kind of attack.2b) What are the dangers of using Aura? (same as above)\n2. What is the correct/best way of entering the rETH/WETH pool in Balancer? I hold plain ETH. As far as I understand, I have three options here:a) Balancer allows me to enter the pool with that plain ETH. The protocol will then auto-swap my ETH to 50% rETH and 50% WETH.b) I first swap my ETH for the two tokens (50%/50%) and enter the pool accordingly.c) I see which token is slightly less balanced inside the pool (currently there is slightly less rETH in the pool), I swap my ETH to that token, and then I enter the pool.\n3. What are the dangers of staking Balancer LP tokens with Aura?This is the most confusing part for me personally. I have a very very vague idea of how protocols like Convex/Aura work, and to be completely honest I could not understand them even if I tried to. So, I have some basic questions about using Aura for what I personally only need it for:a) If I take my Balancer LP tokens and just stake them in the Aura rETH/WETH pool, will I be able to withdraw them anytime I need/want them, without any penalty?b) Will (just) this staking, allow me to capture the 16% (+ -) APR advertised currently for that pool on Aura?c) Is it necessary to \"time-lock\" my tokens further, which is something I do not want? (I do not care for any extra yield (+risk..) other than the 16% (+ -))\n4. Other than smart contract hacks, is there any other way my position in Balancer and/or Aura be compromised?
