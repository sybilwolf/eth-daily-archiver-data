This allows time for rewards to average out. Over shorter time frames, you will received regular rewards (currently ~4% and dropping) but the additional fee bonus will be entirely unpredictable. Staking via RP (or other method / service) gives you the option to join a \"smoothing\" pool whereby you'll receive those fees \"as you go\", thus increasing your regular income. You can flip this argument around: if you solo stake, you do expose yourself to the possibility of landing a block with very high fees. It's very unlikely, but you cannot play this game through RP (or other method / service).
