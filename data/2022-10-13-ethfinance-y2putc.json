It reeks of the early Bitcoiner mentality that any outside innovations will inevitably be adopted by Bitcoin (look how that turned out), or that optimizing for anything other than what Bitcoin optimized for was inherently a bad decision. I&#39;ve seen so many people argue that anything that has a &quot;lesser&quot; decentralization than Ethereum is basically a centralized timebomb that will inevitably fail, while completely ignoring metrics like Nakomoto coefficient or next to comments discussing how like three liquid staking services/CEXes essentially control half the total supply.</p>\n\n<p>Things are moving fast outside the Ethereum ecosystem, but no one here even seems to notice or care. Sure zkEVMs will allow heterogenous appchains within the next few years, but they are also already live and establishing product/market fit on Polkadot right now. </p>\n\n<p>Basically I am just frustrated that there isn&#39;t a better general crypto subreddit for me to lurk around instead lol</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-13 12:47:25","distinguished":null,"edited":"2022-10-13 12:58:14","id":"is732ak","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_y2putc","parent_id":"t1_is6p7ye","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/nitter_not_twitter","body":"[https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1535317675370487810](https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1535317675370487810)  \n\n[https://nitter.net/PAMauric/status/1535706313975648261](https://nitter.net/PAMauric/status/1535706313975648261)  \n\n ^(I'm a bot | )[^(Why & About)](https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&subject=Opt+Out&message=optout)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1535317675370487810\">https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1535317675370487810</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.net/PAMauric/status/1535706313975648261\">https://nitter.net/PAMauric/status/1535706313975648261</a>  </p>\n\n<p><sup>I&#39;m a bot | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/\"><sup>Why &amp; About</sup></a><sup> | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&amp;subject=Opt+Out&amp;message=optout\"><sup>Opt Out</sup></a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-13 11:18:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"is6p9lc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_y2putc","parent_id":"t1_is6p7ye","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/nitter_not_twitter","body":"[https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1535317675370487810](https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1535317675370487810)  \n\n[https://nitter.net/PAMauric/status/1535706313975648261](https://nitter.net/PAMauric/status/1535706313975648261)  \n\n ^(I'm a bot | )[^(Why & About)](https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&subject=Opt+Out&message=optout)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1535317675370487810\">https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1535317675370487810</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitter.net/PAMauric/status/1535706313975648261\">https://nitter.net/PAMauric/status/1535706313975648261</a>  </p>\n\n<p><sup>I&#39;m a bot | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nitter_not_twitter/comments/w0ssxp/more_information_about_this_bot/\"><sup>Why &amp; About</sup></a><sup> | </sup><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nitter_not_twitter&amp;subject=Opt+Out&amp;message=optout\"><sup>Opt Out</sup></a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-13 10:31:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"is6hwlo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_y2putc","parent_id":"t1_is6huy9","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Savage_X","body":"Gavin has a lot more name recognition in the Ethereum community, so I am sure he would have been a decent draw compared to whomever else they may send.\n\nPolkadot founders and the Ethereum community are not very friendly due to their history to begin with. \n\nI guess that happens when you are running one of the main Ethereum clients, raise a lot of money, lose it due to stupidity and then ask the community to bail you out and get rejected.
