This is a number [originally provided by the block builder](https://flashbots.notion.site/Relay-API-Spec-5fb0819366954962bc02e81cb33840f5#fa719683d4ae4a57bc3bf60e138b0dc6) and it is the relay's responsibility to simulate the block and confirm that the proposer will receive that amount. We can also confirm that 2) the builder was also aware of the desired fee recipient, [Stakefish's 0xffee0...43b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xffee087852cb4898e6c3532e776e68bc68b1143b).\n\nThe actual fee recipient, as [reported on etherscan](https://etherscan.io/block/15756366) was [0x5Caf7...58e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5caf7c1b096cf684b09ece3d3a142db0d46fc58e), an address that has received all of the MEV during the attack. This alone is not a bad thing: it's common for relays to set themselves as the fee recipients and add an extra transaction to pay the real recipient the fees+MEV. Buuuut no such transaction exists for these blocks. 0x5Caf7 has retained all the value for the full duration of the attack. It's clearly the address of the attacker, but I don't think there's any way to tell whether it belongs to Manifold or a malicious builder.\n\nManifold's response during all this is disappointing, but it does seem most likely that they were exploited and the funds are held by an attacking builder. I don't think Manifold should owe the proposers 8 ETH each, but it would certainly be an act of good will to reimburse proposers with the actual fees earned from those blocks, even if out of their own pockets.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to confirm some details here, as there are a lot of moving parts and it would be easy to cast blame on the wrong party if we&#39;re not careful.
