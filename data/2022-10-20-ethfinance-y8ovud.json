your fly-on-the-wall-of-the-core-devs-conference-room update on the situation regarding EIP-4844 (proto danksharding) and Shanghai release:\n\n* over the last several weeks, a few subteams have been formalized to work on each of the major threads to be delivered\n* at this point they all seem to be staffed and have been cranking at full speed.\n* made a lot of progress during Devcon last week.\n\nI might sum up their current position as something like \"*we know that withdrawals are a priority so Shanghai won't wait for us, but we think we have a shot at being ready in time to make the release so we're going at full speed.*\"\n\nThis begs the question, *when is the Shanghai target release date*?  How can the 4844 teams have some confidence they'll be ready for that deadline when they don't know what the deadline will be?  In a typical project you'd either fix the date then figure out what contents can be ready in time, or you'd fix the contents you gotta have then estimate the ready date for that basket of stuff.  Don't know if that will happen in this headless group, though.  We might anticipate some ACDs where they go round and round if they don't fix either parameter.\n\nTo be complete I must add that one member of one dev team said he thinks the client teams are looking at 8-9 months before they can be ready with withdrawals + 4844 + plus whatever else gets included. This was part of a suggestion to other teams to make sure they don't bundle their code changes for withdrawals and 4844 into a package that can only be released together -- i.e., make sure that if they need to release just withdrawals and hold back their 4844 code changes, they can do that.  But I don't know how serious that 8-9 months estimate is, and didn't see any other devs comment on that estimate one way or the other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, one risk factor for timely delivery of 4844 has emerged:  there is some concern that the blobs that will start being transmitted around the network may introduce disruptive latency.  They are going to set up some realistic test scenarios, see if it's really a problem, try to tune blob sizes if necessary.  Best case scenario, it's not a problem or if it is, it can be solved with some tuning.

As I am understanding it, this is the stuff that informs the macro, the pre-catalyst to any and every financial and monetary crisis.  \n\n\r  \nThe eurodollar, I get \u2013 it\u2019s the offshore dollar market. When banks lend to each other in the US it is all recorded and reconciled, when banks lend US dollars to offshore entities (non US banks, non US institutions, etc\u2026) US dollars enter an unregulated black box, the dollars get rehypothecated an unknowable amount of times, they get turned into crazy leveraged derivatives, used for complex swap schemes, and so on.  Because USD is the global reserve currency the demand for dollars is tremendous since most global trade happens in USD (countries sell their own currencies to buy USD to settle transactions and trade) and most of the massive ($350+ trillion) derivatives market is priced in USD there is simply not enough liquid USD to go around especially due to this black box effect. The more dollars get printed the more dollars end up in this black box, tied up in complex financial derivatives, in effect compounding dollar illiquidity.   \n\n\r  \nWhen stress appears in markets, demand for higher quality collateral increases as perceived risk increases. Since most of the highest quality collateral (USD) is tied up in the aforementioned black box, a liquidity crisis can form as counterparties rush to cover their liabilities and demand for pristine collateral sucks up whatever USD liquidity remains. Because of the nature of complex systems, this can quickly escalate to cause cascading effects \u2013 fire sales, death spirals, liquidations all vying for a limited supply of available dollars \u2013 the system folds on itself, slowly at first then all at once.   \n\n\r  \nCracks or warning signs of trouble appear in cash sensitive markets first \u2013 namely repo markets. Watch repo market fails, watch the use of overnight lending facilities, fed swap lines, watch any special thing that is presented as \u201cproviding liquidity\u201d by central banks. Increases here (of which there are many!) signal problems have already started and a global liquidity crisis has already begun. So what happens next? Or is my understanding of this major but often undiscussed part of the global economy not quite right?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Alright all you gigabrains \u2013 I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around the eurodollar and the global dollar shortage/liquidity crisis.  As I am understanding it, this is the stuff that informs the macro, the pre-catalyst to any and every financial and monetary crisis.  </p>\n\n<p>The eurodollar, I get \u2013 it\u2019s the offshore dollar market. When banks lend to each other in the US it is all recorded and reconciled, when banks lend US dollars to offshore entities (non US banks, non US institutions, etc\u2026) US dollars enter an unregulated black box, the dollars get rehypothecated an unknowable amount of times, they get turned into crazy leveraged derivatives, used for complex swap schemes, and so on.  Because USD is the global reserve currency the demand for dollars is tremendous since most global trade happens in USD (countries sell their own currencies to buy USD to settle transactions and trade) and most of the massive ($350+ trillion) derivatives market is priced in USD there is simply not enough liquid USD to go around especially due to this black box effect. The more dollars get printed the more dollars end up in this black box, tied up in complex financial derivatives, in effect compounding dollar illiquidity.   </p>\n\n<p>When stress appears in markets, demand for higher quality collateral increases as perceived risk increases. Since most of the highest quality collateral (USD) is tied up in the aforementioned black box, a liquidity crisis can form as counterparties rush to cover their liabilities and demand for pristine collateral sucks up whatever USD liquidity remains. Because of the nature of complex systems, this can quickly escalate to cause cascading effects \u2013 fire sales, death spirals, liquidations all vying for a limited supply of available dollars \u2013 the system folds on itself, slowly at first then all at once.   </p>\n\n<p>Cracks or warning signs of trouble appear in cash sensitive markets first \u2013 namely repo markets. Watch repo market fails, watch the use of overnight lending facilities, fed swap lines, watch any special thing that is presented as \u201cproviding liquidity\u201d by central banks. Increases here (of which there are many!) signal problems have already started and a global liquidity crisis has already begun. So what happens next?
