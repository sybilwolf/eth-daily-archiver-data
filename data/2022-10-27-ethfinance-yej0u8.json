I'm happy to say that progress is underway! I've been working with /u/KuDeTa on setting up a neutral relay, which we are calling *Aestus*, to be run and funded as a public good. Our vision is summarized in the following mission statement:\n\n---\n\nThere is currently a significant lack of diversity within the Ethereum MEV relay space. Despite their contributions to the community, current relays are managed by companies and projects with direct financial interests in MEV and related revenue streams. Opaque relationships between relays, searchers and builders make it difficult for stakers to decide which relays to use or trust.\n\nWe are in the early phases of building mev infrastructure which we offer to the community as a public good, free from any commercial interest and aligned to principles of credible neutrality:\n\n* **Censorship-resistant**: any relays or other architecture we manage will never censor or filter transactions;\n* **Non-judgemental**: will never exclude or promote specific types of MEV searcher strategy;\n* **Non-profit**: will never profit indirectly or directly from MEV;\n* **Unbiased**: will never make exclusive relationships with builders, searchers, or proposers, and will not run MEV software that could lead to a conflict of interest;\n* **Open source**: any software or modifications to existing projects will be published for all to see.\n\n---\n\nThe Aestus relay is currently deployed on the Goerli testnet, with most operation tested and functional. For testing purposes only, we are running a builder to provide some blocks for connected proposers. We would like to welcome additional Goerli validators and builders to connect to the relay, which will help us test relay connectivity, reliability, and scalability (and also help debug our test builder who's still not quite working).\n\nYou can find statistics and information at http://goerli.aestus.live/, and the URL to plug into your validators/builders there and below:\n\n    http://0xab78bf8c781c58078c3beb5710c57940874dd96aef2835e7742c866b4c7c0406754376c2c8285a36c630346aa5c5f833@goerli.aestus.live\n\nThe main hurdle in moving towards a mainnet relay is setting up the [significant infrastructure](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md#infrastructure) needed to provide redundancy and reliability at scale. This will take some development time, but having strong activity on the Goerli relay will help inform the larger-scale mainnet design.\n\n---\n\nFinally, we are looking to find additional help with this project. The biggest need at the moment is for someone who can contribute to and/or consult on cloud infrastructure deployment and DevOps as we look to scale up. But we would be happy to take on folks who are interested in regularly and seriously contributing regardless of area of expertise; there's a lot of work to be done. Relays at the moment do not generate revenue, so /u/KuDeTa and I are both volunteering our time and funds. We would greatly appreciate support and believe this is an important project to address a critical centralization bottleneck, but contributions would have to be given without an expectation of profit.\n\nQuestions and comments are welcome!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all, a while back I posted about seeing what it <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/y61zac/daily_general_discussion_october_17_2022/isoypyk/\">would take to run an MEV-Boost relay</a>.
