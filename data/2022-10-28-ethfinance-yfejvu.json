Although maybe you read it from someone else. \n\nWhat I meant... \n\nMining occured mostly through mining pools, the mining pool got the reward and then issued payments to the miners. These payments involved a lot of smallish transactions and further more the mining pool doesn't need to care too much about the base fee they paid because it didn't hurt their bottomline. They subtracted that cost from the payment issued to the miner so they sometimes were sending payments at times of high gas fees.\n\nOn the other hand, staking involves a lot more solo stakers so they don't need to get a reward from the pool. Centralized staking providers like Coinbase or Kraken also don't need to generate any on-chain activity to pay rewards. rETH is a rebalancing token, so no chain activity either to pay all those participants in the pool. So the dynamics have changed and a bunch of on-chain activity related to mining disappeared with it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I mentioned something like that but that&#39;s not exactly what I meant.

Its just an asset that you need in order to conduct transactions on the ethereum network. I treat my eth as a backup in case I need to leave the country in a hurry (persecution, catastrophic climate disaster, war, etc.) and keep some wealth/bribes via defi. As long as there are people out there who value eth in some way itll at least allow me to get back up and on my feet if my tradfi assets are frozen or unavailable. But first and foremost I have eth because I expect use cases on the network to grow exponentially over the next few decades and I want to ensure that I have access to the network. Theres going to be some crazy stuff that you can do on ethereum eventually and id rather pay the $1500 per eth now for those transactions than $3k or $10k or whatever your moon target is later.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-10-28 09:50:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iu54gow","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yfejvu","parent_id":"t1_iu52bxi","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sm3gh34d","body":"Not an inflation or recession hedge, but rather a hedge against social and political instability and future eth price appreciation.
