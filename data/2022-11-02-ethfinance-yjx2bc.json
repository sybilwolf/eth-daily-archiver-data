Until recently you had to go to an artist and ask them to draw what you wanted. Now you can tell it to Dalle-2, Midjourney and stable diffusion and the GPUs will draw the image for you within seconds at a fraction of the price of an artist. I think current Dall-e 2 prices are 3 cents per image.On my local machine it costs about 0.1 cents per image. No artist can compete with that. Will all artists, designers and photographer starve in the future? Probably not, but it will be similar to when photography was invented. Art changed in the years following the societal penetration of photography from being an exact copy of what we see around us to being more impressionistic and then expressionist. This was all because the artist could not compete with photography. I expect something like that in the coming years/decades. I do not know where it is heading, but there will be change.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-02 11:14:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iush1zg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yjx2bc","parent_id":"t1_iuse96a","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"Ok.

Or a restaurant? Or even DisneyLand? Conceptually, it's the same problem, only business details change. \n\nFirst, it would require lots of data storage, in a unstructured way (as all service providers worldwide, even only hotels, probably won't agree on a common data structure for all their possible equipments, advantages, remarks and all, on top of being reasonable to consider there will be more and more possible details and equipments in the future that we aren't thinking about right now), with lots of data updates, as well as an efficient way to query that data for the client software to get ordered subsets. \n\nIt will need payment processing, with ways to revert payment, in part or in full, if it is considered the service wasn't provided as expected. And then, it will obviously need a system to judge about the provided service and provide data to the revert payment system, to tell if it needs to be used or not. \n\nIt would also require service providers and clients to leave some funds at stake to show they're ready to pay for damages they've voluntarily or not caused to the other party: property destruction, harmful denial of services (leaving people out of sleeping place options at night, for instance, or leaving them stranded in some deserted place without any transport option) and such. \n\nIdeally, it would also require a way for people to prove they purchased the service and to leave a comment about it or even better ways to show how good the service is. \n\nIronically, I see the payment and judgement process to be the easy part: both of them already exist and would only need to be integrated together. Decentralized courts like AragonCourts exist. And decentralized escrow using an input to decide whether it should provide its money to one party, the other or distribute it among them is pretty easy to implement. And the staked funds could be part of that pooled money, to ensure each party can get paid torts for the negative consequences they have to suffer from whenever they've been harmed. \n\nProving how well the service went also is a quite easy part, since judgement results could be entirely public and tied to proof they're paid. If people want to cheat, they'll need to use gas and judgement services and fool the judgement service about the fact the booking has actually happened or that the service wasn't provided. Though, judgement calls of decentralized courts may need refinements over time to challenge cheaters and ensure they're requiring higher and higher costs while automating the process of proving facts for benevolent actors. Sure, it's not 100% foolproof, but the current system is already garbage in this matter anyway, so any improvement will leave us better off, here. \n\nThe main problem I see is that storage needs to be off-chain, for it's too much storage for on-chain, even more so with lots of data changing every day: any place may be booked or not at any day and this can change more than once as users and service providers can experience changes of plan. \n\nThis problem is of course even bigger when you realize people need to be able to search using criteria and browse results without needing to browse data about entirely different parts of the world or data about places that aren't available at all during so much time they become irrelevant (to avoid clutter from impacting searches). \n\nSo, we'd need something similar to Wildland for data storage, which still is ongoing development. But we'd also need to browse the off-chain stored data. I don't know if Wildland is planed to also be queried.
