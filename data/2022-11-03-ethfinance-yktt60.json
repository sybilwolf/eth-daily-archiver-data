Ask yourself the question, what is the moment you decide to buy something? Is it after you have seen a lot of talk about it in this or other subs? Because often the things that are talked about a lot are the assets that are up recently, they have already had a pump and might be due for a correction. In my experience the more quiet times are better for investing in something.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-03 06:00:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iuw0e8n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yktt60","parent_id":"t1_iuvy8nc","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Ive held RPL with the intent to stake, which I did in February.\n\nI am still up on my investment, but with the way things are going it looks like it is quite literally headed to 0.\n\nI really believed that it would act as a sort of 'leveraged ETH', of course any possibility of that occurring is long out the window...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ive held RPL with the intent to stake, which I did in February.</p>\n\n<p>I am still up on my investment, but with the way things are going it looks like it is quite literally headed to 0.</p>\n\n<p>I really believed that it would act as a sort of &#39;leveraged ETH&#39;, of course any possibility of that occurring is long out the window...</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-03 06:06:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iuw14md","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yktt60","parent_id":"t1_iuw0e8n","score":-3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/15kisFUD","body":"Honestly seems like an overreaction to me.
