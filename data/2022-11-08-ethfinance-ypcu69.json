But it\u2019s coming because clearly there is way more greed than \u201cin it for the tech.\u201d</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-08 12:38:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ivleova","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ypcu69","parent_id":"t1_ivlcu6t","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Gravy_Vampire","body":"This is awesome!

Or at least, I will relent that while it&#39;s certainly very possible we&#39;ve seen peak supply, I think after this chicanery calms down it could also scare many away and lead us to a new lull in activity. So  I would not personally call it &quot;likely&quot; that we&#39;ve seen peak supply just yet. Plausible, absolutely, just not likely imo. Over new years activity always lulls, and in bear market stagnation we could make our way to new supply highs by springtime or earlier.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-08 14:32:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ivlw7jo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ypcu69","parent_id":"t1_ivlusdi","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"OTOH, we're in a highly volatile world, reflected in the markets.
