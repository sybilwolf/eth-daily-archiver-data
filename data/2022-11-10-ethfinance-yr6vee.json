That&#39;s over. </p>\n\n<p>I have made this point many times before and I will say this again: We need self custody boomer wallets. Limited feature set, full focus on security and UX. Until we solve this, this market is fucked, cause people are scared now and they should be. If Binance goes down... (and I know there are probably some exchanges where you can store your coins, because they are insured, at least up to a certain amount that should be good for a lot of investors - that&#39;s probably the best way to go for now, which still sucks on so many levels)</p>\n\n<p>Some of you will probably not agree with me. Talk to your parents and explain them the 12 word seed phrase / recovery options, what they have to do to store the phrase, the wallet, etc. and ask them how much they would put in to such a thing. Of course self custody is the goal, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s not an option for 99% of the market today. </p>\n\n<p>Bearnido out.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-10 00:23:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ivskxti","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yr6vee","parent_id":"t3_yr6vee","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sfcpfc","body":"I think the way to go would be a super simplified Gnosis safe. It could even be a frontend to Safe.\n\nThe features I think would be essential:\n\n* The wallet never, ever shows seed phrases or private keys. You can't import phrases from other wallets.\n* The wallet enforces that you have it on at least two devices (everyone's got a phone and a laptop), preferably 3. These serve as backups.\n* Probably a centralized backend service can also be part of the multisig. Thenm, you allow having \"Sign in with Google\" as a backup option too.\n* The wallet makes an effort to check that all your devices are active and have access to them (i.e. if you lose your phone, you need to revoke it and add another device). This can maybe be through periodic checks, and maybe the app can be smart by listening to uninstalls.\n* The wallet is protected by biometrics, not passwords. Probably it doesn't work on devices without biometrics, which are increasingly more rare.\n* The wallet enforces that you have an ENS, like Argent.\n* The wallet either doesn't allow you to send to a raw address (only ENS) or performs very smart background checks on addresses: is the address empty? Does it receive a lot of deposits from multiple unrelated addresses? (Maybe it's a scammer)\n* The wallet doesn't allow you to do very much, it has no wallet connect. A boomer wallet probably doesn't let you shoot yourself in the foot by LPing on ApeDogPancakeSwap. If anything it directly integrates with safe and proven protocols, like Argent.\n* The wallet probably has an automatic timelock. If you're transferring 100% of your assets, you should be able to cancel the operation from another device.\n\nWhy I think this?\n\n* If the wallet asks you to secure a seed phrase, you can be certain that some users will not properly secure it and lose it or get it stolen. Or willingly give it away to phishing sites.\n* If the wallet asks you to remember a password, users will write it down.\n* If the wallet allows you to copy an address, it makes you vulnerable to clipboard hijacking. Probably we don't even want our boomer users to know what the hell is an address.\n* If the wallet allows pasting an address, users will make typos and burn their coins by sending to unrecoverable addresses.\n* Even with all of those, if the user actually has the ability to do whatever they want with funds at any time, they will always be vulnerable to gun-pointed-at-head attacks. They must have some limits like timelocks.\n\nThe problem with smart contract wallets is that L1 can get congested and L2 is not yet secure. Alternatively, it could be done with some sort of secret sharing scheme, but it wouldn't probably be as secure.\n\nI'm not saying that this is the wallet that everyone wants to use, but it's an example of how we could improve the security for the less tech savvy.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think the way to go would be a super simplified Gnosis safe.

It\u2019s surreal, almost biblical. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve seen people in this sub are affected at FTX.com. I\u2019m sick to my stomach because of that compared to the Terra or 3AC or CeDeFi blowups.  The degree to which FTX gained legitimacy and ingrained itself through trust from institutions and retail makes this a whole degree worse.  This is crypto\u2019s Lehman. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I think it\u2019s important to fess up to your receipts. Stay safe out there, and if you\u2019re struggling, I hope you can find some support or guidance here.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-09 22:48:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ivsdvkn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_yr6vee","parent_id":"t3_yr6vee","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/REALJohnBMacLemore","body":"Today.\n\nToday is the day you begin being the person you really want to be.
