This time it was a guy asking the following:\n\n***Why do you buy NFTs to enjoy the artwork when you can legally get them for free?***\n\n>**Tricky:** Typically either because you want to support the creator, gain some perks/benefits (access to benefits offered by the creator, think like a YouTuber offering premium or supporter exclusive content) or if it is a charity raising NFT. Cool side note, some charity NFTs such as \"Pooly\"s have been used to identify users who maybe be ethically inclined and are likely people you want in your community and so holders of such NFTs sometimes get \"airdropped\" coins or NFTs from other projects which may have voting rights or some monetary value to them.\n\n***Can't you do all of that without buying an NFT? I support all my favourite creators through Patreon and similar channels. Likewise, I give directly to charity and allow the Government to donate the tax I paid back to the charity.***\n\n>**Tricky:** Yes, much of it but not all. The primary difference is that with them being built on Ethereum, a public, permissionless and open source base layer, anyone can leverage the NFTs or build off it. For example, lets say a YouTuber follows a niche indie game really closely and they have an NFT minted to anyone who donates to them much like a Patreon, the indie game dev might decide that they want to give in game skins or early access to certain people in the community, well this is a great way to get this access out to the people who deserve it most and would be most interested. You can't easily do that with Patreon. Sure, it's possible but you'd need the indie game dev and the creator to coordinate and then probably get a list of emails of their Patrons. That might be against Patreon's privacy policy among other issues about how to get the early access keys or skins to. If they simply held NFTs then it's super simple. You simply get the NFT holders to connect their wallets to the game developer's website, they put in their in game name and boom, you just rewarded active/altruistic community members. Now expand this to charities, real world football games/tickets whatever the hell you can think of. It is next level rewards and community systems for any community with fans. Furthermore, voting rights can be delegated to NFT holders so the true fans can vote on what content to add next or where a band should tour/perform next in a sybil resistant way which existing systems like Twitter polls can't do.\n\n>So why does this need a blockchain? Well, it technically doesn't. But if you built this there are so many legal hurdles and adoption hurdles to get millions of different communities on board. I bet Patreon has thought of such things but not bothered. Furthermore, such a system would have in built fees and the possibility of censorship by whoever has the monopoly over such a platform. But with it being build on a neutral, decentralised, public ledger, nobody can tamper with it, nobody has a monopoly over the tech and anyone can build on top of this new standard.\n\n>We're a very long way away from this future but online communities have a long way to go and creators are dying for new ways to monetise their content because web 2.0 systems just aren't giving them enough from ad revenue alone.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m back with another explainer I made in another subreddit which nobody will see because the thread is dead. This time it was a guy asking the following:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Why do you buy NFTs to enjoy the artwork when you can legally get them for free?</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tricky:</strong> Typically either because you want to support the creator, gain some perks/benefits (access to benefits offered by the creator, think like a YouTuber offering premium or supporter exclusive content) or if it is a charity raising NFT. Cool side note, some charity NFTs such as &quot;Pooly&quot;s have been used to identify users who maybe be ethically inclined and are likely people you want in your community and so holders of such NFTs sometimes get &quot;airdropped&quot; coins or NFTs from other projects which may have voting rights or some monetary value to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>Can&#39;t you do all of that without buying an NFT? I support all my favourite creators through Patreon and similar channels. Likewise, I give directly to charity and allow the Government to donate the tax I paid back to the charity.</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tricky:</strong> Yes, much of it but not all. The primary difference is that with them being built on Ethereum, a public, permissionless and open source base layer, anyone can leverage the NFTs or build off it. For example, lets say a YouTuber follows a niche indie game really closely and they have an NFT minted to anyone who donates to them much like a Patreon, the indie game dev might decide that they want to give in game skins or early access to certain people in the community, well this is a great way to get this access out to the people who deserve it most and would be most interested. You can&#39;t easily do that with Patreon. Sure, it&#39;s possible but you&#39;d need the indie game dev and the creator to coordinate and then probably get a list of emails of their Patrons. That might be against Patreon&#39;s privacy policy among other issues about how to get the early access keys or skins to. If they simply held NFTs then it&#39;s super simple. You simply get the NFT holders to connect their wallets to the game developer&#39;s website, they put in their in game name and boom, you just rewarded active/altruistic community members. Now expand this to charities, real world football games/tickets whatever the hell you can think of. It is next level rewards and community systems for any community with fans. Furthermore, voting rights can be delegated to NFT holders so the true fans can vote on what content to add next or where a band should tour/perform next in a sybil resistant way which existing systems like Twitter polls can&#39;t do.</p>\n\n<p>So why does this need a blockchain? Well, it technically doesn&#39;t. But if you built this there are so many legal hurdles and adoption hurdles to get millions of different communities on board. I bet Patreon has thought of such things but not bothered. Furthermore, such a system would have in built fees and the possibility of censorship by whoever has the monopoly over such a platform. But with it being build on a neutral, decentralised, public ledger, nobody can tamper with it, nobody has a monopoly over the tech and anyone can build on top of this new standard.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re a very long way away from this future but online communities have a long way to go and creators are dying for new ways to monetise their content because web 2.0 systems just aren&#39;t giving them enough from ad revenue alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-12 10:02:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iw3iskn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ysy1o2","parent_id":"t3_ysy1o2","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"\n>***Why do you buy NFTs to enjoy the artwork when you can legally get them for free?***\n>\n>>**Tricky:** Typically either because you want to support the creator, gain some perks/benefits (access to benefits offered by the creator, think like a YouTuber offering premium or supporter exclusive content) or if it is a charity raising NFT.

Not really. It&#39;s true that some protocols got bad debt, some bridged assets may be unbacked, and many projects have lost their treasuries and/or funding.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I would say Solana has a 99% of being basically dead in the next 1-2 years, it won&#39;t go away but will keep slowly losing marketcap, users, devs, projects. A protocol that doesn&#39;t scale. Founders that keep making bad faith arguments on Twitter or straight up lying. They lost all their big funds, exchange and VCs. They lost any credibility they had left after associating with FTX/Alameda + Multicoin.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-12 04:56:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iw2fdgw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ysy1o2","parent_id":"t1_iw2ebdo","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"There will be another Solana next year.
