You&#39;ve even shown it&#39;s not even a way to prevent scams to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, you build tools so that people can easily and conveniently protect themselves from harm, just like when they learn not to burn themselves with an oven. Some will always do so, sure, but the goal is to ensure scams become unprofitable and that, to be profitable, they need to be closer and closer to an actual product, until they become an actual product. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s precisely how public bounties have ended up using black hats as benevolent market actors. You make the risk and profitability of hacking and scamming not as great as just providing the service, to the point you can&#39;t earn a living as a scammer or black hat anymore, but you earn more than a living by providing a service to the market. Then, you let the market do its work and ensure people don&#39;t scam anymore... or if so only as some expensive hobby.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-29 16:46:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iyatlj0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z7l5p0","parent_id":"t1_iy8wnog","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Jey_s_TeArS","body":">**Rewards in token,** \n\n>**Community was broken,** \n\n>**Market has spoken.**\n\n\n~Daily haiku until we\u2019re at least at 0.178 on the ETH/BTC ratio or highest market cap","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rewards in token,</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Community was broken,</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Market has spoken.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>~Daily haiku until we\u2019re at least at 0.178 on the ETH/BTC ratio or highest market cap</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-29 16:00:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iyan8vk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z7l5p0","parent_id":"t3_z7l5p0","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/the-A-word","body":"\ud83d\udd25","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>\ud83d\udd25</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-29 16:16:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iyapjfy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z7l5p0","parent_id":"t1_iyan8vk","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Jey_s_TeArS","body":"thank you ser.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>thank you ser.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-29 18:43:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iyb8y2o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z7l5p0","parent_id":"t1_iyapjfy","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Run your own Lattice1 Messaging Router in 1-click, using Dappnode!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ajz0ZHPCNFY\n\nLattice Connect can be deployed in a variety of ways.

It\u2019s probably easier since you don\u2019t need to track every individual NO commission and divide by total number.  I think the issue (when I\u2019ve brought it up before) is that NOs are (?understandably?) worried that they will invest 10% on RPL, and then the commission will drop to 5% or something; then with gas fees etc, it becomes a losing proposition compared to solo staking.  But to me, if rETH demand is low enough to necessitate a 5% commission, RPL/ETH is probably tanking as well.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-30 08:47:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iydlkfs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z7l5p0","parent_id":"t1_iyaayyw","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Perleflamme","body":"I think he's talking about a dynamic, collective fee rate that depends on how many rETH have been created and is having ETH waiting in the pool without anyone taking them to create new mini-pools, for instance.\n\nI think this is something that would be cool as soon as the pool becomes fully decentralized (I think it's the only thing that isn't yet completely decentralized, hence why the pool is limited to 5k ETH, if I remember correctly).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think he&#39;s talking about a dynamic, collective fee rate that depends on how many rETH have been created and is having ETH waiting in the pool without anyone taking them to create new mini-pools, for instance.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is something that would be cool as soon as the pool becomes fully decentralized (I think it&#39;s the only thing that isn&#39;t yet completely decentralized, hence why the pool is limited to 5k ETH, if I remember correctly).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-29 14:33:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iyab2nz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z7l5p0","parent_id":"t1_iy7xu2v","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[removed]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[removed]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-11-29 04:26:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"iy7x0ip","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_z7l5p0","parent_id":"t1_iy7u381","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/alexiskef","body":"This is not new.
