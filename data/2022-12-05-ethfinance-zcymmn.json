This is how it works:\n\nFirst the owner of the wallet makes some transaction that gets the scammers attention. In this case it was a 5000 BUSD deposit to Binance. This was a legitimate transaction made by the wallet owner (tx hash: [redacted]). The scammers also like that the wallet address still has plenty of funds that the wallet owner might want to deposit to Binance in the future.\n\nAs you can see the Binance deposit address of this particular user is the following:\n\n[redacted]\n\nMeaning that whenever the wallet owner wants to deposit funds to Binance this is the address they send funds to. And this is where the phishing begins, the scammer\u2019s goal is to get the wallet owner to accidentally deposit funds to a different (but similar) address. In this case the scammers generated the following address:\n\n[redacted]\n\nAs you can see the start and end of the address is very similar to the actual deposit address. They both begin with \u201c[redacted]\u201d and end with \u201c[redacted]\u201d. So if you do what many people often do and just look at the first and last characters they will look the same at a glance.\n\nSo now the scammer just needs you to accidentally copy their address instead of the official Binance deposit address, and to do that they make sure to establish history between the wallet owner\u2019s address and the scam address. They do this both by sending 0 BUSD transfers from the scam address to the wallet address, but also by sending 0 BUSD transfers from the wallet address to the scam address.\n\nYou might think they can not send anything from the wallet address to their scam address because they do not control the private keys of the wallet, but this is not entirely accurate. The TransferFrom method of ERC20/BEP20 tokens allows any address to send funds from any other address as long as the amount doesn\u2019t exceed the allowance given, but in this case since the amount is 0 it doesn\u2019t exceed the allowance which by default is 0.\n\nYou also probably are a little extra confused by using the DeBank history since it lists everything in one place, but if you go to BSC scan you can see under \u201ctransactions\u201d that these illegitimate transactions don\u2019t show up at all (only the real transfer of 5000 BUSD), they will only show up if you specifically go to \u201cBEP-20 Token Txns\u201d and here \u201cFrom\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that the transaction was sent from that address, but that the tokens were transferred from that address, which is very different.\n\nSo now the scammers just hope that when this wallet owner wants to deposit to Binance next time they will be too lazy to login to Binance in their browser to copy the address from there, and will instead copy it from their recent transaction history (where they will copy the wrong address because it looks familiar). And even if they check the Binance App on their phone to see that the 5 first and 5 last characters match the address they have copied everything will seem okay and they will confirm the transfer to the scammer\u2019s address.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Something similar on the trezor subreddit?  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/trezor/comments/z8msk1/_/iyd01ha\">https://www.reddit.com/r/trezor/comments/z8msk1/_/iyd01ha</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: Adding the post language for posterity:</p>\n\n<p>Ah, this is actually a pretty cool phishing scam method that I haven\u2019t seen before.

If take-up is too fast, it could throw the existing financial and banking systems out of balance, the report says. The prevailing fear is that the use of any CBDC would require a shift of funds out of bank deposits and into digital cash. Without bank deposits, banks won\u2019t have the funds to issue loans that help them make money.

They, in turn, work with central banks on policies that can directly benefit the populace.</p>\n\n<p>CBDCs could fundamentally change that, bringing central banks closer to the people in a way that nothing else has done.
