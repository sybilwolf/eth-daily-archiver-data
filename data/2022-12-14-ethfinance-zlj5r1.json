Assuming constant network activity, increasing ETH price increases gas costs in USD (even if gwei cost stays the same). Further, we saw gas prices get incredibly high while ETH was skyrocketing so it makes sense that this pattern would repeat. I don't see anything controversial with this.\n\nI recall Arthur being super bullish on ETH this year and on a medium-term horizon so I don't think he's trying to fud ETH into the ground. I wouldn't attribute this to malice (he isn't giving off BTC-maxi vibes with these arguments) so I'm leaning more towards these being bad takes.
