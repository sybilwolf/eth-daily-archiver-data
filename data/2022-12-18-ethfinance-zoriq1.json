I\u2019ve also been thinking about possible blockchain technology use cases in this future.\n\nI see generative AI as a content generating machine. Its ability to synthesize a large amount of information and present it in a new way is truly remarkable. As this technology gets better and better, I can see things happening like: \u201cHere is all of written history about the French revolution, now produce me a 5 hour podcast episode in the style of Hardcore history and narrated by Morgan Freeman\u201d. Sure ChatGPT still has its faults and inaccuracies and it\u2019s still possible to discern it from actual humans most of the times, but this technology will get iterated upon and improve.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this future is 5 years away or 25, but I believe at some point there will be an abundance of content on the internet with AI generated video\u2019s, blogposts, art, all possible kinds of content and \u2018users\u2019 (bots). In this future I identify two problems where blockchain technology might offer solutions; identity and IP ownership.\n\n**Identity**\n\nThe identity problem is twofold. Most obviously we need a way to discern humans from bots. Human attention is valuable on the internet and bot attention is not. Furthermore it might be nice to know if there is an actual person on the other side that you are debating with. As AI gets better and better, it will be possible to create fake users that span multiple platforms generating thousands of comments over multiple years. It might not be so easy to spot a bot by its comment history anymore. I think a combination of Blockchain and ZK-proofs is the best way to come up with some proof of humanity solution. Blockchain because it\u2019s a source of shared truth that tracks activity over time and Zero-knowledge proofs because we don\u2019t want to share everything about ourselves, only that we are in fact human. I\u2019m not sure what it should look like, maybe it involves multiple IRL verifications or checkpoints, but I\u2019m sure a solution will come up when it is so badly needed.\n\nThe second problem is a bit more abstract human one. I think the abundance of content will lead to some sort of identity crisis to a lot of people. We humans like to express our individuality. If our art, texts, and maybe even music (though I hope that one is still up in the air) might become a drop in the ocean of content that\u2019s out there, what still makes us special and human? I think we might express ourselves by creating artificial scarcity, by linking our identity to real events and real humans and by building a digital identity. I see a role here for NFT\u2019s and for POAPs. Small disclaimer, I do think there will still be a place for human creativity and a way to be uniquely human in the arts.\n\n**Intellectual property**\n\nAnother big problem with AI is that it uses existing content to create new content. The neural network is only as good as the data that feeds it. There is a problem with this: if all of the value comes from the inputs, how do we make sure that the creators of these inputs are rewarded properly? This becomes even more of a problem in the future: in a world where content can be created using AI, what incentive is there to create new content manually? However if nobody produces new content, we will never really progress because the neural network does not get better by feeding itself with its own output.\n\nProviding good quality input data will be a valuable service, a common good if you will. So there will be a need to properly incentivize new real content creators. People that write code, do research, make art, make video\u2019s that help the AI create countless of derivatives. I honestly have no idea how to do this technically, but I envision some sort of way of tracking how much a certain piece of input data has been used for output and rewarding the user proportionally. If this is not possible, some sort of retroactive funding should take place. What better technology to track ownership of data and provide payments than blockchain technology?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Like many of you I have been playing around a lot with ChatGPT and I\u2019ve been thinking about how artificial intelligence will shape the future.

Keep dreaming about riches kept offshore. Keep hoping and waiting for more. Keep shaking your fist at whoever and whatever you abhor. Keep screaming <em>the world is a whore!</em> till your voice is gone and your throat\u2019s all sore. <em>Can you get me a peppermint pweese bb?</em> \ud83d\ude18</p>\n\n<p>But you better keep that wildness suppressed! Lower your fists, you don\u2019t wanna buy a ride in the ambulance. <em>Hah! Like\u2026 who can afford that, am I right my Amerifats!?</em> Keep it up and you \u2018gon learn just how short life is. Three hits. One my fist. Two, you and the floor kiss. Three, my hand in a bucket of ice. You? Severely damaged Neurites.</p>\n\n<p><em>Hi kids! Do you like violence? Did that make your nipples as hard as ice picks? Wanna copy me and go to jail exactly like I did?</em></p>\n\n<p>Hey.. look.. no one wants that now do we fren? Of course not, anger and stress\u2026 it just don\u2019t make sense\u2026 at least for rational humans. I mean think about this\u2026 that ain\u2019t a win/win/win, so like why you getting your undies all in a twist? I mean\u2026isn\u2019t that why you bought in? Isn\u2019t that why you got some <em>Ethereyummms?</em> \ud83e\udd24 </p>\n\n<p>Did you really buy in early just to sell at the beginning of the momentiums? Did you really get in early only to dump it now because it feels all scawwy? Fuck no! Look down\u2026 your genitalia are naturally hairy! Your a goddamn grown up humun and you own <strong><em>Ethereum!</em></strong> Yeah you know the one\u2026 the world\u2019s first and only blockchain utilitarian! Did you forget\u2026 you invested in the decentralization of human coordination? You invested in freedom. You invested for a win/win/win.</p>\n\n<h3>ETHEREUM</h3>\n\n<p><em>I am but a drop in this mighty river roaring into the ocean, but I am a drop.</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-18 01:21:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j0ozhni","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zoriq1","parent_id":"t3_zoriq1","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Perleflamme","body":"I'm very surprised this gets downvoted.
