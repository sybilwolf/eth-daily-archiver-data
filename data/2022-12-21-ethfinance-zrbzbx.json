It is older, has way more TVL, wonderful docs and in general: has more \"professional\" vibes. Also, its model is easier to understand (you borrow real assets from real people instead of synthetic stablecoin). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>also what collateral rate people are going for? I'm assuming 200%+ right?\n\nThe answer is from: zero to infinity. You can check all the position on-chain and do some data digging to find \"average\", \"median\" etc LTV. Liquity has even front-end list of \"risky troves\" where you can browse easily through others' positions:\n\n[https://liquity.app/#/risky-troves](https://liquity.app/#/risky-troves)\n\nI personally aim to hold \\~200% debt to loan, but I am not doing anything big or fancy, so I am probably not a valid case study. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>can anyone ELI5/8 how that works? I tried looking through their docs but it's pretty technical.\n\nAlchemix is very liked in this sub, so that's a plus. I, personally, don't like it. The only valid use case for me is tax efficiency, but that depends on where you are living. \n\nOfficial (marketing) eli5 would be: you take loan that can not be liquidated and pays itself off. \n\nNormal eli5 is: you invest your asset in very low yield bond and get your future coupons (earnings) up-front. You decide how much of these \"future earnings\" you want, but it is capped at 50% of your position. \n\nThen you have two options. Either wait for this value to be earned on top on your bond (few dozen years), or return what you've \"borrowed\" and then recover you whole position. \n\nThis is the same as selling half of your stack and investing the other half in any DeFi platform waiting for it to double in size (but alchemix has way lower APR). It \\*would\\* make sens, if you could use Alchemix to borrow one asset against the other, but no.
