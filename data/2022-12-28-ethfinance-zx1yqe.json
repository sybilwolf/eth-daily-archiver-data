Here are three forms of that I think we'll see an uptick of this year.\n\n1) Restaking. Specifically EigenLayer. We should see something from them this year that can compete with Filecoin at a functionality level while reducing protocol costs by over 95%. This paradigm can be extended to oracles to replace LINK and GRT, shared compute tokens like GLM and FILE, and potentially even replace the backstop token of insurance protocols like NXM. All while eliminating the time cost of money from each of those use cases and generally bolstering their security. As a side effect the more successful this is the higher the ceiling on staked ETH.\n\n2) Interest Bearing Liquidity. We're already seeing the rise of rETH, cbETH, and wstETH as liquidity in AMMs like Curve and Balancer. As an AMM LP there are two ways of increasing your yield. The first way, liquidity compression, also amplifies your IL. The second way is to simply deploy liquidity to token pairs where the tokens being traded between are yield bearing. In addition to FPI (which is brilliant) we need to see a US bond interest bearing stablecoin. We can then have something like a cbETH/cbTreasuryBond pair that earns liquidity on both sides.\n\n3) Policy-based Yield Protocols. This inverts the paradigm of interest bearing liquidity and instead does book keeping in the base assets while using composable protocols under the hood for yield. I think we'll see the industry approach this from two sides.\n\nFirst, an AMM like Balancer or Curve will take the 'idle' liquidity on the depth chart and deploy it to something like Aave under the hood. This would be a one policy fits all approach.\n\nSecond, a protocol like Yearn or Tokemak will evolve to enable customer defined policies to accompany their account. I think this is the end game for Defi. Eventually, you will be able to specify a policy for how a protocol manages your money so you can specify your own risk adjusted optimum yield strategy. A policy will contain a priority order for where to place your money amongst composable protocols. For example, you might specify that you want your money in a liquidity range on Uniswap v3 like $1k-2k but liquidity beyond 2% slippage is placed in Aave or Compound while it is idle. Fund pooling will make it economical to rebalance liquidity according to the policy every few minutes.\n\nI can also see some of this type of management belonging inside the Dex itself. For example you can add things like volatility tolerance as a parameter in addition to liquidity ranges (or asymmetric liquidity ranges in the case of Carbon). When the price starts to move the Dex can remove liquidity from the depth chart automatically in a way that an external protocol could not.\n\nAnywhere you see USDC or ETH parked natively e.g. Maker, Augur, Uniswap, or GMX is ripe for this style of disruption. Anywhere you see a token that serves as collateral, e.g. REN, LINK, NXM, GLM is ripe for this type of disruption. The end result of these three innovations in capital efficiency is less equity sitting idle in Defi making 0% and a progression towards a fully yield bearing ecosystem with ETH staking yield as the zero-risk rate for all manner of decentralized services provided.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>We, as an industry, are continuously seeking out more capital efficient solutions.

This inverts the paradigm of interest bearing liquidity and instead does book keeping in the base assets while using composable protocols under the hood for yield. I think we&#39;ll see the industry approach this from two sides.</p>\n\n<p>First, an AMM like Balancer or Curve will take the &#39;idle&#39; liquidity on the depth chart and deploy it to something like Aave under the hood. This would be a one policy fits all approach.</p>\n\n<p>Second, a protocol like Yearn or Tokemak will evolve to enable customer defined policies to accompany their account. I think this is the end game for Defi. Eventually, you will be able to specify a policy for how a protocol manages your money so you can specify your own risk adjusted optimum yield strategy. A policy will contain a priority order for where to place your money amongst composable protocols. For example, you might specify that you want your money in a liquidity range on Uniswap v3 like $1k-2k but liquidity beyond 2% slippage is placed in Aave or Compound while it is idle. Fund pooling will make it economical to rebalance liquidity according to the policy every few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>I can also see some of this type of management belonging inside the Dex itself. For example you can add things like volatility tolerance as a parameter in addition to liquidity ranges (or asymmetric liquidity ranges in the case of Carbon). When the price starts to move the Dex can remove liquidity from the depth chart automatically in a way that an external protocol could not.</p>\n\n<p>Anywhere you see USDC or ETH parked natively e.g. Maker, Augur, Uniswap, or GMX is ripe for this style of disruption. Anywhere you see a token that serves as collateral, e.g. REN, LINK, NXM, GLM is ripe for this type of disruption. The end result of these three innovations in capital efficiency is less equity sitting idle in Defi making 0% and a progression towards a fully yield bearing ecosystem with ETH staking yield as the zero-risk rate for all manner of decentralized services provided.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-28 12:26:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j20odqd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zx1yqe","parent_id":"t3_zx1yqe","score":40,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nested_dreams","body":"Lot of interesting ideas here.

Here is where I agree\n\n>\"Sellers have run out of coins\" has been chanted at every level right before we break down to the next.\n\nYes I never buy into this either. New events can and will create new sellers. Maybe there are still a lot hopeful for now because we crab for so long but as soon as it starts bleeding down slowly they capitulate. Maybe the chart will start to look a certain way that will get TA people to short and other people to panic. Maybe something else bad happens that will demoralize people. All of this is possible.\n\n>treasuries have been wiped out on FTX that are yet to be made public\n\nThis can certainly happen and I agree it won't feel good.\n\nHere is where you might be right and I really don't know:\n\n\"we are still at 1200 atm because a lot of people are rotating out of shitcoins / micros => eth & btc.\"\n\nPossible, though will they sell this for $ later? If so why wait? And shitcoins still have a way to go, maybe more people will rotate into ETH & BTC still?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is where we differ:\n\n1 )\n\nI don't think you are alone in expecting bad things to happen. I think a large share of market participants shares your thesis and that's exactly why we are down from 4800 to 1200 even though we have merged succesfully. I think the market already does a good job of pricing in future contagion. After 3AC blew up we went down to below 900 and we haven't hit that since. I think this is because the current price is also a reflection of future expectations. A lot of people thought that was only the beginning of contagion so we must sell. Because it\n\n>seems bleedingly obvious to me that there's a lot more reasons out there that'll send us down than there are that will send us up\n\nAnd they would have been right about the events. I mean FTX blowing up? That's huge! But wait why is the price still higher?\n\nEven after FTX implosion we haven't hit that low. Why would the implosion of some minor treasuries be different?\n\n2 )\n\n>The lack of demand reflective of low gwei means a lack of buyers (& users).\n\nIf this were structural into the future, this is definitely a problem because it would mean that ETH is not a good product.

New events can and will create new sellers. Maybe there are still a lot hopeful for now because we crab for so long but as soon as it starts bleeding down slowly they capitulate.

I think a large share of market participants shares your thesis and that&#39;s exactly why we are down from 4800 to 1200 even though we have merged succesfully. I think the market already does a good job of pricing in future contagion. After 3AC blew up we went down to below 900 and we haven&#39;t hit that since. I think this is because the current price is also a reflection of future expectations. A lot of people thought that was only the beginning of contagion so we must sell. Because it</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>seems bleedingly obvious to me that there&#39;s a lot more reasons out there that&#39;ll send us down than there are that will send us up</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And they would have been right about the events.
