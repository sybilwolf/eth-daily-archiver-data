In short, it will be allocated to 50% rETH, 30% an &quot;Investment Portfolio&quot;, and 5% a &quot;community portfolio&quot; (a euphemism for &quot;high-conviction degen NFT trades guided by our in-house experts&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>The transactions are currently created and being signed by the multisig members in the DAO multisig Gnosis Safe, which you can view here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://app.safe.global/eth:0x29816F59f1c7E1ba69289cf486556929F7743cA2/transactions/queue\">https://app.safe.global/eth:0x29816F59f1c7E1ba69289cf486556929F7743cA2/transactions/queue</a></p>\n\n<p>Thank you to the Stewards for putting together this proposal and, well, stewarding our finances, and to all EVMs holders who voted on the several Financial Stewards related proposals over the past months!

Some reasons they might be less secure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They rely on bridged assets, and the bridges can have significant trust assumptions or security weaknesses (see Ronin, wormhole exploits)</li>\n<li>Sidechains generally have fewer validators or those validators are more centralized and controllable relative to the main chain </li>\n<li>Sidechains usually use more novel architectures than the main chain and could have undiscovered weaknesses/issues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If something is intentionally trying to be a &quot;sidechain&quot; to a larger chain like ETH or BTC, you specifically need to assess the security of the bridge as well as the sidechain&#39;s consensus mechanism (and/or sybil resistance mechanism) to see how safe it is. A chain could have a perfect bridge but if it&#39;s only run by one guy, he could push a node update that simply transfers everyone&#39;s balance on the chain to him, or if he&#39;s the only validator he could simply hold your funds hostage indefinitely by refusing to include your withdrawal transactions. Likewise, a chain could be perfectly decentralized but if the bridge is hacked, everyone&#39;s bridged assets go to zero on the sidechain.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-29 11:41:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j25bag2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t1_j255frm","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"Thanks for the help!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for the help!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-29 18:09:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j26w25c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t1_j25bag2","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I'm not so much a technical person, but I think most sidechains are still centralized in some way?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m not so much a technical person, but I think most sidechains are still centralized in some way?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-29 11:09:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j256eqv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t1_j255frm","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Mister_Eth","body":"Ethereum","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-28 22:00:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j22sr91","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t3_zxxihz","score":34,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Vinegar_Strokes__","body":"$1197","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$1197</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-28 22:00:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j22ss6b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t1_j22sr91","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/usesbinkvideo","body":"85,971 hodlers subscribed","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>85,971 hodlers subscribed</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-28 22:14:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j22u2um","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t1_j22ss6b","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/REALJohnBMacLemore","body":"31 pending validators","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>31 pending validators</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-28 22:22:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j22ut5c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t1_j22u2um","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/nixorokish","body":"0.072","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>0.072</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-28 22:24:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j22uz19","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t1_j22ss6b","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/syzygy00778","body":"7025 validators to go before half a million active validators.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>7025 validators to go before half a million active validators.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-28 23:27:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j2305nf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t1_j22uz19","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/not-ngmi","body":"What\u2019s the best steelman argument for a long term bear?\n\nI think it\u2019s that an exponential increase in blockspace might outpace application development creating a massive shift in supply/demand. \n\nI think the best counter argument is that increased block space unlocks higher frequency defi activities and MEV opportunities that don\u2019t exist today. \n\nThe counter argument does feel a little hand wavy tho","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What\u2019s the best steelman argument for a long term bear?</p>\n\n<p>I think it\u2019s that an exponential increase in blockspace might outpace application development creating a massive shift in supply/demand. </p>\n\n<p>I think the best counter argument is that increased block space unlocks higher frequency defi activities and MEV opportunities that don\u2019t exist today. </p>\n\n<p>The counter argument does feel a little hand wavy tho</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2022-12-29 13:08:27","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j25opvj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zxxihz","parent_id":"t3_zxxihz","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Papazio","body":"Quantitative tightening, sticky inflation, strong dollar, energy & cost of living crisis, persistent high interest rates, developed world recession/depression, escalating/new war, over zealous crypto regulation, more over leverage or fraud contagion.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Quantitative tightening, sticky inflation, strong dollar, energy &amp;
