[Rabby](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/zx1yqe/daily_general_discussion_december_28_2022/j1zc0zv/)\n3. [Tally Ho](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/100d6c2/daily_general_discussion_january_1_2023/j2jdzfl/)\n4. [Metamask](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1014ypw/comment/j2nf0mt/) (or [view on Caches](https://caches.xyz/the-rostrum/metamask-browser-extension-basic-security-analysis/))\n\nIm happy to report that after blocking the listed domains as described in the first listed post, I am still able to use my Ledger device to send and receive as normal.\n\nOk here's the deal. Analyzing Frame is on my plate, but it is a bit of a different beast being a desktop application that connects to the browser extension. \n\nI have always been a Firefox and Metamask user, and wanted to know more about how it works.\n\nI followed the same steps as before to download and analyze the extension, which can be found at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn\n\nhttps://imgur.com/JJRPty5\n\nWhen installed, MetaMask immediately contacts Ankr's API, obtaining chain information very similarly to Tally Ho.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a7yjGIE\n\nAgain, a request to the Avalanche network that is almost identical to the one sent by Tally Ho.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/5hmC6Pk\n\nMetaMask grabs a few phishing domain lists.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/sPkEw13\n\nmin-api.cryptocompare.com is used as a price feed for ETH\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BWFpW02\n\nThis domain must handle a ton of requests.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/cIDfSBk\n\nAbove is the first request to youtube generated by MetaMask. It loads https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVgfHZMFFFQ 'What is MetaMask?' as an intro to MetaMask video.\n\nNOTE:\n\nIn my previous post, I claimed that the cookie highlighted in the above image is 'hardcoded, or generated on the fly by MetaMask itself'. This is incorrect, apologies to the MetaMask team. This is a standard cookie that youtube.com sets, which I likely introduced to chrome prior to installation of MetaMask. I will be much more careful with my environmental controls if I continue on with this series.\n\nMetaMask silently loads every piece of javascript youtube has to offer, so we again meet our friend https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleclick.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/uikkstC\n\nThere are quite a few requests to doubleclick. In fairness to MetaMask, I could not find anything that leads me to believe that they are using it to track you. This is youtube's tracking at work.\n\nThough, for context as to why I still find this so offensive I must link my personal cybersecurity blogpost pertaining to javascript https://fistfulofsecurity.blogspot.com/2021/06/detecting-cve-2018-16938-noscript-bypass.html\n\nIf you wish to see some examples of what offensive and defensive security look like, check out my other posts there. Still all very basic stuff.\n\nNow lets take a look at some of the requests to Sentry.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/nrWubmG\n\nThis is the first request, doesnt look like user activity tracking to me. Though, they do collect your browser User-Agent.\n\nNot a huge deal, but consider what /u/0xDepositContract has to [say](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1014ypw/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2023/j2oltt9/).\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Bi8DjRE\n\nWe see a similar request to Sentry soon after, with the sid and time values having changed. Also notice the response is 429 Too Many Requests.\n\nAnd below you can see what is sent to Sentry when you unexpectedly close your browser.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/438yHXt\n\nNow beginning the process of creating a new seed phrase, I chose to allow telemetry. I believe that everything should be secure by default, and want to see the worst case scenario.\n\nWe immediately see the below request.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Ert1qRl\n\nNow this is user activity tracking. Not with Sentry, but Segment!\n\nMetaMask is reporting that the extension is successfully installed. Also notice the highlighted 'userId' field and value.\n\nNext up we see the request having to do with 'Metrics Opt In'.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/6wLlkha\n\nWhats up with the null 'anonymousId'? Odd considering below you can see we're back to the orignal 'userId'.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/5Sno0D6\n\nThis request notifies Segment that Im on the page asking if I want to import or create a seed.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/kHtEKcV\n\nHere is confirmation that I created a wallet password. \n\nNow what happens when we connect MetaMask to staking.synthetix.io?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/xuts7VW\n\nOf course it tracks the dapps you use. Alright you get the picture. There are a few more requests like this, and it clearly very closely tracks how you use the wallet.\n\nBut Mr. PortaPotty, who in their right mind enables telemetry? Well, lets look take a look under the hood without telemetry.\n\nThe traffic to Sentry still exists and seems the same, but it at least doesnt track more than your browser's User-Agent.\n\nMuch more importantly, there is not a request to Segment in sight!\n\nI have confirmed that blocking sentry.io using the method described in my Ledger Live post still allows MetaMask to transact correctly.\n\n/u/Tricky_Troll also asked some great [questions](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1014ypw/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2023/j2qlkk4/), which I will attempt to answer here.\n\nIts important to remember that when you install MetaMask in chrome you give it the following permissions:\n\nRead and change all your data on all websites\n\nDisplay notifications\n\nModify data you copy and paste\n\nMetaMask has the ability to read all of your cookies, but what it does with that info is what really matters. As shown, I cant find any reason to think that they are misusing it.\n\nMetaMask, being an extension, is in a very privileged position security-wise. Any remotely secure browser would not allow website A to read your cookies set by website B.\n\nHowever, I would love to now go into how google bypasses this to track you. Note, the following has nothing to do with MetaMask.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/C2jRtEF\n\nSee the 'X-Client-Data' header in this request to youtube? This is a custom HTTP header created by google, for use across their entire infrastructure. If you read the Doubleclick wiki page, you may recall that they were acquired by google.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/EHaygjH\n\nAnd here we see youtube.com telling chrome to send a request to doubleclick with that tracking header, as can be verified by checking the 'Referer' header.\n\nWhile using firefox does not make you immune to google's tracking, it sure as hell beats serving up all of your data on a [silver platter](https://9to5google.com/2020/02/06/google-chrome-x-client-data-tracking/).\n\nStay safe, folks!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wanted to post this as a separate thread as suggested by <a href=\"/u/LogrisTheBard\">/u/LogrisTheBard</a>, but it keeps getting removed.</p>\n\n<p>This will serve as a re-write of my terribly flawed analysis of MetaMask.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Apologies to the MetaMask team, <a href=\"/u/REALJohnBMacLemore\">/u/REALJohnBMacLemore</a> for his effort, anyone who may have switched wallets as a result of my post, and this subreddit in general.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/sm3gh34d\">/u/sm3gh34d</a> posed a very good <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1014ypw/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2023/j2o6ta6/\">question</a>, wondering how I know that MetaMask uses Sentry for tracking purposes.</p>\n\n<p>My <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1014ypw/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2023/j2o9gl6/\">response</a>, was specific to Rabby.

Which if true is super bullish for ETH outside of Ethereum.\n\nAdditionally, as I understand it, you could earn the ETH staking rewards, \\*as well as\\* retaking it to earn other protocol rewards (from other chains, oracles, etc)\n\nTwo examples protocols of this would be:- Eigen Layer: [https://www.eigenlayer.com/](https://www.eigenlayer.com/)(a good article on Eigen [https://consensys.net/blog/cryptoeconomic-research/eigenlayer-a-restaking-primitive/](https://consensys.net/blog/cryptoeconomic-research/eigenlayer-a-restaking-primitive/))- And Obol: [https://obol.tech/](https://obol.tech/)\n\nBut not exclusive to those two.\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts or street smarts on the real use case of this? Would you consider doing Eth re-staking to earn other protocol rewards in addition to the ETH validation rewards, or is this something you wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole?\n\nIs this one of the big bullish cases for ETH?

Was hanging out with <a href=\"/u/jtnichol\">u/jtnichol</a> and he recommended I ask a question here, so here we go.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does anyone here know much about ETH re-staking?</strong></p>\n\n<p>From my understanding this is a way to use ETH&#39;s POS to do more than just validate transactions on Ethereum (and L2s) but also to validate much much more; from unrelated chains, oracles, and even things potentially beyond crypto. Which if true is super bullish for ETH outside of Ethereum.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, as I understand it, you could earn the ETH staking rewards, *as well as* retaking it to earn other protocol rewards (from other chains, oracles, etc)</p>\n\n<p>Two examples protocols of this would be:- Eigen Layer: <a href=\"https://www.eigenlayer.com/\">https://www.eigenlayer.com/</a>(a good article on Eigen <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/cryptoeconomic-research/eigenlayer-a-restaking-primitive/\">https://consensys.net/blog/cryptoeconomic-research/eigenlayer-a-restaking-primitive/</a>)- And Obol: <a href=\"https://obol.tech/\">https://obol.tech/</a></p>\n\n<p>But not exclusive to those two.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have thoughts or street smarts on the real use case of this? Would you consider doing Eth re-staking to earn other protocol rewards in addition to the ETH validation rewards, or is this something you wouldn&#39;t touch with a 10 foot pole?</p>\n\n<p>Is this one of the big bullish cases for ETH?
