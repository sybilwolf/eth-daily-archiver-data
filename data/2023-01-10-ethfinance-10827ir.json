The decentralization and &#39;legitimacy&#39; of Ethereum the network, and by extention, ether the asset is compromized, meaning it is less likely to be as highly valued in the future. Sure, you could take the high ground and not use a centralized service, but then are you disadvantaging yourself with lost opportunity cost. And if you do, and most people chose a centralized service then you still lose out from the loss of perceived legitimacy anyway...</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Except that entire scenario is not analogous to Ethereum staking today due to another option, that hopefully most of you have been hearing repeat in your heads the entire time you&#39;ve been reading. Rocketpool solves the lose-lose coordination failure, by providing an option that gives people the ability to access an LSD without compromising the decentralization of the whole.

The only way to ensure honesty is to enforce honesty, not expect honesty. This is why every centralized bank and every government FIAT currency eventually fails. Once the enforcers of honesty are corrupted, the system is no longer working as intended (or begins working as intended if you are a pessimist like me).\n\nHumans are naturally capable of both good and bad, but are generally more inclined towards selfishness than evil. Our nature does not change, but it can behave differently depending on the circumstances we face. While we can be rational, we can also act irrationally. Society is shaped by conscious decisions and not the other way around.

It's meant to be a platform for currencies.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Peters perspective relates to currency, and I largely agree with his take. I do not expect ETH to become a currency used for international economic activity (outside of the onchain economy). However, I believe Ethereum as a platform will be used by nation states for their digital dollars, and I agree with Peter that decentralization of national currencies in this sense is undesirable because of inflation inherent with limited supplies and the lack of mechanism to alter the supply according to economic externalities. </p>\n\n<p>As far as the Ether supply goes, it fluctuates based on the on-chain economy. No activity on Ethereum? The supply goes up. Lots of activity? The supply goes down. It&#39;s a self correcting mechanism for Ethereums on-chain economy. However, the price of ETH does not affect the relative price of potential digital currencies which are centrally managed but still onchain.</p>\n\n<p>Contrast this to Bitcoin, where the maximalist idea is to have hyperbitcoinization and to be used as a global currency to replace national currencies. This is its only narrative because there is no on-chain economy for Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>So ETH being deflationary is not a problem because it&#39;s not trying to be a currency.

This multiplier depends on a lot of different things such as liquidity, sentiment, etc., it\u2019s not a constant.  Even for a given coin it will change over time.</p>\n\n<p>For a fairly liquid asset, I\u2019ve heard that a multiplier of 10 is a reasonable first approximation.  Meaning every $1 of sell pressure drops the market cap by $10.  $2B of sell pressure on a coin with a $1B market cap would drop it to sub-zero levels.</p>\n\n<p>Of course if you liquidated it slowly, over a very long period of time, you could do it without crashing the price to zero, but what ends up happening is going to depend heavily on sentiment, market conditions, etc. and can\u2019t really be predicted.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-10 20:16:58","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-01-10 20:25:42","id":"j3un8xn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10827ir","parent_id":"t1_j3uiewo","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/the_statustician","body":"You need more information, such as demand, the buy side of the order book over time","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You need more information, such as demand, the buy side of the order book over time</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-10 21:52:11","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j3uxwmw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10827ir","parent_id":"t1_j3uiewo","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/RobertLobLaw2","body":"Does anyone know of a way for someone in the US to sell ETHW?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Does anyone know of a way for someone in the US to sell ETHW?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-10 20:18:07","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j3une1c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10827ir","parent_id":"t3_10827ir","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/suicidaleggroll","body":"Kraken","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Kraken</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-10 20:24:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j3uo4fj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10827ir","parent_id":"t1_j3une1c","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Fast_Contract","body":"welp, all of a sudden, out of nowhere I'm getting\n\nERROR - Could not find latest valid execution payload hash (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000) in the non-finalized chain.
