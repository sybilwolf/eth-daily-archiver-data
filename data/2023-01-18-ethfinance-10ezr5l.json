Over time, this murky wisp of guidance has been discussed ad nauseam resulting in countless opinions, the most conservative of which have resulted in this mantra we repeat over and over again to the point where we apply its meaning to nearly all possible transactions in DeFi and I am arguing that we are doing ourselves a disservice by doing so.\n\nIn addition I see several things wrong with this line of thinking.\n\n1. When we say this we are trying to mind-read essentially a single paragraph of guidance from an institution that is so far behind the novel mechanics of these economic transactions that it is trying to jam a new cryptoeconomic system into old rules which *may not necessarily* apply.\n2. Not a single tax case has taken place to give us additional guidance on this measure and given point 1, clearly the courts will need to decide where certain crypto transactions fit within the old framework and *where they do not*, so let us not be our own prosecutor before the issue has even been brought to dispute.\n3. The *underlying* purpose of this tax rule is so that investors cannot jump from one investment to another across wildly different risk profiles and domains without paying taxes on their economic profit, *it is not arbitrary*. Therefore, I would encourage us to adopt the thinking that this general guideline - i.e., that *most* crypto to crypto transactions *are* taxable - *derives* from this principle. So let us not replace the inspiration  here - to tax a \"closed economic position that has gain\" - with its practical attempt to regulate it.\n4. It is entirely conceivable that certain economically identical transactions and positions can both issue or not issue a token to represent the position. It would not make sense or serve justice for one of these to be taxable and the other to not be taxable, merely because one of the dapps decided to issue a token to represent the position instead of merely keeping an account of the position on chain.\n5. Specifically, with respect to rETH, we can imagine a Rocketpool clone which does not issue rETH but instead simply shows what your \"staked ETH\" value is accruing at until you withdraw. I would argue it is impossible to justify taxing one of these without taxing the other.\n6. I believe it stems from this line of reasoning that while most crypto to crypto transactions are taxable that some are not. Here is a non-inclusive list - ETH to wETH, ETH to rETH, *the initiation of* a Uniswap LP position, the staking of SUSHI for xSUSHI. The underlying idea here is that the agent is still exposed to the full underlying risk profile of the asset, they have not disposed of the asset but rather they are *doing something* with the asset. The same cannot be said, for example, for an ETH to BTC transaction, or an ETH to USDC transaction.\n\nI'm interested in discussion and I have brought up this point in the past - each time I try to articulate myself better because I don't feel that it has always been clearly understood.\n\nAgain, my claim is simply this: there is a reasonable argument to be made that not all so-called crypto to crypto transactions are taxable events and at the same time I acknowledge that we are dealing in incredibly murky territory. All I'm asking is that we not continue under the illusion that the murkiness is actually crystal clear guidance that has clear unobjectionable  meaning for every single type of transaction in this brand new cryptoeconomic landscape.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>This post was inspired by <a href=\"/u/hipaces\">/u/hipaces</a> implication yesterday that ETH to rETH is a taxable event.</p>\n\n<p>I see here repeated a conjecture which over time has morphed into myth and ossified into fact and I would like to dispute it - the idea that <em>merely</em> by receiving a token in representing a DeFi position, that this in fact constitutes a <em>taxable event</em> (at least as it pertains to so-called US tax &quot;guidance&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>This thinking has originated primarily from IRS guidance which came out years ago essentially saying that crypto to crypto transactions are not like-kind exchanges and shall not be treated as such after January 1, 2018. Over time, this murky wisp of guidance has been discussed ad nauseam resulting in countless opinions, the most conservative of which have resulted in this mantra we repeat over and over again to the point where we apply its meaning to nearly all possible transactions in DeFi and I am arguing that we are doing ourselves a disservice by doing so.</p>\n\n<p>In addition I see several things wrong with this line of thinking.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When we say this we are trying to mind-read essentially a single paragraph of guidance from an institution that is so far behind the novel mechanics of these economic transactions that it is trying to jam a new cryptoeconomic system into old rules which <em>may not necessarily</em> apply.</li>\n<li>Not a single tax case has taken place to give us additional guidance on this measure and given point 1, clearly the courts will need to decide where certain crypto transactions fit within the old framework and <em>where they do not</em>, so let us not be our own prosecutor before the issue has even been brought to dispute.</li>\n<li>The <em>underlying</em> purpose of this tax rule is so that investors cannot jump from one investment to another across wildly different risk profiles and domains without paying taxes on their economic profit, <em>it is not arbitrary</em>. Therefore, I would encourage us to adopt the thinking that this general guideline - i.e., that <em>most</em> crypto to crypto transactions <em>are</em> taxable - <em>derives</em> from this principle. So let us not replace the inspiration  here - to tax a &quot;closed economic position that has gain&quot; - with its practical attempt to regulate it.</li>\n<li>It is entirely conceivable that certain economically identical transactions and positions can both issue or not issue a token to represent the position. It would not make sense or serve justice for one of these to be taxable and the other to not be taxable, merely because one of the dapps decided to issue a token to represent the position instead of merely keeping an account of the position on chain.</li>\n<li>Specifically, with respect to rETH, we can imagine a Rocketpool clone which does not issue rETH but instead simply shows what your &quot;staked ETH&quot; value is accruing at until you withdraw. I would argue it is impossible to justify taxing one of these without taxing the other.</li>\n<li>I believe it stems from this line of reasoning that while most crypto to crypto transactions are taxable that some are not. Here is a non-inclusive list - ETH to wETH, ETH to rETH, <em>the initiation of</em> a Uniswap LP position, the staking of SUSHI for xSUSHI. The underlying idea here is that the agent is still exposed to the full underlying risk profile of the asset, they have not disposed of the asset but rather they are <em>doing something</em> with the asset. The same cannot be said, for example, for an ETH to BTC transaction, or an ETH to USDC transaction.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&#39;m interested in discussion and I have brought up this point in the past - each time I try to articulate myself better because I don&#39;t feel that it has always been clearly understood.</p>\n\n<p>Again, my claim is simply this: there is a reasonable argument to be made that not all so-called crypto to crypto transactions are taxable events and at the same time I acknowledge that we are dealing in incredibly murky territory.

Obviously it\u2019s not ideal for the end user but pretty much nothing in crypto taxes is already.</p>\n\n<p>At a high level though my overall point is that I think its unlikely anyone will get severely dinged for not calling it a taxable event at time of deposit, as long as they pay taxes on the gains earned eventually. And more generally that people should be thinking about how to approach taxes as a strategy, rather trying to follow hard rules, because not even the IRS knows what the rules are in many cases, so it\u2019s silly of us to try and say we do. If your strategy is to be conservative and pay ever deposit, have at it. If your strategy is to pay only after withdrawals that\u2019s probably fine too.
