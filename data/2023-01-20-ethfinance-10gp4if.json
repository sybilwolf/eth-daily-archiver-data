Both super basic, but I can&#39;t stress enough how much of a newbie I am with Linux... so it was a comfy start. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d also like to keep this quasi-weekly thing going, so if anyone else is trying going down their staking journey feel free to jump in.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-20 10:48:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j56ezbm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10gp4if","parent_id":"t3_10gp4if","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"Great to here!

Rugs and hacks are everywhere for the reasons I cover in my [Rabbit Hole](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole) post. You see multi-million dollar hacks on bridges and contracts several times a year, bear or bull. So you can forgive most people from not trusting Defi enough to put a sizable amount of their life savings in.\n\nWhen I talk to reasonably risk-adverse people about what is stopping them from trying Defi the usual responses center about regulation first and insurance second. On the former I'll simply say you can't regulate the likes of FTX when it's outside the US and the harder the SEC makes it for companies to develop legitimately inside the US the more it pushes its citizens to opportunities outside its jurisdiction. Regulation is simply unlikely to help this space or you in particular any time soon.\n\nInsurance faces a different problem. First, Defi insurance to date faces some terrible UX issues. People are not used to thinking of insurance like prediction markets even if they can be structured as such. Asking them to mint three tokens and sell one of them is simply more confusing than streaming money to a contract and feeling like you're covered (whether or not you are). Second, it faces some capital efficiency issues. This is due to the simple issue that the collateral they use so far has not been inherently interest bearing. If you have to hold NXM to be an insurer the person on the other side of the contract has to pay at least as much as lower risk opportunities. Since there are reasonably safe 8-10% APR ETH or stablecoin opportunities out there, using your capital for insurance instead has to pay even more than that. When I've looked into it you'll lose like 80% of your Defi yield trying to buy insurance on your position if it's even an option.\n\nWithout that option what can the average person do to protect themselves in Defi? I'm not going to tell you to get good at reading Solidity and audits. Rather I think each person should define their risk framework and diversify their funds amongst opportunities that meet the criteria within it. I once had the unenviable position of using machine learning to build software whitelists. The signals we used for heuristically trusting software there are largely applicable to Defi as well. Here are the big ones:\n\n1) How widely distributed is the software? How many users does it have? In Defi this translates to TVL, it's the size of the payday hackers would get if there is a smart contract exploit.\n\n2) How long ago did we first see it? How long has the industry had to look it over and determine if it is safe? This is unchanged for Defi.\n\n3) Is the software registered with us and claimed by a trusted party? This is basically audits like Trail of Bits or things like your [Defi Safety score.](https://defisafety.com/)\n\nI'm going to boldly state if you are a reasonably risk-adverse person and a smart contract doesn't have an audit yet you shouldn't be putting money in it. So that let's us focus on the other two which have more personal answers. An easy first question for someone dipping their toes in Defi then is whether the likes of Aave or Compound meets their safety threshold by these criteria. They have multiple billions of TVL, have been deployed for multiple years, and as yet have had basically no issues other than *minor* losses on liquidation insolvency. If that isn't good enough for you then Defi isn't the place for your money; no point looking any further. You can stop at just holding native ETH for price speculation and that's ok.\n\nIf the answer is yes though, then you can go down the protocol list in [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/) and hunt for opportunities for the assets you are willing to hold. Outside of insurance and basic risk awareness the only other tool available to you is diversification. Find a spread of opportunities such that you can afford to lose all the money in one of them and still be made whole in a few years. If you're using things like Curve LPs you need to check what your exposure to a given centralized asset like USDT is as well as your exposure to any given platform. For me this process results in over 10 stablecoin positions with yields in excess of inflation last year.\n\nDiversifying in this way has saved my ass. Last year I had my first ever Defi rug/implosion with Bancor v3. My issue, outside of just excitement of new toys, was that I gave the team credit on my risk framework for their Bancor v2 product running several years with hundreds of millions of TVL. In hindsight, even without Bancor v3 the 3AC implosion was ultimately what wrecked the price of BNT and took down Bancor. Bancor v3 just split liquidity and made the protocol particularly vulnerable to it. Unlucky timing but the crux of the problem was reckless BNT issuance the previous years not actually the new product. The good news is, even though I put in more than I should have according to the age of the Bancor v3 I still only put in my smallest size slice of capital. As a result, it only took about 6 months of farming interest to make me whole and I'm alive to tell you about it. This is what it means to be your own investment bank.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Defi is a scary place to most people.

They have multiple billions of TVL, have been deployed for multiple years, and as yet have had basically no issues other than <em>minor</em> losses on liquidation insolvency. If that isn&#39;t good enough for you then Defi isn&#39;t the place for your money; no point looking any further. You can stop at just holding native ETH for price speculation and that&#39;s ok.</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes though, then you can go down the protocol list in <a href=\"https://defillama.com/\">DefiLlama</a> and hunt for opportunities for the assets you are willing to hold. Outside of insurance and basic risk awareness the only other tool available to you is diversification. Find a spread of opportunities such that you can afford to lose all the money in one of them and still be made whole in a few years. If you&#39;re using things like Curve LPs you need to check what your exposure to a given centralized asset like USDT is as well as your exposure to any given platform. For me this process results in over 10 stablecoin positions with yields in excess of inflation last year.</p>\n\n<p>Diversifying in this way has saved my ass. Last year I had my first ever Defi rug/implosion with Bancor v3. My issue, outside of just excitement of new toys, was that I gave the team credit on my risk framework for their Bancor v2 product running several years with hundreds of millions of TVL. In hindsight, even without Bancor v3 the 3AC implosion was ultimately what wrecked the price of BNT and took down Bancor. Bancor v3 just split liquidity and made the protocol particularly vulnerable to it. Unlucky timing but the crux of the problem was reckless BNT issuance the previous years not actually the new product. The good news is, even though I put in more than I should have according to the age of the Bancor v3 I still only put in my smallest size slice of capital. As a result, it only took about 6 months of farming interest to make me whole and I&#39;m alive to tell you about it. This is what it means to be your own investment bank.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-01-19 22:31:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j5437yl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_10gp4if","parent_id":"t3_10gp4if","score":46,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/DoubtStarsAreFire","body":"I submit to you Logris ~~daily~~ ^(weekly) wall of text.
