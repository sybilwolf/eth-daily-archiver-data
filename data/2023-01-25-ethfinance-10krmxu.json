First, it's an obvious implementation, so it's likely to catch on quickly. Second, it offers on-chain privacy to enterprise actors.

You probably can't invest directly in Nightfall, but you can recognize that Ethereum is the ultimate settlement layer for these solutions. There is some question about whether polygon will Integrate deeply with Ethereum as a settlement layer, but I'm confident that only settlement on Ethereum will offer enterprise grade security. To make a story short, the obvious investment direction is Ether.\n\n* How can I get involved?\n\nNightfall is early but it's nearing full deployment.
