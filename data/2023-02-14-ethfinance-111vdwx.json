It's exciting and I'm already daydreaming of how am I going to get that money into my bank account! One fun thing to try would be to swap USDC for EURE and use Monerium to permissionlessly send EUR to my bank.\n\nBut a bigger concern of mine is privacy. I'm not really fond of the idea of my paycheck getting permanently recorded on a public blockchain. Of course, I will use a blank address, but still at the very least the fiat off-ramp will be able to see who I work for.\n\nI'm aware of two options:\n\n### 1. Tornado Cash\n\nA battle-tested mixer that I fully trust. However, on mainnet it can become very expensive with congestion ($100+ fees on the last bull market) and I'd like to be able to store it there long term without worrying about whether withdrawing in the future will be costly.\n\nThe mainnet liquidity is decent on the 1K DAI and 10K DAI pools (much smaller than ETH, but still enough IMO) with relatively recent deposits (< 1 month). The USDC liqudity is bad, with the most recent deposits being ~6 months ago, which means that I'd have to swap USDC -> DAI, incurring in fees.\n\nThe alt-L1s and L2s are a no-no. Most of them only have ETH (or the native asset) as their only asset, and I wouldn't like to store my paycheck in a volatile asset (as much as I'm bullish on ETH). Gnosis Chain could be a candidate, given that the native asset is xDAI, but the liquidity is not great, also with no deposits in 6 months.\n\nAlso, Tornado has a handy compliance feature that I could use to prove the origin of my funds. I'm not planning to evade taxes, just to protect the flow of my money from prying eyes.\n\nIf I were to use Tornado Cash, my best shot would probably be the 1K DAI pool, but that would incur in considerable fees.\n\n### 2. Aztec (zk.money)\n\nAztec seems like what I need, as I can deposit DAI and withdraw to another wallet. The fees don't seem too bad (~$1.60 for a deposit from mainnet) but I'm not sure if they would scale with L1 congestion.\n\nAztec doesn't seem to really be integrated with the rest of the L2 ecosystem (I can't bridge from an L2 via Hop for example), nor I don't know any CEX that supports depositing from it.\n\nIt doesn't seem as battle tested as Tornado. Believe it or not, Tornado seems much more straightforward to me. Even though the flow is quite complex (with relayers, notes...) I know what every element of it does exactly. Aztec does seem more like an experimental black box to me. Also, I don't know how does it compare to Tornado in the privacy side. For example, I don't know where to look to find out how many people are depositing and withdrawing DAI, how much, and how frequently.\n\nOn the flip side, Aztec is not as big, so it doesn't raise the attention of regulators as much.\n\n### 3. Other options?\n\nThere may be some options that I'm missing. Maybe atomic swap into Monero, then Monero to CEX? Is that even possible from Ethereum? Or maybe USDC -> renZEC -> ZCash -> CEX?\n\n### War on privacy?\n\nI'm not really worried about the OFAC sanctions as I live in Europe. And since I'm not planning to do anything illegal, I'm not concerned about authorities potentially asking me questions (if I'm self-employed, and all my money comes from crypto... surely that's unusual)\n\nHowever, one potential concern is that exchanges or fiat off-ramps could unilaterally decide that they don't want to deal with money that has gone through mixers. If everyone collectively agrees that Tornado ETH is worthless, then it becomes worthless. P2P will always be an option, but still... That wouldn't be ideal.\n\nI guess Circle should always honor redemptions of USDC even if it came from Tornado, so maybe as long as I don't swap out of USDC I could be fine.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is privacy even worth the effort?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Last week I started working for a DAO and next month I should get my first paycheck in USDC to an address of my choice on a network of my choice.

Or maybe USDC -&gt; renZEC -&gt; ZCash -&gt; CEX?</p>\n\n<h3>War on privacy?</h3>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not really worried about the OFAC sanctions as I live in Europe. And since I&#39;m not planning to do anything illegal, I&#39;m not concerned about authorities potentially asking me questions (if I&#39;m self-employed, and all my money comes from crypto... surely that&#39;s unusual)</p>\n\n<p>However, one potential concern is that exchanges or fiat off-ramps could unilaterally decide that they don&#39;t want to deal with money that has gone through mixers. If everyone collectively agrees that Tornado ETH is worthless, then it becomes worthless. P2P will always be an option, but still... That wouldn&#39;t be ideal.</p>\n\n<p>I guess Circle should always honor redemptions of USDC even if it came from Tornado, so maybe as long as I don&#39;t swap out of USDC I could be fine.</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think? Is privacy even worth the effort?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-14 07:33:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j8ig5kv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_111vdwx","parent_id":"t3_111vdwx","score":31,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Set1Less","body":"Checkout railgun too","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Checkout railgun too</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-14 07:58:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j8ijv44","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_111vdwx","parent_id":"t1_j8ig5kv","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sfcpfc","body":"Nice, thanks for sharing.

It is a tax on the very poor to benefit the slightly less poor.  It reduces employment, it reduces hours.   You can't overwrite the laws of supply and demand by legislative fiat.  It's wishful thinking to believe you can.\n\n> Do you believe in laws that mandate health benefits to full time employees?\n\nAbsolutely not.  This has been one of the most harmful policies in our nation's history.  Take the tax benefits away from employers, give them to individuals, get rid of mandatory coverages, and allow interstate competition and watch prices drop and quality go up.  How do we know this? Because the things that are not covered by insurance but require the exact same medical skills have been dropping in price for better quality.  The real world matters.\n\n> Laws that mandate breaks during long shifts? \n\nI think any employee that wants to work without a break for extra pay should be allowed to.  But if we deem it a safety issue, then breaks should be mandatory.  But certainly we can give a choice to employees that aren't risking the health of others.\n\n> Laws that mandate maternity leave?\n\nEconomists have studied this.  Every place that has implemented mandatory maternity leave has led to reduced employment for women of child bearing age.   So no, I don't think we should make it harder for young women to get jobs.\n\n> I believe strongly that the economic concept of inequality of bargaining power \n\nMost of the inequality is exactly BECAUSE OF these types of regulations.  That's why big corporations support these laws.  It harms small employers more than big ones, giving the big ones a competitive advantage, and giving people who want job flexibility and better benefits fewer choices.\n\nReality matters.  This has been studied endlessly, and every attempt to fix these so-called \"problems\" ends up harming the people they were meant to help.   Enough.  We need to stop harming the poor and powerless in the name of helping the poor and powerless.  It's immoral and harmful.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The majority have no choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the US, yes, they do.  Shop around.

No employer says no to a good worker.</p>\n\n<p>If you mean that they have no choice if they refuse to change anything in their lives, then yeah, I guess technically that is true, but it has nothing to do with reality.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I take it that you also don\u2019t believe in the minimum wage, right? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Right.  It is a tax on the very poor to benefit the slightly less poor.  It reduces employment, it reduces hours.   You can&#39;t overwrite the laws of supply and demand by legislative fiat.  It&#39;s wishful thinking to believe you can.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you believe in laws that mandate health benefits to full time employees?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Absolutely not.  This has been one of the most harmful policies in our nation&#39;s history.  Take the tax benefits away from employers, give them to individuals, get rid of mandatory coverages, and allow interstate competition and watch prices drop and quality go up.  How do we know this? Because the things that are not covered by insurance but require the exact same medical skills have been dropping in price for better quality.  The real world matters.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Laws that mandate breaks during long shifts? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think any employee that wants to work without a break for extra pay should be allowed to.  But if we deem it a safety issue, then breaks should be mandatory.  But certainly we can give a choice to employees that aren&#39;t risking the health of others.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Laws that mandate maternity leave?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Economists have studied this.  Every place that has implemented mandatory maternity leave has led to reduced employment for women of child bearing age.   So no, I don&#39;t think we should make it harder for young women to get jobs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe strongly that the economic concept of inequality of bargaining power </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most of the inequality is exactly BECAUSE OF these types of regulations.  That&#39;s why big corporations support these laws.  It harms small employers more than big ones, giving the big ones a competitive advantage, and giving people who want job flexibility and better benefits fewer choices.</p>\n\n<p>Reality matters.  This has been studied endlessly, and every attempt to fix these so-called &quot;problems&quot; ends up harming the people they were meant to help.   Enough.  We need to stop harming the poor and powerless in the name of helping the poor and powerless.  It&#39;s immoral and harmful.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-16 13:57:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"j8tqwwz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_111vdwx","parent_id":"t1_j8t6syk","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"There isn\u2019t anything sane about conservatism.
