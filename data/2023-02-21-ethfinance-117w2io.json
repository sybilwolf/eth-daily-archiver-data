Today I started looking at the <a href=\"https://salsa.me/\">Salsa app</a> after <a href=\"/u/alexiskef\">/u/alexiskef</a> brought it up, it looks like a POAP messaging app.. something that might be fun at home, but AWESOME at somewhere like EthDenver.</p>\n\n<p>To use the app, you have to connect your POAP wallet and it looks like Metamask and Argent are the web apps I can use to connect. </p>\n\n<p>I think I can use a Ledger nano S with a USB-C to micro USB adapter to connect to metamask mobile and connect my wallet.. Does anyone else have experience with this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>update:</strong> Success! I was able to log into salsa using a Ledger Nano S connected to the Ledger Live app on my Pixel phone using a usb-c to micro usb adapter.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-21 08:03:50","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-02-21 14:54:47","id":"j9fmn8l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_117w2io","parent_id":"t3_117w2io","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Give it a shot! \n\nFor poaps I had to make security concessions personally for convenience..  ended up with a minimally funded throwaway metamask wallet on mobile and will mint via gnosis/arbitrum so I can consolidate to my normal poap wallet on the cheap post event","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Give it a shot! </p>\n\n<p>For poaps I had to make security concessions personally for convenience..  ended up with a minimally funded throwaway metamask wallet on mobile and will mint via gnosis/arbitrum so I can consolidate to my normal poap wallet on the cheap post event</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-02-21 08:22:37","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-02-21 16:21:46","id":"j9fpgs6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_117w2io","parent_id":"t1_j9fmn8l","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"I'm having a lot of luck using a Ledger Nano X (the bluetooth one, but I have it connected over usbc.)

It was never intended to be an \"Ethereum killer\" like so many other EVM chains claimed to be, but rather an interoperability layer that will trustlessly tie all other networks together and provide unique functionality along the way. \n\nPolkadot excels at three things IMO: cross consensus messaging, flexibility of design, and allowing non-financialized apps to secure high quality blockspace.  That is to say the Polkadot ecosystem is a made up of parachains that are highly specialized and optimized for specific functions, and then the general purpose smart contract apps can trustlessly bridge in those functions like legos to make make highly performant apps without having to reinvent every individual component.\n\nWhere Moonbeam fits in is it allows existing EVM projects or developers to easily port their code over and enjoy the benefits that projects are seeing with other L2s (cheap, fast, highly secure blockspace), while also being able to tap in to these other functions from other parachains.
