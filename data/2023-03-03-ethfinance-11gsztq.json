First day of the main event in the new venue. It's big, and so much going on! A lot of stages, tons of booths, a solid set of food options (though with all these people the lunch lines are never short), and if you wander around a bit you can easily get lost in some of the far back hallways. So loosening up the format just a smidge: I didn't find myself going to talks much but I can at least comment on the interesting booths I visited and people I talked to. With so many options, and with my relay stuff at the forefront of my mind, these are going to take a particular skew that maybe wasn't as apparent when I just sat at one stage all day and listened to whoever happened to be talking.\n\n* I visited [Blocknative's](https://www.blocknative.com/) booth and chatted with a lot of their team about relay stuff (maybe most notably, they really care about relays finding a sustainable business model). Also picked up on some of their other projects. Relay, builder, and mempool network of course, but also [wallet connection modal](https://www.blocknative.com/wallets), and proposed [\"Wallet Boost\" spec](https://github.com/blocknative/discourse/discussions/1) for user-searcher auctions. They've also apparently been helping to push [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), which is nice for account abstraction but clearly a a whole new world for MEV searchers. Validators: they have [a survey to gather sentiment about various aspects of PBS](https://www.freerangedao.xyz/), for some time when you have the keys to your deposit addresses available.\n* At [Rook's](https://www.rook.fi/) booth, they told me about their mempool/auction mechanism, similar in concept to SUAVE and the previously mentioned Wallet Boost. End users who submit transactions that will generate an MEV opportunity instead auction off the right to capture that MEV, so in the end the user gets paid for the MEV they're responsible for causing. It makes sense to me ethically that if anyone is entitled to take MEV, it's probably the end-users who create the opportunity in the first place.\n* I talked to someone working on a \"mempool provider\" called [Mevlink](https://mevlink.com/). This is a network of highly-connected and well-peered geth nodes that scan the mempool to identify new transactions as soon as possible, and can also propagate new transactions very quickly. Their main competition is apparently bloXroute, though Mevlink claims they're fairly significantly faster than bloXroute's network. I hadn't had this concept laid out cleanly in front of me before, makes sense though.\n* [Adam Stallard, Founder of BrightID](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/f267c3ce-42d2-4a55-93b3-e5a001d4bb83/80b8ec98-2c83-4108-837d-ab01f5fecaa2), gave a general overview of BrightID. I like BrightID but haven't been actively following it for a while. Despite its problems, I still haven't found a better system for large-scale Sybil-resistance. It sounds like Aura is pretty fully launched; I'd be curious if it's becoming a reliable way to get verified now.\n* I took my volunteer shift at the [Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net/) booth, which was fun! Got to explain minipools and LEB8's to a bunch of strangers, hand out tic-tacs, and hop on the bike in order to power their Proteus staking node. There was always a large crowd around, just from the RP team and community members standing around; it made for a nice hangout spot.\n* Chatted with Wander about the Node Operator Association, which has rebranded to [NodeSet](https://nodeset.io/) and is currently pursuing a project to help Rocket Pool [scale up its node operator count](https://nodeset.medium.com/project-hyperdrive-4819f22391dc).\n* At the [Opening Ceremony](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/dc7d4a00-baa4-42f4-a8b8-821f7be28bfa/57a2dcea-cf98-47cc-8b53-3054b15dd3bf), I stuck around through the opening comments, some (meh) standup, Jonathan Mann's \"Fuck SBF\" song, and the bufficorn stampede (in which people who paid $500 for a bufficorn onesie all got upgraded to sporkwhale tickets). Had to run an errand right as Jared Polis started talking; what did I miss after that?\n* Went to a side event called [Make MEV, Not (Latency) War](https://lu.ma/0r2wrzkj). It was certainly a good crowd for talking MEV, everyone had this shared extremely-specific knowledge which made it easy to talk shop. The venue itself was a little small for the number of people, got so loud it was hard to hold a conversation. Had a few talks there, in which a good amount of data and thoughts on latency were presented. A few notes: Blocknative doesn't think we're doomed to vertically-integrated MEV dystopia. There are big differences between time-based and bid-based ordering, bid-based generally being less subject to infinite latency wars than time-based. bloXroute is planning \"BX Relay Boost\" in which they use their BDN network to deliver blocks from relays to validators with reduced latency. It's okay to have people work to reduce latency (which is, in isolation, a good thing), but it should be bounded and becomes a problem when it [wastes resources](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/solana-spam-problems-persist-despite-150000212.html) or is [stupid](https://twitter.com/snoopy_mev/status/1629283898453811200).\n\nCurious if anyone went to Schelling Point and can share some thoughts. Also, folks in Denver should consider attending PizzaDAO's [Public Goods Pizza Party](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/public-goods-pizza-party-registration-554833029527) today (Friday), which Luau DAO is helping host. And shortly after at 6 PM, the EVM Happy Hour at [Cerebral Brewing](https://goo.gl/maps/q1LKw6JeWxheVXnW9).

I was only able to go yesterday and today due to work and kiddos school and all, and my overall impression is that the new location is way better, way more room, though wifi and cell networks really struggled. They also need more water stations. The overall atmosphere was different as well this year, last year it seemed more about public goods and diversity, this year ZK and other L2s, as well as wallets and gaming. Also the market def impacted the mood, way less monied exuberance and there wasn't a secret deadmau5 concert afaik. Wish I knew more people's faces cause what name tags were visible weren't always filled out with their online handles but IRL names. \n\nThey had childcare for those that signed up a couple weeks ago, which was awesome, a nice safe space with everything a kid or baby could need, so I was able to check my youngest in and go to talks and come back to check on him, so that was awesome. They even gave the kiddos free unlimited food.\n\nI wandered around and got the layout and where all the stalls and stages were yesterday, collected the stickers and other swag. Lens had a super popular booth, I assume folks assumed you could get a Lens invite (you couldn't). Coinbase Base had a whole room in the basement (the Base-ment ha). There was a DJ space always going, an art gallery, huge rooms of tables, a maker space, a snack and lounge space for Bufficorn holders and Spork whales, a hallway of board games. Huge area of computer games on chain. Circle, Polygon, ZK sync all had big fancy booths and lots of people always gathered there, optimism was a tiny table crammed in a corner. Lots of I assume YouTube crypto people based on them being followed by camera rigs and posing and stuff. A smart contract wallet called Ambire had onesies for my little, they were the only ones I found, though Cowswap was rumored to have them.\n\nToday I did talks and wandering. So this is what I listened to. \n\nProject Arrakis on the Defi stage (I was waiting for the next talk so only partially listening while people watching, trying to spot the Mai Finance artwork scavenger hunt shirts, the EthRank guy, and any EVMs. Also for anyone I might recognize, which is hard in this space since we're all on reddit, as the one guy I kept seeing is one of the Bankless guys, and I think maybe Sassal), balancing AMM liquidity across balancer, uni, lido and others. Launching PALM (protocol automated liquidity management) allow protocols to allow Treasury into say uniswap with a strategy flavor and parameters, set a manager and define their roles/limits since they are not custodians, vault owner vs manager, Cassandra.eth talked (I think that's what he said).\n\nDiva project by Pablo, started by discussing how staking is dominated by industry with 3 orgs having a huge percentage, rocketpool is admirable at 2.4% but there's need for recruitment and the bonds can be prohibitive and the pool gets full (current structure). DVT to the rescue! 2/3 of operators needed to attack so increasing that pool increases the required spread to takeover. Hit on how can you incentive validators and operators, deal with bad actors, and prevent loss of faith. To meet this, Diva is proposing smooth rewards to for all, bad actor rejection (quick, if operator offline for 2 days it's out), make nodes easily replaceable. Diva is a mix of liquid staking like lido and stakewise, DVT like SSV and obol, and economically trustless. Two sided staking pool, Diva Stakers stake via divETH LSD, 1 eth min currently. Diva operators can earn 2x base reward. Diva node runs on dappnode or docker is and is lightweight, can run on anything that can run the EL and CL clients  Stakers put into smart contract, 1 eth collateral to be operator. P2P operator network keys distributed between 16 nodes. Prototyping zero knowledge protocol oracles for rewards, zksnarks by Telepathy tool from succinct xyz. 16 nodes per validator, up to 5 can go offline with no impact to validator. Distributed keys, healing network from bad validators. Up to 10% apr. Trying to increase geographic diversity. Testnet this month, mainnet in a couple months. \n\nGalaxy Research: Staked eth withdrawals step by step by Christine Kim. Discussing full and partial withdrawals. Mostly familiar for regular readers here. Partial about every 100 hours. Queues for full and partials, 16 per block. Full withdrawal go thru exit queue then withdrawal queue. Showed a chart of 0x00 and 0x01 addresses, about half are still 0x00, lido has a large portion of the 0x01 set. Withdrawal credential processing is the same cap as withdrawals starting at Shanghai. Mentioned that slashed validators have another queue on top of the others for withdrawals.\n\nThe Secret of Ethereum liquid staking by Rocketpool by Langerstwit. I walked by the rocketpool booth a lot because I assumed folks from here would be there (u/waqwaqattack was there this morning!) and they had one of the Mai Finance scavenger hunt posters but had lost it for a while. Lots of very enthusiastic folks at the booth, they had a bike powered Proteus which I pedaled for a bit with my 5 month old strapped to my chest, and another guy stopped me to ask if I knew anything about rocketpool (they all did this), he was very enthusiastic and hinted at their Atlas announcement and LEB8 and upcoming dappnode support (I have a terrible memory for names, for all y'all in the rocketpool discord there's a picture of him in a EthStaker shirt signing a hoodie in the EthDenver channel). The presentation started with an overview of staking and why it's hard. Covered an overview of liquid staking and how it works. Covered how to swap and thus exit. Discussed risks to node operators and Stakers, how to minimize slashing risk. Announced Atlas upgrade, being able to move a solo validator with minimal code to 16 or 8 eth validator combos, requiring just the RPL deposit, as well as withdrawals per Shanghai, gas reductions. rETH will become more plentiful, 3-6x capacity (which will alleviate some of the concerns brought up earlier by Diva).\n\nData composablilty by Joel from ceramic (I wasn't expecting to hear this talk since he started when the ZK talk was scheduled, and the subject particulars is something on which I only understood a few word he said). Getting data out of the silos. Web2 (and current web3) apps are limited and have to use multiple apps which can fail. Permissionless acces to data enables composablilty. Ethereum enables contracts to always be there and not die. But eth is still siloing data. Going forward the user needs control of the data, it needs to be remixable, and can be used or revoked. Ceramic had the ComposeDB on they're mainnet. Ceramic is a web 3 data protocol with strong security signed by users. Seems aimed at devs I guess?\n\nSecurity and ZK roll ups Panel, with Riptide the white hat, Anthony from zksync, Sandy from Scroll, Coindesk Matt as mc. Mike from Simplify discussed the difference between optimistic versus ZK roll ups, the 7 day fraud proof versus ZK math crypto math. Zksync discussed risks, with any complex systems risks are thought of end to end, such as smart contracts and softwares and apps, key management, and the crypto is really hard for ZK roll ups and hard to audit because of the brains required to create and to audit. Riptide admits he can't understand the cryptography of it, talks about how his auditing focuses on the obvious forest for the trees stuff, like the teams do amazing math but aren't good at contract deployment. Sandy discussed how early we are in the space, many in crypto don't know what L2s are, and the teams are focusing on keeping security a constant eternal process. For ZKs they have to be secure from the start and forever, there's no Most Secure War. Scroll is working on byte code level zkevm, optimizing for Ethereum nativendss and devs. Zksync on how to resist those pushing to deploy quickly vs security requirements, timelines aren't hard coded. Mike hit on training wheels aka upgradeability, recommends everyone reads the audit report and trust assumptions and which specific snapshot was audited. Also watch the multisig and proper implementation of that wallet and upgrades. Recommended L2beats. Progressive take off the training wheels to make it immutable after a long while. Projects need to be clear with goals. Riptide says it's tough for users to correctly asses risks before using the system, recommends openess from projects. Bug bounties are needed and need to be paid. Sandy on the many zk projects, is it one take all or space for many, but it's hard to predict. The space is so small overall even in Ethereum now that it's hard to see projects giving up, but maybe once it's a massive space and if there's a special niche for just one thing. Anthony talked about opensource of their code to increase security vs other teams taking their code and data. \n\nDiva deployment demo, which struggled due to the wifi issues. Clean UI (looks like your typical crypto page on uniswap or a bridge), connect your wallet, decide how much eth to stake, see estimated returns, sign with your wallet and your validator is good to go. Also has option to run a node at the top, they couldn't really show that without the internet. The goal is to keep it as simple as possible, all you need is your wallet to stake so no separate key, no need to pick operators, just click and go (to compare with another DVT, SSV, to use them you pick your operators manually based on your criteria and their fee schedule and things like MEV and OFAC, so more involved). \n\n\nThat's about it for today, I had to leave to pick up my kids from school and of course it started snowing out of nowhere so traffic developed despite it being 40 degrees and not sticking. I wish I could have made the Hodlercon EVM pizza party & met everyone and got the EVM shirt.

Citing regulatory concerns.</p>\n\n<p>- Clarifying main project mission: art collection. The motto is &quot;Moonbirds is the art collector&#39;s PFP&quot;. This is a nice slogan, but a hard sell given that most of the well known art collectors have cryptopunks / BAYC PFPs instead.</p>\n\n<p>And a bunch of announcements regarding new mints and of new galleries coming to their Proof NFT gallery/marketplace. </p>\n\n<p>The floor price of the collection rose to ~7ETH with the hype, and subsequently dumped back down to 6.4 ETH, around to where it was pre announcement.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-03 03:27:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jaqs0af","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11gsztq","parent_id":"t3_11gsztq","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/PhiMarHal","body":"I love your NFT chronicles.
