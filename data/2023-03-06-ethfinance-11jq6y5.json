There were no traditional talks from established companies or researchers; today was all about the hackathon teams. Each project was submitted to one of five tracks (DeFi, Impact / Social Goods, DAOs / Community, NFT/Gaming/Metaverse, and Infrastructure) and could also compete for sponsor bounties ([big list here](https://app.buidlbox.io/ethdenver/ethdenver-2023)).\n\nProjects had to be submitted by 8 AM, then from 10-2 teams showed off what they made. On the regular presentation stages, teams went up to the stage corresponding to their track and gave a 1:30 pitch and demo, with a little time for questions. When they weren't on stage, they were downstairs in the main buidl room where the sponsor bounty judges and random attendees could learn about what they made. Track judges picked the top three of each track to present on the main stage during the closing ceremony at 3 PM, then five final winners were chosen.\n\nMiscellaneous notes: I don't think I can see an overall list of hackathon projects, but each one does have their own page if you know what URL to go to. But for most I don't know the URL so it's going to be hard to link to them. I also heard that there was a major hiccup where in the midst of planning out judging, a bunch of teams just got missed entirely and weren't scheduled for a pitch slot or a table location. The team worked to resolve it, but with everything happening so fast some teams were just screwed over. Hopefully it's better next year. Also I finally checked out the arcade area, good collection of imported Japanese arcade games, nice selection of rhythm games in particular.\n\n* [**Logris Vaults:**](https://app.buidlbox.io/projects/logrisvaults) A good place to start off the list. DoubtStars has been [talking about this project](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jb1i37k/) so I don't really need to. I didn't find the team on the buidl floor, but I can throw it on here anyway because it's cool.\n* **ChainRep:** A project to put security audits and reports (or at least links and a general rating) on-chain. Reviews point to the smart contract in question, and are written by reviewers who are issued certificates by trusted entities like the EF or something. So you could potentially make a DeFi protocol that generally works with any ERC20 token, but checks ChainRep and only allows tokens with positive reviews from certified reviewers.\n* **MintUI:** A library of React components for web3 that share information between one another to make web3 programming easier. Main example (as the name would imply) is NFT minting.\n* **Composooor:** Would appreciate more insight into this. The team was saying something about how it's hard to build composable dapps/protocols using other protocols that rely on off-chain data. So this is a MetaMask snap (bounty hunting ho!) that simplifies this composability and significantly reduces the amount of code you need to create a clean integration.\n* **Dual Rollup:** Cartesi is an [existing platform](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/overview/) I'm only just learning about for developing optimistic rollups whose execution environment is literally a [Linux VM on RISC-V](https://docs.cartesi.io/machine/intro/). This project uses that to run a ZK *prover* on Cartesi, or ultimately a ZK rollup on an optimistic rollup. I get the concept but I feel like I'm barely able to grasp the implications. The team suggested you may be able to implement a universal (or at least cross-EVM) ZK bridge.\n* **Alice's Ring:** A project for proof of solvency. With it, tenant Alice can prove to landlord Bob that she has enough assets to cover rent, notably *without revealing the actual address to Bob*. Then, if Alice later uses [zkBob](https://www.zkbob.com/) to actually pay her rent, Bob may never actually have to see Alice's actual assets. The team says that the proof must be computed over multiple blocks or something in order to prevent someone from proving solvency after taking a flash loan. But nothing is stopping Alice from generating the proof then immediately selling, transferring, or gambling it away.\n* **Artist Hunger Games:** A pretty wild project in which artists get paid to participate in a hunger-games style game. A DAO of NFT holders have the ability to vote on which artists get removed from the game each round, and can also do silly votes on things like telling the artists where to live or eat. Make it a reality show kind of thing. I was reminded of [Mark](https://www.ted.com/talks/mike_merrill_how_i_became_the_world_s_first_publicly_traded_person) [Merrill](https://www.wired.com/2013/03/ipo-man/), who famously sold off shares of himself.\n* **CryptoTaco:** A point-of-sale tool for merchants to accept crypto for payments without having to worry about keys or wallets or whatever. Uses [Magic's](https://magic.link/) tools to onboard merchants using their email addresses. These guys had a lot of enthusiasm, but I'm not sure they're fully aware of how busy this space is. Hasn't bitpay been doing this since 2013 or something?\n* **QuestGPT:** Basically [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home) implemented as a Discord chatbot, using DALL-E to create images related to the story which are then minted as NFTs. Pretty nice user experience in the end. Not quite the same degree of control as AI Dungeon gives you though. I was told they use multiple AIs (all GPT?) working together to keep track of context/worldstate and regularize the story.\n* **Factorial:** Modular libraries/tools for building DeFi protocols, one example being a \"liquidation module\" for any time you may need to do something analogous to liquidating a user's position.\n\nThe following are the finalists who presented at the closing ceremony. These were short talks and it was easy to miss critical details, so this may be quick.\n\n* **Sesame (Winner!):** Allows you to use Ethereum on your phone without internet by sending data over SMS. Has a little wallet interface that can update ETH market price and portfolio value, and lets you send simple transactions.\n* **FundPG (Winner!):** A no-loss donation pool that allows users to specify some percentage of their yield to go to public goods.\n* **Krypto Kredit:** Some sort of credit score platform using [Huma](https://huma.finance/). Kind of missed the details.\n* **Bitcoin Vitalik's Vision:** Fork of the OP stack to post data on Bitcoin, inspired by ordinals of course. Team answered a question about their experience by saying \"it sucks to build on Bitcoin\".\n* **Swappy (Winner!):** Token swaps using natural language queries. You type in \"Swap 5 USDC on Ethereum for MATIC on Polygon\" and it parses it with GPT, prompts you if you're missing anything, constructs the actual details of the swap, lets you visualize and confirm it, then executes.\n* **Rhinestone:** My notes on this literally say \"something something account abstraction\" sorry.\n* **Slang:** Lets you write a single command to generate code to integrate with Ceramic (decentralized data storage) as if it were a web2 database.\n* **Inheritable:** Web3 wills for inheritance. Puts inheritances in a Merkle tree for verifying claims. Lets you establish a group of Witnesses who attest/vote that you're dead to start the inheritance process.\n* **BaZaarK (Winner!):** I believe this was about selling an NFT but using ZP proofs to do so without revealing all of its traits. May find some specialized use cases.\n* **MyMule:** Virtual pet game with a 3D environment where the pets are NFTs. If you interact with it regularly and keep it happy, it prints some ERC20 tokens for you. If you let its happiness bar go to zero then it dies.\n* **Synesthesia:** Collecting music NFTs isn't as fun as JPEG NFTs because of the difference in medium. This project creates generative art for each piece of music based on its metadata to make catchy pictures to go along with them.\n* **ZKpoEx (Winner!):** This provides a way for auditors to create a ZK proof that an exploit (generally agnostic to the type of exploit) exists, without revealing the specific details of how it works. Good way to do responsible disclosure. Probably my favorite out of the finalists.\n* **Tribe.Credit:** P2P lending protocol. You can deposit some capital, then it connects to your phone's contact list and you can say how much you'd be willing to lend that person. If they borrow from you, you don't get to see who exactly it is or how much. If they don't repay you then identity gets revealed and they get kicked out.\n* **GasPay (listed as Gasly elsewhere):** Simple token swap tool that just adds the ability to pay for gas in whatever token you want.\n* **Denoted:** A medium/hackmd/notion kind of writing site that integrates with all sorts of crypto data and analytics tools to create graphs and visualizations embedded in the posts. Generated dynamically so can update over time.\n* **M3mber:** I think this is a way to mint an NFT that represents a membership in something with an expiry date (pitched as a way for DAOs to bring in recurring money like a subscription rather than just the one-off token sale). They use ENS domains, with [NameWrapper](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper) to accomplish this; is it only because ENS domains already have expiry built in so they don't have to code it from scratch?\n* **GovBlocks:** DAO management platform. Modular design, has useful things you would expect like DAO members being able to start a vote to change a governance parameter.\n\nThat was actually the last day. Some people are sticking around for the mountain retreat, but that's not really something to report on. I'll assemble a final review tomorrow and that'll be it!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver Day 10</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jazo2by/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The final day of ETHDenver!
