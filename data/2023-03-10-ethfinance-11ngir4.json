Billionaires don't put themselves into situations where their net worth would go into the negative due to a completely foreseeable tax burden.\n\nAlternatively: This is already a problem with taxing realized capital gains, so taxing unrealized gains doesn't make it worse.

I think taxes should be 1) as local as possible, 2) as visible as possible 3) as simple as possible, 4) should not require more than 5 minutes to compute, and 5) as low as possible, and 6) require no personal information on you or your plans.</p>\n\n<p>The only one I know of that fits this is a land tax.  NOT a property tax, but the value of the land, not what is on it.  It is not the government&#39;s business if I want to add a room to my house, or if I get a better job, or if the value of my stock holdings go up.</p>\n\n<p>A land tax could be computed automatically, billed monthly, with most of it going to local government, some to states, and enough to the feds to pay for national defense and legals systems (probably 2-5%).  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>attribute most of my success to luck - many of my friends started out on a very similar path in life as me, and our results couldn&#39;t be any more different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Get a wider array of friends.  Yes, some people hit the jackpot (such as buying ETH early), but no, luck is a small part of success.  Go to rural America, people who have lived in the same small town for 40 years, and spend a day with them.  You&#39;ll see how little luck has to do with anything.\n(I&#39;m talking about the vast majorities, not the 0.1% that has exceptionally good or bad luck).  Most people end up exactly where they deserve.  Not in a straight line, but eventually.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m still waiting for California to not be both one of the highest tax rates in the world yet also the world&#39;s fifth highest grossing jurisdiction as compared to countries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is happening, right now.  It has a high tax incomes because 1) it has a lot of land mass, 2) once upon a time it was welcoming to new industries, 3) the weather and scenery is the best in the country, and 4) it takes time to kill that.  CA has had net outflows of population for decades, with no end in sight.  It is no longer viable, and is likely going bankrupt within the next 20 years.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-11 05:04:18","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-03-11 05:19:22","id":"jbstcxd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_11ngir4","parent_id":"t1_jbrzguu","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/hblask","body":"> The normal person paid 38% tax on their purchase, and the billionaire paid 8% tax on their purchase.
