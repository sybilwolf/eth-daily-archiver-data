I'll probably be back buying ETH at $10K to fund trip insurance or pay for my electric car charging or whatever.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For the first time since 2017 I don&#39;t have any ETH. It hurt to sell but in my opinion there are just too many headwinds for the risk/reward to be worth it at this time.</p>\n\n<p>I think that Ethereum&#39;s vision requires stablecoins. In our crypto circle we&#39;re happy to use ETH as a basis for DeFi or speculating on NFTs, but for real world use cases like tokenized bonds or concert ticket NFTs the general public will need things denominated in fiat. I think the depegging of arguably the safest dollar backed coin (USDC) and the safest decentralized coin (DAI) is no small thing. Add all the recent lender and exchange failures, that Coinbase turned off the sell button, potential runs on exchanges, and the possible contagion and regulatory response and the $1400s seems like a good price to me.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a shame because all of the failures and scams tainting this space have nothing to do with Ethereum itself or its community, but I also don&#39;t see how the broader public can get past that.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the great community and best of luck to y&#39;all.
