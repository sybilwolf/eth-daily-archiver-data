I think L2 is extremely important to Ethereum's success and bridges like HOP are a foundational piece to that ecosystem.

I think it's a good chance to benefit the sub (and HOP) by getting info out on the project that otherwise may not be super well known.

I also do use it as my L2 bridge when I need to use it... it really is a good product! It will appear as just bought in my wallet, but I didn't really have a choice as I wanted to not link it to my cold storage wallets. I sold the HOP to USDC, transferred it over through Coinbase as a mixer, and bought it back with that USDC (plus some extra). \n\nI also plan on participating in the delegate incentive program. In short, HOP is paid to delegates who reach a certain threshold of HOP delegated AND participate in votes / governance discussions. As noted in my post, this is *a* reason, but NOT *the* reason. I do not believe I will qualify for it at this point as I am joining little late for this period, but it is right in the middle of a 6 month trail period that may or may not be renewed. \n\nThat's really it, other than a final heartfelt message that the support from those in this community who have shown it has been really and truly appreciated!
