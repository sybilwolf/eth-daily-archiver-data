The first thing you'd need is a good automated (AI?) way to detect duplicates and illegal content. If a duplicate is found, you'd compare which NFT was minted earlier, and keep that one. There should also be a rating system, that allows users to rate each submission - then when trainers select which images they want to use, they can select images that fall above a specified rating. Then only those NFTs would get paid. This would incentivize submissions to be high quality. You'd also want to put together a committee of unbiased humans (a DAO?) to serve as a \"supreme court\" in terms of moderating content and ensuring fraud and other, unsavory, content is kept to a minimum.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Just watched this video about AI art, and it triggered the thought of creating a blockchain based art repository.
