In both scenarios you lose value, and the current track makes it look like it&#39;s almost certainly one or the other, and the only question now is how much are we going to lose, and how can we best avoid this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I disagree with the premise of what you think I think but to try to get to the essence of your point, yes any economy with a 2% inflation target is going to devalue its currency over time.  Whether that, combined with fractional banking and currency not pegged to gold, will lead to a total collapse of civilization as we know it is still far afield in my mind.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-26 15:34:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jdstwze","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_122blya","parent_id":"t1_jdsrvoa","score":-1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/VECHAIN_10_DOLLARS","body":"I don't think bitcoiners are as stupid or misguided as this sub makes it sound like they are","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I don&#39;t think bitcoiners are as stupid or misguided as this sub makes it sound like they are</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-26 11:23:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jdrurq4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_122blya","parent_id":"t1_jdr1n4w","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/maninthecryptosuit","body":"A cursory glance at CryptoTwitter bitcoin maxi accounts would suggest otherwise.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A cursory glance at CryptoTwitter bitcoin maxi accounts would suggest otherwise.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-26 12:40:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jds5qvi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_122blya","parent_id":"t1_jdrurq4","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/VECHAIN_10_DOLLARS","body":"Those are just the loudest and stupidest voices.

The government has done this to another industry in recent memory when the Obama administration tried to bypass Congress and defund the firearms industry through similar means (If anyone has read about this attack on crypto being called Choke Point 2.0, that was Choke Point 1.0). This is the same exact thing. How anyone could view these actions as a series of coincidental one offs is beyond me. I mean, I dont even think theyre hiding it. On to your individual points...\n\n1. The idea that a Wells Notice is no big deal, defending yourself against the govt in court is no big deal and its just how things work is complete nonsense. A Wells Notice is a BFD. Defending your company in court costs millions of dollars and severely hamstrings your business. Doing it to Coinbase, a public company who just passed muster with the SEC in 2021 when they went public is an outrageous abuse of power by unelected bureaucrats and meant to send a message to other,smaller companies who dont have their resources. Coinbase has literally said over and over that Genslers \"come in and talk to us\" is complete BS, they've asked multiple times what they need to do to be \"in compliance\" and the SEC wont answer them. Just because CB will probably win in court doesn't make it no biggie.\n\n2. The assault on crypto banks is the most obvious part of Chokepoint 2.0. In January the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC put out a joint statement warning banks who dealt with crypto companies and then did it again in late February ( about alleged liquidity risks...oh the irony). Again people like you may dismiss that as simple warnings, no biggie. But banks arent stupid. When the three biggest regulatory agencies all tell you \"I'm not saying you shouldn't do X, but we consider it very, very risky\" it doesn't take a decoder ring to decipher that message: It might be technically legal but we don't want you doing it. Multiple banks report having those conversations directly with regulators. Signature Bank was solvent and NY State just shut it down. And Barney Frank, the sponsor of legislation which led to major bank reform after the 2008 crash, was on the board and said clearly it because of their involvement in crypto. Again, how anyone can just handwave this away or see it as a one off rather than part of a coordinated effort is mind boggling.\n\n3. Again, with the dismissiveness. The White House didnt just call crypto risky. They spent 35 pages of the Economic Report of the President, a pretty major document,  knocking the balls off crypto, essentially all but calling it a scam...right as they're about to launch their own stablecoin and as the traditional banking system comes under major stress. At the same time #1 and #2 are happening. Bruh, come on. Do I have to draw you a map?\n\nThe war against crypto is real.

Just because CB will probably win in court doesn&#39;t make it no biggie.</p></li>\n<li><p>The assault on crypto banks is the most obvious part of Chokepoint 2.0. In January the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC put out a joint statement warning banks who dealt with crypto companies and then did it again in late February ( about alleged liquidity risks...oh the irony). Again people like you may dismiss that as simple warnings, no biggie. But banks arent stupid. When the three biggest regulatory agencies all tell you &quot;I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t do X, but we consider it very, very risky&quot; it doesn&#39;t take a decoder ring to decipher that message: It might be technically legal but we don&#39;t want you doing it. Multiple banks report having those conversations directly with regulators. Signature Bank was solvent and NY State just shut it down. And Barney Frank, the sponsor of legislation which led to major bank reform after the 2008 crash, was on the board and said clearly it because of their involvement in crypto. Again, how anyone can just handwave this away or see it as a one off rather than part of a coordinated effort is mind boggling.</p></li>\n<li><p>Again, with the dismissiveness. The White House didnt just call crypto risky. They spent 35 pages of the Economic Report of the President, a pretty major document,  knocking the balls off crypto, essentially all but calling it a scam...right as they&#39;re about to launch their own stablecoin and as the traditional banking system comes under major stress. At the same time #1 and #2 are happening. Bruh, come on. Do I have to draw you a map?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The war against crypto is real. Those calling it hyperbole should be ignored.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-26

I am sure there will be some legal/regulatory skirmishes eventually on the latter front but Blackrock shouldn&#39;t be underestimated... they are an 800 lbs gorilla and everyone knows it.  </p>\n\n<p>There may be more sinister plots afoot but it wouldn&#39;t be a whole of industry approach.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-27 14:31:06","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-03-27 14:41:57","id":"jdxadtu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_122blya","parent_id":"t1_jdtewp0","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-26 14:55:33","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jdsosyz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_122blya","parent_id":"t1_jdsg3qh","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Koratickle","body":"Its about staking as a service, some of their listings, and coinbase wallet.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Its about staking as a service, some of their listings, and coinbase wallet.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-26 23:00:52","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jdu7xtv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_122blya","parent_id":"t1_jdsosyz","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Have another upvote.
