Even worse is that ***there is a clause to specifically make the Freedom of Information Act not apply to this new law***.

Signature requests in Metamask look like <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/assets/img/712.ced7bf03.png\">this</a> with a &quot;Sign&quot; button at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>Transaction requests say &quot;Contract interaction&quot; and prompt you with a gas price to choose and the button at the bottom says &quot;Confirm&quot;, not &quot;Sign&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The latter will sign a transaction that will be sent to the mempool, the former will just provide the signed message to the dapp.</p>\n\n<p>You are right to say you are signing something in both cases and with the same private key. But signature requests are different, they use another API and prepend a string to the message to be signed. That prevents attackers from having you sign a transaction that could be sent to the mempool, because the signed message won&#39;t correspond to that transaction. It will correspond to &quot;\\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\\n&quot; + the raw transaction which is not a valid signed transaction that can be included by validators.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-30 10:14:35","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-03-30 10:23:13","id":"jeaoj89","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_126c8nf","parent_id":"t1_jealood","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/newtosh","body":">\tSignature requests in Metamask look like this with a \u201cSign\u201d button at the bottom.\n\nBut how do the EIP-2612 USDC spending limit signature prompts look like that you were warning us about?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Signature requests in Metamask look like this with a \u201cSign\u201d button at the bottom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But how do the EIP-2612 USDC spending limit signature prompts look like that you were warning us about?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-30 11:46:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jeb2yzy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_126c8nf","parent_id":"t1_jeaoj89","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Like [this](https://imgur.io/a/2kYUFy4)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Like <a href=\"https://imgur.io/a/2kYUFy4\">this</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-30 13:04:55","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-03-30 13:21:51","id":"jebfb6l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_126c8nf","parent_id":"t1_jeb2yzy","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/newtosh","body":"Uhhhh that looks like Ort of a scam I'd fall for!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Uhhhh that looks like Ort of a scam I&#39;d fall for!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-30 15:12:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jebyyow","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_126c8nf","parent_id":"t1_jebfb6l","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/mistrustless","body":"Yes","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-30 09:16:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jeafeht","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_126c8nf","parent_id":"t1_jeadlnb","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"How can you find the nonce without seeing the tx?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How can you find the nonce without seeing the tx?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-30 09:20:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jeag0ps","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_126c8nf","parent_id":"t1_jeafeht","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Burbank309","body":"The nonce is always sequential, so it's usually the last nonce + 1\n\nEdit: if you signed a TX with a higher nonce but don't know which, it's not possible to find out.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The nonce is always sequential, so it&#39;s usually the last nonce + 1</p>\n\n<p>Edit: if you signed a TX with a higher nonce but don&#39;t know which, it&#39;s not possible to find out.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-30 09:56:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jealqu5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_126c8nf","parent_id":"t1_jeag0ps","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"So I can look at my last known tx and just +1 to that and it should be the same as the unknown one","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So I can look at my last known tx and just +1 to that and it should be the same as the unknown one</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-03-30 10:41:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jeasp5f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_126c8nf","parent_id":"t1_jealqu5","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Burbank309","body":"Unless the unknown transaction has a different nonce.
