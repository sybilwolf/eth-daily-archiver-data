As Alex from zkSync stated: ZK allows for infinite scalability. This means, regardless of the tx and user count, on any given L2 the ZK proof stays as small as ever. Usage demand becomes decoupled from blockspace demand. I am not sure about optimistic rollups thou, as fraud proof might be somewhat related to tx count, but I am not sure if it is a significant amount.\n\nThe demand that L2s are going to induce is for Data Availability (DA) space. The cost of it is expected to be peanuts (compared to other tx costs). Full dank-sharding will provide orders of magnitude more space for L2s than the L1 ever could. This is possible because the storage is not going to be permanent (it doesn't have to be) and not all nodes will have to store it. Therefore, researchers don't expect any space shortage (or bidding war for it) in foreseeable future. \n\n**Looking from this perspective, the 10% burn you've mentioned, could completely disappear right after L2s would implement changes to use DA instead of call-data.** \n\nLooking at the bigger picture: the more financial activity in the ecosystem, the more high value transaction appear.
