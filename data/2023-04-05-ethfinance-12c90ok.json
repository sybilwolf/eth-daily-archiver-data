PAIN.</p>\n\n<p>Seems like the specifications are getting more and more complex - and getting harder to implement as a result. I fully understand the logic : Everything is done so that&#39;s it&#39;s only soft forks, but I feel like we are reaching the limit of what is reasonable - I was unable to finish my work because taproot requires huge number manipulation at some stage of the computation, which cannot be done easily on GPU/FPGA/Asics - i.e. I have to code a specific bignumber library to support taproot. I will do it, but it&#39;s yet another hurdle I have to overcome as a developer, and the math and code are complex enough as it is.</p>\n\n<p>Then came the time for me to transfer ordinals - I won&#39;t judge too much here because I know it&#39;s very recent and the tooling is not fully there yet. But let me tell you that waiting for ~12 min to transfer an NFT (this is not going to change, block times !) and being able to transfer only one per block (which might change in the future, I hope !) is by far the worst user experiece I ever had in crypto.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry, rant over :)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-04 23:55:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jf0tue3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12c90ok","parent_id":"t3_12c90ok","score":59,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/dabadger0","body":"Compare to the Ethereum ecosystem and especially EVM compatibility.

The attack was carried out by a *validator* and stole value from *searchers* via an exploit in *relays*. As a result:\n\n* *Validators* have to be constrained in their ability to receive execution payloads (the contents of a block--the tx's), in order to limit their attack potential. This could mean node operators have a stricter protocol for working with mev-boost, one that has less wiggle room for latency and higher consequences in case of issues.\n* *Searchers* need to take extra precautions to protect their funds from similar attacks. The best practices here are still uncertain, but there may end up being a higher barrier to entry for new searches to enter the space safely, and some MEV profits may be reduced due to the need to be more careful with capital.\n* *Relays* need to harden themselves to prevent a variety of anticipated attacks of this variety.

Note that the main API call in question, commonly referred to as getPayload, is when a proposer returns a signed block header to the relay and receives the full execution payload in response.\n\n**getPayload Return Delay**\n\nRelays, upon receiving getPayload, will publish the block to the beacon network as before, but will now wait one second before returning the payload to the proposer. This extra second means that the relay has a larger responsibility to make sure the block gets published and propagated in a timely manner, and must build their infrastructure accordingly.\n\nIf the relay fails to do so, then the proposer cannot help distribute the block for an extra second, increasing the chance of a missed slot. And if relays are now responsible for distributing all their blocks, this increases the importance for others to peer with their nodes to get fast access to new blocks, and makes a DOS attack on the relay much more impactful.\n\n**getPayload Sent Too Late**\n\nIf a relay receives a getPayload call later into a slot (currently most relays have this cutoff at 3s), the relay will immediately reject it, and will not reveal the payload. At this point, the proposer has already signed a block and now just gave it to a third party (the relay). If they were to locally build another block, sign it, and publish it, now they have to trust that the relay will keep the original signed block private. If that is ever revealed, or if the relay is malicious, the proposer could end up slashed!\n\nSo instead of taking that risk, a proposer's CL client will instead refuse to sign another block. This means accepting that the slot will be missed, but at least prevents slashing. This change is asking the more heavily debated at the moment.\n\n----\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThat's a very long way to answer your initial question.

I&#39;m not of a strong opinion either way but I do have a question about your thinking.  In that scenario, when sold, do the &quot;rewards&quot; get taxed as income whenever they are sold?  I think that&#39;s the case.  So, from a tax perspective, a person would just keep track of their rewards over time and if/when they sell they&#39;d report that sale as pure income?</p>\n\n<p>On one hand, your method allows the staker to retain all their rewards and use them to generate more staking rewards (if they choose).  Otoh, paying income taxes in the year they are &quot;controllable&quot; allows for a cost basis and future capital gains treatment.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure which is correct.
