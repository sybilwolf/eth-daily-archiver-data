The originators of LUSD and RAI did not create ETH, obviously, to do this. ETH was created separately previously and is unrelated to LUSD and RAI.</p>\n\n<p>This wording is targeting stablecoins like UST and USDD, both of which relied on coins created <em>by the originators of UST and USDD</em>, which are Luna($LUNA) and Tron ($TRX).</p>\n\n<p>The confusing part, I think, is determining the role of Maker($MKR) in keeping DAI stable. In my mind, DAI (and the Maker ecosystem) is at a risk here because regulators may look at MKR and feel that it plays a role in keeping DAI pegged (which it kind of does, but in a way with extra steps).</p>\n\n<p>My other question, and another part I disagree on with the linked Twitter user, is saying that this bill outright bans stablecoins with reserves other than US-dollar equivalents. If you go to Page 11, part 4 it says stablecoin regulators <em>shall consider</em> the following factors. That to me does not sound like an outright declaration of &quot;it has to be backed by US coins, currency, treasury bills, etc. But IANAL and might be reading that wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I&#39;m not sure how I feel about this. My gut is telling me that USDC will be fine, and may even become a de facto CBDC.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-16 02:41:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jggprhx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_12nw0o0","parent_id":"t1_jggd4ej","score":50,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Keep in mind that lawmakers shoot for the moon with their legislation sometimes, because they know the final draft will get watered down.\n\nPersonally I\u2019m kind of annoyed that this draft is posted on social media yet I have no idea *who* wrote this and have no perspective on how likely it is to pass.\n\nAnyone know the authors/sponsors?
