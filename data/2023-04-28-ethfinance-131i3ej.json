He asks a clever question but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/vF6C3Zjb0vk?feature=share&amp;t=3974\">is lied to by the Blockchain Capital guy</a> about custody. BC guy claims that custodians need &quot;incredible technical expertise&quot;(I&#39;m sure like the companies they invested in) and that more than one person can not have custody of a digital asset at the same time. After thinking it through really well too. That&#39;s pretty brazen. </p>\n\n<p>It makes sense of course, they&#39;re the kind of people that would go an lobby. But in the end that will also mean there will be crypto industry regulation, not crypto regulation. The same as it happened in other markets prior. Over time this will empower those crypto companies and take control out of the hands of the users. Just like <a href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-companies-urged-governor-to-ban-cannabis-home-cultivation-document-shows/\">marijuana companies lobbied for legislation banning home growing</a>, crypto custodians, digital banks and the like will be eager to limit self-custody - for public safety and user protection reasons of course. <em>wink wink</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-28 13:22:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ji3lb3k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_131i3ej","parent_id":"t1_ji3ey95","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Tom_The_Moose","body":"Dude that Sherman guy seems to be just barely holding on to these new fangled ideas.

It can directly affect the security of base Ethereum when a significant portion of the restaked funds is concentrated in a small number of projects.</p>\n\n<p>A counter argument could be that such a development is inevitable one way or another and that LSTs can also be gambled away in other ways. </p>\n\n<p>For another solution of the problem Eigenlayer is trying to tackle, Polkadot has &quot;parachain auctions&quot;. It&#39;s an interesting concept to look at imo. Something like it could be implemented in Ethereum with an EIP, in addition to staking. Imo it&#39;s better to have sound solutions natively integrated in the base layer, the same goes for liquid staking too btw, which is already a mess. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/12zeavv/lido_is_at_3222_avoid_lido_which_includes_these/\">Lido is close to 33% rn</a>.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-28 07:09:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ji20r30","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_131i3ej","parent_id":"t1_ji1ejy6","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/WILL_DANCE_FOR_COINS","body":"https://www.beaconcha.in/pools  \n\nWhy does it show Lido owning about 23% instead of 32% on rated.network?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.beaconcha.in/pools\">https://www.beaconcha.in/pools</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Why does it show Lido owning about 23% instead of 32% on rated.network?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-04-28 06:55:02","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ji1ypxe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_131i3ej","parent_id":"t3_131i3ej","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/superphiz","body":"There's a shitty thing about Reddit that well-sourced comments are often quickly banned by the automoderator.

Trustless. Resilient. Secure. Cause of fully distributed network of validators. Entrance as low as 1E.\n* Liquid staking. You would stake to get divETH, which operates kinda like stETH. You can wrap into wdivETH which operates like rETH/wstETH. This can be tax advantageous depending on your preference of incoming vs capital gains.\n* You would have an option to run a node for extra rewards (split 50% between stakers and node runners in the final Phase 2 version on the mainnet). There's some minimum hardware requirements. \n* It's currently on the testnet. Should be live on mainnet in Q2\n\nThe key points is that I've learned is that combines liquid staking with DVT. Since it uses a smart contract to pool funds it can be as low as 1E. Honestly, I'm waiting for a bit more info after their testnet releases to see how it pricesly protects against penalties and bad actors and why 1E would be safe.
