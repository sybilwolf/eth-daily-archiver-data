Open to discussion as I love all your feedback! Also, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but it seems as if the arguments we see are USA-centric in this discussion. <a href=\"/u/Cryptomoon2020\">u/Cryptomoon2020</a> is focused on this specific regulatory squeeze and subsequent risk. Correct? </p>\n\n<p>So that we&#39;re on the same page: I imagine that it&#39;s fair to say that you can agree that RPL is used to stake ETH and shares a similar onboarding process to the goal of staking 32Eth.  So, I have a difficult time seeing how one way of staking would be at a greater risk than the other to any degree of harm (to just one method vs the other). They are interconnected in this process at least. In the purview of liquid staking: LDO, SWELL, SWISE, etc would inherit the same risks, but I never see the same complaints about regulatory risk applied to them from that corner.   So where should we tremble with anxiety and gripping fear:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Location/US Jurisdiction?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>\u2022 ETH: Not US. Ubiquitous </p>\n\n<p>\u2022 RPL: Not US. Australia, but easily moved anywhere</p>\n\n<p><strong>Standard for securities gauge in US. Is asset used to raise capital in public/private markets w/promise of profit from issuer?)</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u2022 ETH: Decentralized, passes Howey Test</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 RPL: Decentralized, passes Howey Test. Creates ability to stake 8 and 16 Eth instead of 32. If anything, this increases decentralization of both assets. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Post-worst-case scenario. US hates crypto. Eth and RPL = securities. Risk of censorship?</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u2022 ETH: Minimal.  We all use VPNs, global devs unite, US FOMO in at later date</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 RPL: Minimal. VPNs, global devs unite, US FOMO</p>\n\n<p>So where is the risk greater for just RPL under this specific fear?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-05-14 08:32:49","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-05-14 14:04:29","id":"jk4koi6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_13h32x6","parent_id":"t3_13h32x6","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Meyamu","body":">Standard for securities gauge in US.

Where I disagree with them is how they refuse to be explicit on the rules.\n\nLet's break staking into two parts. \n1) actually staking, \n2) staking as a service (eth chain only).\n\nI think 1) regular staking is probably non complaint with US laws, and the same for many countries. My view is that it comes under the facilitation of financial and other transactions. If we use a basic thought experiment to consider sanctions; assuming 1% of crypto transactions (for arguments sake) are from sanctioned countries, I would say that there is a legal problem there if your validator is including them in blocks. This is akin to the sanctioned block builders censoring some things already. So, just on the sanction issue alone, I think the legality of staking is a mess. \n\nMy cautious view is that staking does involve breaking laws, but the complexity and lack of clear cut rules broken laws makes it hard to regulate. For example, I could use my validator to only include my pictures of frogs into blocks, no law broken there. \n\nWe will likely see some attempts at regulation against stakers, but there are much lower hanging fruit that the regulators will be too busy with other things.\n\n2) staking as a service is just one step beyond this. If you take people's money and you kyc / aml them and have appropriate licenses to take and manage other peoples money, then no extra issues. \n\nIn my view, Kraken was targeted under the premises of low fruit. Kraken is a soft target with money to pay out fines, and they caved in. Was Kraken miss selling investments to the public, perhaps, perhaps not. I wasn't miss sold, but perhaps regular Joe public was, and they didn't understand the complexities of crypto staking.\n\nMy view of rocketpool and other mini pool operations is they lack kyc / aml and are therefore clearly in breach of regulations. People running mini pools here seem blind to the risks of what they are doing, and are hostile to the thought that they could be breaking the law. It really surprises me the level of mental gymnastics where people won't even admit there might be a problem.\n\n3) you won't see 3 above, but I decided to add it here :-)\nThe fundamental difference between defi, ie a smart contract running a service and a mini pool is who / what is doing the work.\n\nFor pure defi, the smart contract takes something in, and spits something out. No humans are involved (ignoring the stakers). The contract runs itself globally, in no particular country, and the network does the work. The smart contract can and often will not comply with laws and regulations, but there is no single person/ org to go after. I suppose the US could forbid stakers from processing smart contracts that don't comply, but that would be very complex to manage, and I don't think the regulators want to do this kind of work.\n\nRegulators might go after defi front ends. I would say that is their most likely point to attack.\n\nWhen looking at mini pools, there are clearly people running these mini pools. Someone / some org is doing work with other people's money. Give me a list of all ip address running minipools and send the police around their houses. You can talk about VPNs to evade this, but that won't work forever, and a large threat of penalty would surely scare off most operators anyway. Operators can move to other countries with less regulation, and they probably will.\n\n\n.....\n\nNow, to what I think is right vs. wrong.\nI am all in favour of staking, open finance, and distributed staking with mini pools, etc. I think the rules based system imposed by governments are designed to keep the rich rich, and protect the banks from competition.
