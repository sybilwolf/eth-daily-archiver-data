I dont really see how theres gonna be broad market ATH when sec is litigating the whole industry, ftx, celsius, etc are liquidating their assets, sam bankman & others are hauled off to cells all with constant negative media attention","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Imo crypto as a whole is unlikely to see new ATH unless the central bank taps get turned on again. Not just every crypto but every rando company mooned in 2020-21. stonks like zoom were making news every other day. Now all of them have taken a big beating, including crypto. Such conditions are unlikely to return in a hurry. </p>\n\n<p>AI is indeed more interesting to invest for funds, but retail ability to gain exposure to AI is very limited and unlikely to change much. So the speculative retail is going to have to make it in crypto. Since retail has to make bread in crypto, its unlikely funding dries up completely in crypto </p>\n\n<p>Within crypto there could be pockets that outperform based on market conditions (meme coins etc), coins that do well over time (infra plays) - identifying these can be what sets apart a good investor from those buying sacks of alt l1 and hoping for alt szn moon porn</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, crypto is at the start of the peak of disillusionment phase and the problem is worsened by regulatory clampdown, so unless  there are dapps that have legit demand from non crypto users, its gonna be for this industry to leave the ghosts of the last year behind. The next couple of years are all gonna be focussed on lol suits, bankruptcy and criminal trials.

Killing of Tweetbot and Twitterrific could have resulted in people accepting that and switching to official clients \u2014 but there was a lot of resolve, and in general Apple community is way, way more active on Mastodon now. There are great clients (Ivory), more activity and generally, long term independence due to federation. Many people run their own instances.</p>\n\n<p>Initially there were waves to push crypto twitter to mastodon as well, particularly Phil Daian&#39;s cryptodon push. But it never caught on. Crypto twitter is still crypto twitter.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Reddit. Both <a href=\"/r/Apple\">r/Apple</a> and <a href=\"/r/iPhone\">r/iPhone</a> have announced that they will remain private indefinitely. I&#39;m still looking to see how it resolves long-term, but I&#39;m hopeful the community migrates somewhere better, ActivityPub-based. We might even get resurrected Apollo.</p>\n\n<p>This sub and <a href=\"/r/CryptoCurrency\">r/CryptoCurrency</a> are back already. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad \u2014 but it&#39;s not the decentralized ethos I was hoping for.</p>\n\n<p>My feeling is that crypto community is a mix of ideological cypherpunks, but also speculators, memers, etc. Cypherpunks pushing to more decentralized options is not enough, if the price of that is losing &quot;normies&quot;. Somehow Apple community didn&#39;t fall for that so much.</p>\n\n<p>Curious if anyone has more thoughts on this.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: one more dynamic that works in Apple&#39;s favor: it has stronger organizing forces outside of Twitter itself. Podcasts, blogs, etc. Once people behind these shifted to Mastodon, community followed. Crypto doesn&#39;t have as many &quot;outside-the-system&quot; influencers.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-06-14 02:25:24","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-06-14 02:28:41","id":"jo31m7d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_148yyad","parent_id":"t3_148yyad","score":33,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"I fully agree and feel exactly the same way.
