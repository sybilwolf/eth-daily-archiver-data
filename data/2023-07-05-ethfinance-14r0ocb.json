Since I have a 30 minute commute twice a day, that I use to listen to podcasts, I suggested some episodes and thought this might be a good regular post (is it a good idea?). So here are my 3 favorite podcast episodes of the past two weeks or so. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bankless:** [**Restaking Alignment with Vitalik, Sreeram, Tim Beiko, Justin Drake, Dankrad & Jessy**](https://www.bankless.com/restaking-alignment-with-vitalik-sreeram-tim-beiko-justin-drake-dankrad-jessy)\n\nThis bankless episode is special. First of all, neither Ryan nor David play a central role, instead Tim Beiko moderates the discussion. Further the topic, restaking and eigenlayer, is interesting. I guess this episode is rather hard to follow if you have no idea what eigenlayer or restaking is, because in some parts the discussion is rather technical and goes into details. \n\nBut if you have spend some time understanding restaking, this episode is pretty cool. I was expecting some more controversy to be honest, but still it is a good hour with interesting arguments. It also features some other interesting things and developments (e.g. PBS, and something called \"one shot signatures\" that Justin presented, and tbh, I have no idea how they really are connected to this). If this doesn't convince you, you might want to listen to it, cause \"Jessy\" apparently is a 13 year old and at least I was thinking about way different stuff when I was 13 (though I think they didn't really add a lot of value to the episode). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Epicenter:** [**Starknet - zk-STARKS and Cairo 1.0 upgrade**](https://epicenter.tv/episodes/502)\n\nEpicenter is one of the oldest blockchain related podcasts and I just found it again by coincidence. The episode with Eli Ben-Sasson (Founder von Starknet and as I learned, apparently also zcash) is very interesting, because it gives a pretty good summary about where starkware/net comes from, where starknet is now and also where it is heading. \n\nThe episode is fairly technical from time to time, talking about differences between SNARKs and STARKs, so very zk and developer focussed, but still pretty interesting if you have a little knowledge about how all of this works. I also think there is \"alpha\" \"hidden\" in this episode, cause part of the discussion is around decentralization. Eli Ben-Sasson basically says that starknet will decentralize the sequencer within the next 12 months and then \"something will be at stake\". Now we already know that there is a STRK token and so if they want to decentralize the sequencers with \"something at stake\" that can only work with a setup similar to PoS and he actually mentions tendermint as a consensus mechanism I think. \n\nOne very interesting and rather controversial part of the discussion is about decentralization/ social consensus and how starknet makes sure right now that it can't be exploited/ lose customer funds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Unchained:** [**ERC-6551: Is this the next big leap in NFT innovation?**](https://unchainedcrypto.com/erc-6551-is-this-the-next-big-leap-in-nft-innovation/)\n\nListened to this episode this morning on my way to work. Usually I am not a huge fan of Unchained interviews that are not regulatory focussed, because I think that's Laura Shin's biggest strength, but this one is good, because the topic is cool. \n\nThe ERC-6551 token standard was new to me. It's basically a standard that connects NFTs with a smart contract wallet, which leads to NFTs being able to holding assets like other NFTs, but also ERC-20s, etc. This is cool, because it apparently allows dynamic NFTs that are completely onchain (and not caused by a centralized change of the metadata). \n\nOne tricky but probably cool feature is, that since the NFT owns the smart contract wallet, it also allows you to transfer and hence potentially sell SBT aka soulbound tokens. If you have them in an EOA, that's obviously not possible, but if the SBT is in a smart contract wallet that is controlled by an NFT, you can sell the NFT and the corresponding SBT moves with it. I had heard about having SBTs connected to e.g. your ENS domain - now I understand how that's supposed to work technically. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonorary mention: Bankless episode with Raoul Pal. Great hopium. But in the end, it's just another macro podcast and I don't think RP knows better, where all of this is headed than others. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI might be back at the end of July if I find some time on the beach (yes, Benido will be off to the beach! Finally some vacation), but only if you guys think this is interesting, so let me know!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>+++ Benido&#39;s favorite podcasts episodes +++</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some days (weeks?) ago, someone here asked for podcast recommendations and interesting episodes.

But I want to hear you guys take on what has kept me up most of the night.\n I have been listening to a lot of Lex Fridman on top of Bankless lately and something is slowly becoming clear to me and I am sure too many of you also. Tell me if there is any reason this is not possible to do today if the right conditions exist</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You have an average to good coder in solidity </li>\n<li>You have someone who knows how to prompt/interface well with an AI agent (chatgpt)</li>\n<li>Understands Defi protocols and strategies well </li>\n<li>Understands how the Ethereum network functions ie gas fees and how to use the network</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Are there any obstructions to someone who meets these conditions from setting up a bot with an address and having it go out and earn money autonomously using the Ethereum network? If the answer is no, I think none of us own enough Ethereum?</p>\n\n<p>Would love to hear this sub thoughts on this?\nThanks</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-05 01:18:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jqqer6x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_14r0ocb","parent_id":"t3_14r0ocb","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Nayge","body":"I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to say.
