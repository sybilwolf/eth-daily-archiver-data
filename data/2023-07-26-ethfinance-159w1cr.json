I triggered someone into a FlatEarther-like trance by merely suggesting the most rational explanation to this whole shtick is bread and games distracting us from real problems.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s perplexing just how many Americans truly believe, on a core level, they&#39;re the center of the world. Alien civilization travels from outer space to Earth? <em>Of course</em> most of them would show up in the relatively small patch of land where &lt;10% of world pop lives. Of course the US government would be the only government of the world to even be aware of The Truth, because american exceptionalism guarantees american tech of the 1950s outpaces that of any other place in the world in 2000 or 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe those world governments, who couldn&#39;t coordinate covid response 2 years ago, were somehow able to muster a joint effort spanning thousands of people over generations to hide everything. Alongside the Cold War and all. Dunno why we&#39;re even doing this blockchain thing, turns out perfect cooperation between independent actors is an easy problem to solve!</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, I feel recent world events have done a number of some psyches. The need to believe in something different  becomes pathological at times. It&#39;s frustrating because we have no shortage of other issues to solve - even if they aren&#39;t as sexy.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-26 20:26:41","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"jtm8nmw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_159w1cr","parent_id":"t1_jtm1dlk","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Glittering-Duty-4069","body":"Comment Removed By Author\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Comment Removed By Author</p>\n\n<p><em>This post was mass deleted and anonymized with <a href=\"https://redact.dev\">Redact</a></em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-07-26 09:35:17","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-01-11 08:29:13","id":"jtjj91b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_159w1cr","parent_id":"t1_jtjattj","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/epic_trader","body":"Watched the entire thing and I cannot understand the people who say this was a disappointment.\n\nThe congress is *clearly* aware that the UFO phenomenon is real, of the understanding that is non-human, and taking it very seriously.
