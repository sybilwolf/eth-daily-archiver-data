It basically came down to the fact that there is no mnemonic because it's directly generating it from your hardware wallet's existing mnemonic. In that ethstaker post I linked the OP didn't have a mnemonic because he used the allnodes tool, but [he was still able to update his withdrawal address afterwards (which required a mnemonic)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/10vrwcw/comment/jhcl56o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nWhen you generate your validator keys using the deposit-cli (or wagyu key gen) it gives you the option to create a completely new mnemonic, or use an existing one (so you could technically use your hardware wallet's 24 word mnemonic too). However the allnodes tool simply bypasses the need for a mnemonic (so Allnodes does not get your mnemonic either) cause it's generated directly from the wallet address, if that makes any sense.\n\nIn the end the only thing that really matters is the withdrawal address is set properly. **The mnemonic that people generate at the beginning doesn't really serve a purpose anymore**. It was basically only needed for OG stakers that\n\n1. weren't able to set a withdrawal address at the time staking first launched, and needed their mnemonic to manually update after it became available (which is why they emphasized so much not to lose the mnemonic at the time, otherwise the funds would be lost forever). But as you can see above even that OG staker who used the Allnodes tool was able to update without the \"mnemonic\", by using their hardware wallet's mnemonic.\n2. If you lost your signing keys and needed to regenerate them. But you can actually just regenerate them by connecting your hardware wallet to the allnodes tool. Or you can just keep backup copies stored safely.\n\nMy thoughts are if you're already trusting Allnodes' staking service (to not act maliciously/get compromised and slash their users), then there's no real reason to not use their key generator tool.\n\nEdit: Are you going to stake with Allnodes or are you solo staking with Dappnode?
