Gold allows all of the above, and that's why it forms such a big part of the balance sheet of Central Banks. But it does so at a significant expense, it's expensive to move and settle transactions with, it's expensive to self-custody. It has another problem, its future issuance schedule is unknown. The possibility of mining asteroids is close to our reach on a civilization scale. Central Banks, that should be thinking long-term about these risks, should start considering seriously how to decouple themselves form gold.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum also meet the criteria above. They present significant advantages towards the costs of settlement and self-custody. The issuance schedule is predictable and  is set programmatically. So I will simply lay down the case for why Bitcoin is an unfit choice for this purpose and Ethereum does not suffer the same problems.\n\n1. Bitcoin's energy consumption scales linearly with its market cap. Energy is the most fundamental commodity, our entire economy consists of taking free energy and using it to produce derived products we consume and improve our life with. If the most fundamental form of money you use competes significantly with the rest of the economy in its use of energy, this removes significant growth potential from the economy. If you have an alternative form of money that meets the same criteria but consumes less energy, then it will be superior, in fact, it will be guaranteed to win over the long-term because its adopters will grow at a faster rate as they will be unburdened from the high energy costs. Ethereum's energy consumption does not scale with its market cap, it's O(1) with respect to market cap, so perfect for assuming this role.\n\n2. Bitcoin's disinflationary issuance schedule will cause security issues for the network in the long-term. Either there won't be an economic incentive to mine the network and therefore the network will be too easy to attack given the economic value it represents. Or the blockchain will become unstable, with frequent reorgs and increasingly centralized (defeating the credibly neutral value). Ethereum does not have this issue because it took the necessary steps to fix it (long-tail issuance and EIP-1559).\n\n3. Bitcoin the network can only settle Bitcoin transactions. This creates a very significant limitation. the Bitcoin network enjoys the properties of credible neutrality, permissionless, self-custody, and global settlement but any other thing you may need to settle (bonds, stocks, real world asset ownership, other financial products...) do not. As they cannot be expressed over the network. Any other financial product that is built on top of this reserve asset won't have these properties and needs to be settled over a network that won't be credibly neutral, permissionless, self-custodial, etc... So the entire financial world will have to be built over brittler foundations. Ethereum allows for expressing general purpose logic on top, you can build a financial system that enjoys those same properties on top of it.\n\n4. Bitcoin cannot scale to satisfy the global settlement needs. This is again related to the lack of expressivity of the Bitcoin network. Lacking general purpose programmability, the scaling techniques that you can apply are very limited, and very quickly devolve into centralized solutions built on top that do not enjoy the credible neutrality, permissionless, self-custody.... Ethereum, precisely because it allows general purpose logic to be implemented, can be made to scale while inheriting those properties on top. This is what the roll-up centric roadmap is doing at its core, use advance cryptographic techniques to compress proofs of computation. But this is possible in the first place because the Ethereum network is a general purpose computer.\n\nIt's going to take time, but ETH will become the global reserve asset for the very simple reason that it's the only asset that meets all the conditions necessary to beat the incumbent.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some thoughts expressed synthetically for the ultimate bullcase; the adoption of ETH as the ultimate reserve currency.</p>\n\n<p>At a supranational level (i.e. above government structures created/enforced by States) you need a form of money that is credibly neutral, permissionless, self-custodial, and enables global settlement.
