There are roughly two types of LST roadmaps out there: you have horizontal scaling through the addition of new modules and you have vertical scaling through the use of new protocols built on top of the existing one. You can make a weak analogy to modular vs monolithic chains but it doesn\u2019t hold as both of the aforementioned routes are types of modularization as I will explain below. \n\nLet\u2019s start with vertical scaling. The framework to use here is the L2 scaling pathway that Ethereum itself is taking. Ethereum limits data throughput with the economically enforced gas limit and scales this with rollups that abstract and reduce economic burdens for end users while maintains all the security of the base chain. \n\nThis same model is what Rocket Pool is pursuing currently. The base layer is scaling as quickly as it can safely while a layer 2 ecosystem continues to build. Node Set is the premier example of this. Node Set is designing a protocol designed to work on top of the Rocket Pool contracts to enable vast scaling through economic efficiency. It is a semi permissioned but trustless network of rocket pool node operators who are able to take on additional minipool demand without having to post additional collateral. Outside users will have 2 new LSTs available to them. The first is xrETH. Since these L2 node operators function without capital requirements, the fee they need to take for compensation can be much lower. As such, xrETH can yield full solo staker yield while offering an incentive to node operators that opt in. Additionally, xRPL will be an option. This token let\u2019s anyone deposit RPL to the Node Set network and receive an LST for that RPL. There currently is no liquid wrapper for RPL and so this will be a game changer. Since there is little opportunity to earn yield for RPL, the xRPL token only needs to pass back a portion of RPL yield to be attractive. Some of you may recognize this broad concept from an essay I wrote years ago asking for someone to build a \u201clido fork on top of rocket pool.\u201d Shout out to Node Set for making an even better reality. \n\nA major benefit of this L2 approach is that Node Set can more easily experiment with design than the main rocket pool contracts can. You don\u2019t have to risk upgrading the base layer and can actually move towards ossification. Economic abstraction also means that node set can build systems for people who only want to stake ETH, only want to stake RPL, or both. \n\nL2s enable modularity by virtue of the huge design space. DVT networks can be built on top of rocket pool using ssv and obol tech. \n\nThough I don\u2019t encourage this next type of L2, it is worth mentioning. There are centralized versions of roughly what Node Set does. All nodes is the premiere example where you give them Eth and rpl and they will sorta handle the rest. This model doesn\u2019t add to Ethereum\u2019s network security. It\u2019s a model other groups are trying to break into which is healthy. One day Coinbase might be the leader of this model. \n\nThe major drawback to this method is that is doesn\u2019t have hard set ways distribute stake. If the centralized L2s start to gain in dominance, the value of the Rocket Pool network will diminish. However, we roughly track all nodes and it currently is far from a threat. Ultimately, the ability to gatekeep at all is a centralizing vector that shouldn\u2019t exist in an unbiased base layer serving Ethereum. As such, it\u2019s ultimately going to be up to the social layer to keep Rocket Pool decentralized. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the other type of scaling - horizontal. The premier example of this is Lido who is roughly taking an approach reminiscent of the OG Ethereum sharding roadmap that thought the L1 could do it all. Sharding was the plan to split the network into many individual but connected shards. Each share would have had its own execution environment and bridging would have been a challenge. The route lido has taken is similar in trying to get the one lido network to encapsulate everything. They will maintain the existing, massive permissioned node set and add new modules that, in theory , will include permissionless staking with bonds, DVT networks, and more. Lido has designed a bridge between its internal shards with the staking router. When new stake comes in, it will programmatically distribute that ETH depending on module availability and set targets. In practice, this means the ETH in permissioned nodes will grow while the other modules slowly scale up. \n\nThe general problem with this approach is that it is taking a centralized product and making it less centralized very slowly over time. It\u2019s not clear how they will be able to attach enough node operators to take on stake in a safe manner. It\u2019s riskier to move from a trusted permissioned network to a permisionless one than the other way around. Consider for example if one of the new modules was vulnerable to a Sybil bug that went unnoticed. Secretly, an evil actor was pretending to be a bunch of nodes when in fact they were only one. There is now economic incentive to do this as stake gets distributed. I\u2019d like to point out that the nethermind research they funded found as of yet no effective Sybil resistant mechanism to incorporate with DVT. \n\nFurther, it will be up to governance directly to control the flow of ETH. They can vote to take out modules, change weights, and more. Adding in governance to the system is the wrong move, it turns LDO into a defacto Ethereum governance token. Ungovernance is the safest approach for the network. \n\nI only discussed rocket pool and lido here but virtually all protocols are following one of the above routes, and since most started centralized, most are following the lido route. I\u2019m very interested to see what route Diva chooses as it is DVT from the ground up, it could make sense to become a plug in network. \n\nIn summation, rocket pool and lido are following different roadmaps that analogize very well to the old and modern Ethereum scaling roadmaps. These routes each have their pros and their cons and are likely shaped by how these protocols had their origins. Lido was centralized and growth maxi from the get go. Rocket Pool was restrained and prioritized decentralization over faster launch times. One of these is following daddy Ethereum. The other sits at 33% of the network.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Let\u2019s talk about the future of LSTs.

It\u2019s riskier to move from a trusted permissioned network to a permisionless one than the other way around. Consider for example if one of the new modules was vulnerable to a Sybil bug that went unnoticed. Secretly, an evil actor was pretending to be a bunch of nodes when in fact they were only one. There is now economic incentive to do this as stake gets distributed. I\u2019d like to point out that the nethermind research they funded found as of yet no effective Sybil resistant mechanism to incorporate with DVT. </p>\n\n<p>Further, it will be up to governance directly to control the flow of ETH. They can vote to take out modules, change weights, and more. Adding in governance to the system is the wrong move, it turns LDO into a defacto Ethereum governance token. Ungovernance is the safest approach for the network. </p>\n\n<p>I only discussed rocket pool and lido here but virtually all protocols are following one of the above routes, and since most started centralized, most are following the lido route. I\u2019m very interested to see what route Diva chooses as it is DVT from the ground up, it could make sense to become a plug in network. </p>\n\n<p>In summation, rocket pool and lido are following different roadmaps that analogize very well to the old and modern Ethereum scaling roadmaps. These routes each have their pros and their cons and are likely shaped by how these protocols had their origins. Lido was centralized and growth maxi from the get go. Rocket Pool was restrained and prioritized decentralization over faster launch times. One of these is following daddy Ethereum. The other sits at 33% of the network.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-08-20 08:43:03","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-08-20 08:52:43","id":"jx0c6hw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_15w1z93","parent_id":"t3_15w1z93","score":42,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"Always one of my favorite topics.
