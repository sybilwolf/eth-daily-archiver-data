People in the future will value it tremendously even though we are still trying to figure it out today, and a lot of the stuff doesn&#39;t work or looks kinda scammy. </p>\n\n<p>My only thought for you would be that maybe you are too overinvested if you feel the crushing weight of this bear. I have regrets for not taking profits at the top, but also I&#39;m still very confident we will at least reach those prices again soon, and likely 10K, 25K, and possibly further within this decade. All I can do is keep my regular buying and live within my means so I can hold everything until the next time my brother in-law is texting about how to buy ETH or maybe FriendTech keys. I feel bad because you are young and you have these expectations that are crushing you, take prices out of the equation mentally if you can, treat it more like a retirement account than a get-rich quick account. That means you have to sock it away and forget about it until the time is right, it&#39;s very difficult.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-09-18 10:48:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k15m86v","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_16lmall","parent_id":"t1_k15i4gc","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":">treat it more like a retirement account than a get-rich quick account\n\nI appreciate this perspective.

I tried to push for Layer 2, but there at least on the surface seem like some valid reasons for their own blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>Heres the intro pitch from them...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;HYTOPIA is a collaborative and independent video game built by various members of a community who have been at the forefront of Minecraft&#39;s modding and third-party games ecosystem for the past decade.</p>\n\n<p>With the goal of addressing the limitations and gaps in creative expression within the Minecraft ecosystem and modernizing player experiences, HYTOPIA is a game and developer platform built from the ground up and takes inspiration from well-loved game mechanics that players have become familiar with. HYTOPIA&#39;s goal is to become &quot;the next Minecraft&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission is to encourage innovation and collaboration among a community of enthusiastic players, driven content creators, and helpful contributors in order to enable enchanting and boundless gaming experiences we have always desired from Minecraft, but Minecraft&#39;s lack of capabilities has prevented.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So essentially they have literally built their own backwards compatible version minecraft from scratch. Their plan is to vampire attack all the Devs and players from minecraft that have been dissillusioned by Microsofts bad management of the EULA and alientation of creators.</p>\n\n<p>Its seriosuly impressive, and they are fully aware of how &#39;on the nose&#39; NFT&#39;s are to the gaming community, so its completely free to play and the blockchain is completletly hidden from Players unless they want to check it out.  Worth checking out IMO.</p>\n\n<p>Beta pre-registrations are available now.  If you use the link below, you get an extra lootbox and so do I.
