Blocknative's Matt Cutler basically explained the reasons for this in this [Empire podcast episode](https://blockworks.co/podcast/empire/4ee75432-5c0b-11ee-9ac4-d31bf67ceb24). It comes down to \"relays don't make money, but cost money\" (and Blocknative is a company with investors that expect returns - and relays have negative returns). \n\nSo what are relays and why are they important? Relays are important for PBS aka proposer builder separation, MEV capturing and specifically for MEV-boost. MEV is every everywhere. Users make transactions and generate MEV opportunities. These transactions are analyzed by searchers, who insert (e.g. add before or after the tx) their own transactions and forward them to builders. Builders collect all tx (from searchers, but also the public mempool) and build blocks with the highest value. Builders then basically forward the blocks to validators (via MEV-boost, a solution outside of the protocol) including the ETH denominated reward they are willing to pay if there block is chosen/ proposed. This is where relays come into play. They relay the blocks and make sure the validator gets paid and the network can't be attacked. As basically always in Ethereum, decentralization is key, so we need multiple relays. PBS doesn't work without relays, but there are no revenues, no revenue share, no nothing for relay devs/ operators. Searchers, builders and validators make money, relays are basically the only infra in the MEV supply chain that we expect to work without getting paid. \n\nThere are some theories why a small fee wouldn't work (builders would only use free relays, hence relays with a rev-cut would be excluded most of the time etc.). So in my opinion (retroactive) public goods funding (PGF) is the best way to get it done. \n\nHere's where this sub comes in! I would like to\n\n\\- use this communities knowledge to identify potential sources for PGF\n\n\\- see if we as a community can influence how funding/ grants are distributed (e.g. if governance tokens we all own can vote for an application)\n\n\\- use our voices to spread the word about the importance of relays and why funding is essential \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example there is [Optimism's RPGF](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf). If Ethereum doesn't work, OP as an ETH L2 doesn't work. In my opinion it's a nobrainer that u/austonst and u/kudeta (who run the aestus relay) should receive OP funding, but we all know that's not how it works. But if our OP delegates (u/liberosist, u/_weboftrust, u/minimalgravitas, u/pseudotheos and more) coordinated, I am sure their voices can make a change. \n\nI have no idea how the EVM treasury is doing, but maybe we as EVMs can come together and think about ways to support relays in general and the aestus relay specifically. \n\nu/kudeta: You said yesterday that applying for all these grants and funding was complex and a lot of effort.
