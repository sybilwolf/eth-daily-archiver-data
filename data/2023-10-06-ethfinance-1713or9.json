At least for me that has always worked :)\n\nLet me try to give you some very short answers, \n\nLido ist a staking pool with a liquid token. What does it mean and why does it exist? Ethereum started switching to Proof of Stake more or less 3 years ago. In Ethereum one validator needs some hardware, some software (\"clients\", one for execution, one for consensus) and a deposit of 32 ETH. Validating = securing the network is not very easy (but it's also not very hard if you put in some effort) so a lot people wanted to stake their ETH to gain rewards for securing the network without thinking about all the technical details. That's where Lido comes in. You just deposit your ETH into a smart contract and Lido makes sure your ETH is staked with one of their staking partners. In return you even receive stETH and can use it in defi (e.g. as collateral to mint stable coins etc.)\n\nAll real money transactions happen on mainnet. But if you want to test stuff before allowing people to interact with real money, you do that testing on a testnet. So testnets have their own token, which usually doesn't/ shouldn't have any monetary value and can be optained via faucets (= places where you can request a certain amount of the native testnet token so you can play around). There are several ETH testnets (e.g. Sepolia). The testnets have their own chainID and can be added to your wallet (e.g. Metamask) easily. Some are used to test ETH itself, meaning they are a preparation for new forks (updates) for Ethereum the network. But they can obviously also be used for protocols built on top of Ethereum to test with users, but without real money. \n\nL2s are layer 2s, also called execution layers from time to time. Ethereum decided to scale the network outside of L1 = layer 1 = mainnet and to focus on \"rollup centric roadmap\". Layer 2s are secured by mainnet. All transactions that happen on the different L2s are \"documented\" on L1. So your assets should technically be as safe as on L1, L2 are not in a technical position to run away with them, scam you etc. There are several Layer 2s: there are optimistic rollups like Optimism or Arbitrum and there are zero knowledge rollups like zksync or starknet. These layer 2s plan to increase \"tps\" = transactions per second way beyond mainnets tps (around 10-12 I think) and down the road the goal is to have 10k or even 100k via a lot of different Layer 2s.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think the easiest way is just to ask your questions here and I am sure people will answer.
