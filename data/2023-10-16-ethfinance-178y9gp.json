The topic was heavily discussed, delegates coordinated and a lot of great posts have been made. u/minimalgravitas made this post last week and I would like to add some thoughts with regards to \u201cThe Future\u201d since I completely agree that we need to coordinate even more than ever before.\n\n**Some assumptions before I start outlining my thoughts**\n\n* This community has a lot of smart and thoughtful people\n* This community cares about ETH\u2019s values and has developed a strong sense of community and belonging over years\n* We have existing infrastructure to coordinate, which is a strong foundation (happens to be reddit right now, but could be something off reddit as well)\n* This community owns sizeable stacks of governance token (mostly airdropped, some bought on the open market)\\*\n* We shouldn\u2019t focus on lido, but be agnostic to be able to respond to all threats Ethereum is and will be facing in the future\n\nSo how can we coordinate more/ better to become a governance powerhouse? I think we need to be structured and prepared beforehand. I also think that for now (let\u2019s call it \u201cphase one\u201d) we should also limit ourselves to the current community. Still this will be a huge change and will probably need people dedicating a good amount of time to make things happen.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis/ Identification:**\n\nThis step needs to be done both internally and externally. These steps should happen regularly to be prepared for e.g. an airdrop, possibly every 3 to 6 months (tbd), but potentially also ad-hoc.Internally: We need to understand our members strengths, interests and availability. Some questions I would ask to identify potential delegates: Who is capable of representing ETH Finance as a delegate? Is the member focussed on a certain topic/ category? Is the member a delegate already? Is the member free and willing to work as a delegate? I think people should both be able to suggest other members, but also apply as a delegate.Externally: We need to understand which protocols / categories of protocols are critical to ETHs health, both direct and indirect. Direct in this case means e.g. relevant for ETH\u2019s security and / or decentralization. Indirect could mean because of a large treasury and its economic power.So let me give you an example:I think the EigenLayer airdrop will happen at one point in time in the future. Let\u2019s assume the token is a governance token. A lot of smart people see Restaking as a potential threat to Ethereum's security. Hence I think we should try to make sure there is (at least!) one community delegate for EigenLayer.We should identify capable and willing members now to make sure once the airdrop happens we can act fast. Personal opinion to make it even more concrete: I would suggest u/hanniabu for EigenLayer delegate because I believe restaking is critical and believe that they have proven themself in the past couple of weeks both on reddit, but also on twitter.Best case we can identify up to 3 delegates per critical protocol so that we can act fast. Down the road we would basically have a table that serves as an overview of potential delegates per category.\n\nExample:\n\n* L2s: Member X, Member Y\n* Defi: Member Z\n* (Re)Staking: Member A, Member B\n* NFTs: Member C\n* Infrastructure: Member D, Member E\n\n**Step 2: Coordination and delegation**\n\nThis step will usually be helpful after a token launch/ airdrop. It basically formalizes step 1.After a token launch announcement we try to understand our \u201cpower\u201d, so try to get a feeling for our power by estimating our token allocation (this will be fun, cause it will be so hard to estimate lurkers and their allocations). Based on this we agree on a number of delegates.After that we ask the potential candidates if they are still interested and confirm 1-x \u201cofficial\u201d delegates. The process? To be defined! Most likely via reddit, maybe an extra post? The daily?Important: obviously everyone is still free to run as a delegate even if they are not the \u201cofficial\u201d community delegate. Also everyone is still free to delegate to a completely different delegate. We can\u2019t tell people to not run as a delegate and we can\u2019t force people to delegate to the community\u2019s candidate.From my point of view the goal of this step is to delegate as many tokens as possible to the \u201cofficial\u201d candidate to make sure our representatives have power. I think it\u2019s better to have 3 candidates with 1M tokens each than to have 30 candidates with 100k tokens (or even less because people choose external candidates).But why would you do that? This is where step 3 comes in:\n\n**Step 3: Collecting feedback**\n\nI think we have a big advantage over other delegates: We can crowdsource feedback. Or in other words your delegates will usually understand your position (because you post it or upvote those comments that summarize your position in the best way possible) and will best case act based on the feedback.So what should the process look like? I think there are two possible ways.Delegate driven: The delegate will usually be aware of important topics, discussions and votes. They could either publish their position on a certain topic in the daily or they could ask for feedback if they have no idea/ position yet. I think this is the best scenario, but this might not work all the time. Delegates might not see a certain vote as critical as the community, might not have enough time to check all discussions proactively etc.Community driven: So the community members could tag the delegate to express their view on a certain issue. I think this has already worked pretty well the past couple of weeks and is already part of the community DNA.Based on the feedback the delegate forms their opinion and votes. Important: The delegate is of course (?) free to make the decision they think is best. The community feedback is a suggestion on how to vote, but not binding. If people are unhappy with the delegate they are free to redelegate (see step 5).\n\n**Step 4: Reporting**\n\nI think it would be beautiful if there was some kind of \u201creporting\u201d back to the community. This could be a summary of the votes of the past, feedback the delegate got in the process (cause the delegate will likely be in touch with other delegates), information about other delegates that have a similar stance as we are and generally things the delegate thinks are important.The goal would be to learn what delegates have learned and allow for some \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d for interested members. This reporting could be a written report, but maybe some delegates would also be open to join the weekly EVM meeting in Discord.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluation and (re)delegation**\n\nThe last step is evaluating the delegate\u2019s actions and potentially redelegation. In a best case scenario the evaluation just results in\u2026 nothing. People are happy, feel that the delegate did a great job and represented this community well. But we obviously have to accept that this won\u2019t be true all the time. Redelegation could happen if a member goes inactive, votes/acts against the community's values/ interest, etc.To be honest I don\u2019t know how often this should be done, maybe once a year and whenever there are big decisions? In the end this is what some members have been documenting the past couple of days with external delegates and changes in reputation.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Let\u2019s make ETH Finance a governance powerhouse</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the light of the lido threat and their ARB request this community has shown a brilliant reaction.

Please feel free to help me with this by adding more information or correcting me.\n\nFirst up, TIA apparently has a few key uses on the network:\n\n* Just as gas on Ethereum is paid by Ether, TIA is used fore paying for data storage/availability on Celestia's Blobspace. Devs and users pay TIA fees to keep their data accessible across the network.\n* TIA is also used on L2s, which allows devs to launch new rollups without needing to make a new token. TIA acts like gas and a currency to bootstrap rollups on Celestia.\n* TIA fees and rewards are given to validators staking on the network to secure and decentralize Celestia's L1. Celestia uses PoS so TIA holders can stake and validate.\n* Celestia plans to implement a fee burn mechanism for its TIA token.
