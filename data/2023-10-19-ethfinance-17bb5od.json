One step was basically abandon zksync\u00a0lite and move all funds to mainnet and/ or era. Since I had not withdrawn from lite until now, I had no idea how long it would take, so I checked other blocks on zkscan for some minutes.\n\n[Example 1: zksync\u00a0lite, block 372467](https://zkscan.io/explorer/blocks/372467)\u00a0(this is not the block with my withdrawal :))\n\nIf you check the transactions, it seems to me like 80%, maybe even 90% are airdrop farming/ spam. Swap 0.02 USD for 0.00012 ETH. Fee: 0.04 USD. Most swaps are <20USD swaps. There is a total of 6 transactions with a value >0.1 ETH. 4 of those are deposits of very similar size (0.7502, 0.7722 ETH, 0.7802 ETH and 0.8002 ETH).\u00a0\n\nThis lead me to generally analyzing L2 activity, here's what I found after just 30 minutes:  \n[Example 2: zksync\u00a0era, batch 276661](https://explorer.zksync.io/batch/276661)\n\nIf we look at the \"value\" column, we will see a similar picture: a lot of very low or lowish transactions that don't make a lot of sense. Swapping 0.01 USD for ETH, wrapping 2 USD of ETH etc. A lot of 0 USD value transactions that I can't really decode. Just a very few tx that seem \"real\" and legit.\u00a0  \nSo I checked ArbiScan to see if Arbitrum was different. Since Arbitrum already had its airdrop and its unlikely (though not impossible) there is a second one, I would expect the picture to be different.\u00a0\n\n[Example 3: Arbitrum, batch 375402](https://arbiscan.io/txs?batch=375402&isnitro=true)\n\nThere seem to be more \"valid\" transactions with a higher value. Interestingly even on Arbitrum there are still a lot of transfers that don't make a lot of sense to me, but that might either be airdrop farming for the protocol used (and it just happens to be on Arbitrum) or it's activity to make a wallet look more \"real\" / \"human\" for Scroll, zksync etc.\u00a0\n\n  \n[The last Optimism batch (3234)](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/txs?statebatch=3234&isbedrock=true)\u00a0doesn't look much better either, but there's a fourth airdrop coming, so that was to be expected.\u00a0\n\n  \nCan someone help me out and try to understand better what all these 0 USD value transactions are?

This account is new (funded 13 days ago, made 6 transactions today, all could be portrayed as testing), so there is no pattern here, but it still looks strange.\n\nEdit: If we look at L1, this address is empty. Like literally funded, used bridge, that's it. I understand that some people value privacy/ anonymity and hence use new addresses regularly. This could be the case here as well... but overall it just smells fishy.

First of all thank you for the positive feedback both with comments and upvotes! I have been thinking some more about it and even though there wasn't a real pushback, I would like to update it and cut it down to three steps.\n\n1. Coordinate\n2. Delegate\n3. Communicate\n\nAfter reading my own post a couple of times, I asked myself. \"How would you respond to this if this was posted by someone else?\" My gut feeling: It's a good idea, but it's too complex. We need to start with an MVP for governance and coordination. Hence, here's a short \"Minimum viable coordination\" (MVC) update:  \n\n**1) Coordinate**\n\nOnce an airdrop is announced, we try to coordinate as fast as possible. \n\nWe collect potential delegates from this community. Members can both announce their motivation to be a delegate for the protocol and members can suggest other members.  \n\nWe publish a list of  \"aligned\" delegates that are close to this community, but not daily active. \n\nWe try to focus on a few delegates to make sure \"our\" delegates have a lot of tokens delegated and hence governance power. \n\nObviously everyone is still free to become a delegate, but if we can achieve to agree on e.g. 2-3 \"official\" candidates that focus on one protocol, this would have a lot of benefits. My suggestion is also to that the \"official\" delegates should be delegates for one protocol only. My best educated guess is that the time needed for \"good\"/\"professional\" governance will be up only and in the future being a delegate for 2+ protocols will be very hard. \n\n**2) Delegate**\n\nWell, this part is easy. We delegate our tokens to our \"official\" delegates. \n\nWhy is it an extra step? Just to emphasize that it's coordination first and delegation second. Or in other words: I think it would be very beneficial if we all be patient. Don't claim on day one since most of the time the delegation is part of the claiming process. Let's try to make sure we really had some time to agree on candidates. \n\n**3) Communicate**\n\nThis is happening already, but we should do this as much as possible. Tag your delegates if you have question/ feedback. Or as a delegate: Talk to the community, ask for feedback if you are a delegate. \n\nThe delegates are our ears and eyes for that protocol. E.g. I would have missed the LDO proposal, but I am very happy it was discussed here. We need this kind of activity to inform the community, align and coordinate even better than before. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this MVC is way better than the first one. Yeah, reporting sounds cool, but it might be overblown (and corporate?). And yes, preparation for a potential airdrop sure makes sense, but could also be a lot of work for something that never happens. Let's try to coordinate ad-hoc when there is a need. If that works out, we can always improve and add more steps. \n\nAirdrops are usually a big news and my guess would be that members that are mostly reading here will come to ETHFinance on these days. By definition I will not know what most of those lurkers will think of my suggest or do when we need to coordinate, but allow me to state this: You are the majority of this community and you all - as a group of lurkers - probably have more governance tokens than the active / posting members.
