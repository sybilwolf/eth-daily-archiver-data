I can't decide between doing that and just selling all the rpl off.\n\nAt the moment there is... almost no demand for rpl. What worries me is that a lot of the node operators who are under that 10% collat limit haven't bought anything to top up. If it continues to fall, they will be even less likely to do so.  There is very little use for RPL in defi, it's inflationary, the odao is still getting paid, once those things are ironed out some time next year, will it be too little too late?\n\nIf rpl demand really keeps staying this low, and the coins value continues to sink, who would want to buy into that to run a node? If I understand it correctly, the main drive next year will be the ability to potentially stake something like 2e, with 3e worth of RPL. The rpl could be lent to the 2e node operator who would get higher rewards on the 2e, and the lender would get rewards on the rpl. However, even right now, with 10m rpl staked, and with the loss of value factored in, the RPL apr is in the negative for a lot of stakers, vs eth. The only people who would really benefit are the few whales who bought massive amounts of RPL early on, not new buyers, and they would be the ones lending out the RPL.\n\nI was also dumbfounded as to why lido had applied for the arb grant, and rocketpool didn't.

But I also think most of us are playing 2 games at the same time. The first is ideological as supporter of ETH and decentralization, wanting to build out this technology in the way it benefits the most people because we believe it will be a force of good.\nThe second is as investor to maximize my returns for me and my family.\n\nThese two are interconnected most of the times but not always. I do believe ETH is the best bet exactly because it is the most decentralized option. I do believe most of the alt L1s will fade into irrelevance at some point. Ideology and profit maximization lead to the same bet here. \n\nThere are also limits to my profit maximization if it hurts my ideology. I wouldn\u2019t buy LDO or stETH even if it does come with higher returns because I believe it hurts my main investment and I don\u2019t want it to be a tragedy of the commons situation.\n\nSo my main bet is ETH, and all other trades are made for the purpose of converting into more ETH. But I\u2019m not going to ignore if I think I can spot an opportunity outside of ETH. As an ex poker player I have no qualms with trading memecoins and alt L1 moneygrabs as a zero sum game, as long as it\u2019s not me doing the scamming with insider information. \n\nSo I spotted an opportunity with SOL and with COIN earlier this year and both happily worked out. But they are not all going to be wins and that\u2019s fine too.\n\nEdit: I also think most just hold ETH because they were burned on other side investments before which is a fair take. Almost all other investments have lost out against ETH in the long run. But I also believe most people aren\u2019t that good at countertrading sentiment. $COIN was talked about here so much when it hit over $100 but barely when it was $45.

But I also think most of us are playing 2 games at the same time. The first is ideological as supporter of ETH and decentralization, wanting to build out this technology in the way it benefits the most people because we believe it will be a force of good.\nThe second is as investor to maximize my returns for me and my family.</p>\n\n<p>These two are interconnected most of the times but not always. I do believe ETH is the best bet exactly because it is the most decentralized option. I do believe most of the alt L1s will fade into irrelevance at some point. Ideology and profit maximization lead to the same bet here. </p>\n\n<p>There are also limits to my profit maximization if it hurts my ideology. I wouldn\u2019t buy LDO or stETH even if it does come with higher returns because I believe it hurts my main investment and I don\u2019t want it to be a tragedy of the commons situation.</p>\n\n<p>So my main bet is ETH, and all other trades are made for the purpose of converting into more ETH. But I\u2019m not going to ignore if I think I can spot an opportunity outside of ETH. As an ex poker player I have no qualms with trading memecoins and alt L1 moneygrabs as a zero sum game, as long as it\u2019s not me doing the scamming with insider information. </p>\n\n<p>So I spotted an opportunity with SOL and with COIN earlier this year and both happily worked out.
