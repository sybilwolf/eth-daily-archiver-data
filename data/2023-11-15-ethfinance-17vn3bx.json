This topic comes up from time to time in my circle who are in a similar position to me in regards to eth. The consensus is that Ethereum is still so new, and will continue to be viewed as \"new\" for a long time, that it's almost impossible to possibly know where the price of ETH will eventually stabilize or settle at. That fact alone remains a variable in the equation, while what is or should be \"enough\" numbers are much more predictable. That conclusion sets up the idea of a \"profit taking plan\" rather than a flat cash out number. \n\nGenerally, I think age and life circumstances very much come into play here. Years ago, back in the ethtrader days, I remember someone saying they hit their cash out number and sold, they had gotten in at ICO prices and the number they hit was enough to pay for their kids collage, pay off their mortgage and retire now. I think the person was in their late 50s. Eth just hit $400. A lot of people were very happy for that guy and a lot of people said he'd regret not keeping some eth around for a higher price. The guy hit his goal and said holding this long was stressful enough. \n\n2. I believe most people here understand that Ethereum right now is the clear front runner for a truly decentralized mass smart contract platform. There really is no other viable competitor right now. Point is, this space is quite fluid. If a consensus shift took place and governance started to go in a direction that didn't align with their values, they would leave. If a true competitor surfaced and that product somehow had answers to Ethereums problems and became the better chain, I believe most would see that and go in that direction. So saying being aligned with Ethereums values blinds people from making investment decisions imo is misleading. I really don't think anyone posting here is blindly investing in Ethereum. \n\n3.

The consensus is that Ethereum is still so new, and will continue to be viewed as &quot;new&quot; for a long time, that it&#39;s almost impossible to possibly know where the price of ETH will eventually stabilize or settle at. That fact alone remains a variable in the equation, while what is or should be &quot;enough&quot; numbers are much more predictable. That conclusion sets up the idea of a &quot;profit taking plan&quot; rather than a flat cash out number. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Generally, I think age and life circumstances very much come into play here.

A lot of good protocol-focused talks on the main stage. In the evening I went to a workshop run by Fenbushi Research on the topics of MEV and PBS. It was a looooong day of sitting around and listening to people talk. The MEV event wasn't over until 11 PM so I figured I'd write up this post in the morning. Ended up taking the better part of the day while multitasking, but oh well.\n\n* Jason Carver and Daniel Ramirez of the EF explained what it would take to run a validator without an EL client. Well, using a *light* EL client. There are three things you need from your EL client, all with light solutions in the works. Block validation can be accomplished with the adoption of Verkle trees. Block *building* can be outsourced via PBS. The ability to do a little bit of (JIT) state access as needed can be provided by the Portal network, which distributes chain data across a P2P network, giving light clients access to state and verifying it. Most stakers should eventually want to move to this model unless they need local block building or fast arbitrary state access.\n* Afri Schoedon, Head of Engineering at ChainSafe, covered the Hole\u0161ky testnet. Hole\u0161ky will have 2.75 billion Hole\u0161ky ETH (heth? hoeth?), compared to goerli's 100 million. Massive difference, part of the goal is to have the testnet \"ahead of mainnet\" in number of validators, to catch issues related to validator set size. Devs are trying to define a more predictable testnet lifecycle, launching alternating PoS/PoA nets every 2 years each with a 4 year lifetime.\n* Michael Sproul, Developer at Sigma Prime, gave an update on Blockprint and client diversity. Very interesting to hear the details about how you can identify CL clients; they've got some nice classification models but the real contribution is the *massive* infrastructure they've built to generate and collect data from all the clients. Minority client classification isn't very good at this point.\n* Mikhail Kalinin, Research Engineer at Consensys, presented EIP-6110 on validator deposit reform. The existing bridge is complex, clients have had a number of bugs in interacting with it over the years, it's slow, and it's hard to look up the full history. The talk didn't spend a lot of time on the solution, but it generally shifts the responsibility of deposit inclusion and verification to the EL. Design and spec are stable, there's a working lighthouse+besu prototype.\n* Parithosh of the EF talked about modern testing design. Generally it's been split up into a lot of parts, easy easily deployable. Bare bones logic moved to Ansible, tooling via helm charts. Dora lightweight block explorer designed for easy support of testnets. Also have Forky to visualize forks and Xatu to analyze the P2P network. Blobs are looking to add 50-100 GB disk usage, 100 kbps network. You can get involved in testing by syncing a node on devnet and sending blobs.\n* Danny Ryan, Researcher at the EF, covered checks and balances in Ethereum. I believe a link to this was posted in the daily. Diversity gud. Can look at incentives as first-order (e.g. if I don't attest right I don't get paid) and second-order (e.g. if Lido breaks the network then they can't use it anymore). Looked at two degenerate cases for staking: 1. almost all ETH is staked and we have system failure; and 2. all staked ETH is controlled by one entity and they can break first-order incentives. (And 3. both happening at once which is bad). How to avoid? Adjust staking rewards to target a total amount of staked ETH, even if that means letting rewards go negative, needs MEV burn. Implement simpler/faster reallocations of stake as long as it doesn't threaten a nothing-at-stake problem.\nStaking Data Panel: Colfax Selby of EthStaker hosted a panel (Michael Sproul, Hildebert Mouli\u00e9, Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter) about staking data collection and analysis. Generally about client identification and associating validators with their operators. It's a hard problem because nobody is forced to identify themselves, there's incentive to hide, and we actually do want some people (solo stakers in particular) to be able to stay anon. Panelists caleld out Coinbase as being particularly opaque and uncooperative.\n* Justin Drake, Researcher at the EF, went over all the mistakes in the design of the beacon chain. There are a lot of them, can't even list them all. MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE=32 is a central issue. Issuance curve is okay but should be better bounded. 16 ETH ejection takes too long, should be faster. Slots aren't aligned with the top of the minute (a terrible tragedy). 12s slots too fast for SSF and ePBS? Sync committees haven't seen adoption and aren't needed long term anyway. BLS signatures are not quantum secure. etc, etc. Ethereum 3.0 wen?\n* Alex Stokes, Researcher at the EF, delivered the State of Our Union Address, aiming at the more philosophical questions. Ethereum is a kind of state-building exercise, and it's worth striving for institutions that support tight-knit communities with a conviction to move towards a destination we expect to make everyone better off. How do we stay aligned? Focus on core values: credible neutrality, permissionless innovation, and concrete optimism. CN + PI means everyone is incentivized to play long-term cooperative for positive-sum. Problems are Lido dominance (where lido governance becomes eth governance) and staking issuance / MEV burn. When choices aren't obvious, use core values to guide decision making.\n\nI am not going to give a summary of every talk at the Fenbushi MEV Workshop because while it's all very interesting I could barely keep up sometimes. Running a relay does *not* make one an expert on searching and building. I'll break things down to the extent that I understand the content well enough to do so.\n\n* We started off with presentations by Yuki Yuminaga of Fenbushi and Alex of the ultrasound relay. Both talked about MEV-Boost relay incentivization. Yuki with a broader overview: validators and builders both benefit from relays but relays make no money :(. Alex with ultrasound's idea of modifying bids to capture the difference in value between one of their winning bids and the second-best relay's bid. Seems nice in that emulates the (established, working) systems for searchers and builders, each bidding against each other and capturing their surplus. Seems concerning in that going full competitive breaks a lot of the cooperative structure relays have built so far, and that the searcher/builder systems are centralizing *hard*.\n* The biggest orderflow talk was Danning Sui of Flashbots, but it was a common topic in general. Danning had good visualizations of flow through searchers, order flow auctions (OFAs), builders, etc. All major players are vertically-integrated market makers, it's just the norm at this point. >50% of DEX non-toxic order flow is already private. Every builder has private order flow, and there is a clear correlation between private flow and block inclusion rate. The theory all says that a small orderflow advantage and a small latency improvement means a *lot* more auction wins.

A lot of good protocol-focused talks on the main stage. In the evening I went to a workshop run by Fenbushi Research on the topics of MEV and PBS. It was a looooong day of sitting around and listening to people talk. The MEV event wasn&#39;t over until 11 PM so I figured I&#39;d write up this post in the morning. Ended up taking the better part of the day while multitasking, but oh well.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jason Carver and Daniel Ramirez of the EF explained what it would take to run a validator without an EL client. Well, using a <em>light</em> EL client. There are three things you need from your EL client, all with light solutions in the works. Block validation can be accomplished with the adoption of Verkle trees. Block <em>building</em> can be outsourced via PBS. The ability to do a little bit of (JIT) state access as needed can be provided by the Portal network, which distributes chain data across a P2P network, giving light clients access to state and verifying it. Most stakers should eventually want to move to this model unless they need local block building or fast arbitrary state access.</li>\n<li>Afri Schoedon, Head of Engineering at ChainSafe, covered the Hole\u0161ky testnet. Hole\u0161ky will have 2.75 billion Hole\u0161ky ETH (heth? hoeth?), compared to goerli&#39;s 100 million. Massive difference, part of the goal is to have the testnet &quot;ahead of mainnet&quot; in number of validators, to catch issues related to validator set size. Devs are trying to define a more predictable testnet lifecycle, launching alternating PoS/PoA nets every 2 years each with a 4 year lifetime.</li>\n<li>Michael Sproul, Developer at Sigma Prime, gave an update on Blockprint and client diversity. Very interesting to hear the details about how you can identify CL clients; they&#39;ve got some nice classification models but the real contribution is the <em>massive</em> infrastructure they&#39;ve built to generate and collect data from all the clients. Minority client classification isn&#39;t very good at this point.</li>\n<li>Mikhail Kalinin, Research Engineer at Consensys, presented EIP-6110 on validator deposit reform. The existing bridge is complex, clients have had a number of bugs in interacting with it over the years, it&#39;s slow, and it&#39;s hard to look up the full history. The talk didn&#39;t spend a lot of time on the solution, but it generally shifts the responsibility of deposit inclusion and verification to the EL. Design and spec are stable, there&#39;s a working lighthouse+besu prototype.</li>\n<li>Parithosh of the EF talked about modern testing design. Generally it&#39;s been split up into a lot of parts, easy easily deployable. Bare bones logic moved to Ansible, tooling via helm charts. Dora lightweight block explorer designed for easy support of testnets. Also have Forky to visualize forks and Xatu to analyze the P2P network. Blobs are looking to add 50-100 GB disk usage, 100 kbps network. You can get involved in testing by syncing a node on devnet and sending blobs.</li>\n<li>Danny Ryan, Researcher at the EF, covered checks and balances in Ethereum. I believe a link to this was posted in the daily. Diversity gud. Can look at incentives as first-order (e.g. if I don&#39;t attest right I don&#39;t get paid) and second-order (e.g. if Lido breaks the network then they can&#39;t use it anymore). Looked at two degenerate cases for staking: 1. almost all ETH is staked and we have system failure; and 2. all staked ETH is controlled by one entity and they can break first-order incentives. (And 3. both happening at once which is bad). How to avoid? Adjust staking rewards to target a total amount of staked ETH, even if that means letting rewards go negative, needs MEV burn. Implement simpler/faster reallocations of stake as long as it doesn&#39;t threaten a nothing-at-stake problem.\nStaking Data Panel: Colfax Selby of EthStaker hosted a panel (Michael Sproul, Hildebert Mouli\u00e9, Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter) about staking data collection and analysis. Generally about client identification and associating validators with their operators. It&#39;s a hard problem because nobody is forced to identify themselves, there&#39;s incentive to hide, and we actually do want some people (solo stakers in particular) to be able to stay anon. Panelists caleld out Coinbase as being particularly opaque and uncooperative.</li>\n<li>Justin Drake, Researcher at the EF, went over all the mistakes in the design of the beacon chain. There are a lot of them, can&#39;t even list them all. MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE=32 is a central issue. Issuance curve is okay but should be better bounded. 16 ETH ejection takes too long, should be faster. Slots aren&#39;t aligned with the top of the minute (a terrible tragedy). 12s slots too fast for SSF and ePBS? Sync committees haven&#39;t seen adoption and aren&#39;t needed long term anyway. BLS signatures are not quantum secure. etc, etc. Ethereum 3.0 wen?</li>\n<li>Alex Stokes, Researcher at the EF, delivered the State of Our Union Address, aiming at the more philosophical questions. Ethereum is a kind of state-building exercise, and it&#39;s worth striving for institutions that support tight-knit communities with a conviction to move towards a destination we expect to make everyone better off. How do we stay aligned? Focus on core values: credible neutrality, permissionless innovation, and concrete optimism. CN + PI means everyone is incentivized to play long-term cooperative for positive-sum. Problems are Lido dominance (where lido governance becomes eth governance) and staking issuance / MEV burn. When choices aren&#39;t obvious, use core values to guide decision making.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am not going to give a summary of every talk at the Fenbushi MEV Workshop because while it&#39;s all very interesting I could barely keep up sometimes. Running a relay does <em>not</em> make one an expert on searching and building. I&#39;ll break things down to the extent that I understand the content well enough to do so.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We started off with presentations by Yuki Yuminaga of Fenbushi and Alex of the ultrasound relay. Both talked about MEV-Boost relay incentivization. Yuki with a broader overview: validators and builders both benefit from relays but relays make no money :(. Alex with ultrasound&#39;s idea of modifying bids to capture the difference in value between one of their winning bids and the second-best relay&#39;s bid. Seems nice in that emulates the (established, working) systems for searchers and builders, each bidding against each other and capturing their surplus. Seems concerning in that going full competitive breaks a lot of the cooperative structure relays have built so far, and that the searcher/builder systems are centralizing <em>hard</em>.</li>\n<li>The biggest orderflow talk was Danning Sui of Flashbots, but it was a common topic in general. Danning had good visualizations of flow through searchers, order flow auctions (OFAs), builders, etc. All major players are vertically-integrated market makers, it&#39;s just the norm at this point. &gt;50% of DEX non-toxic order flow is already private. Every builder has private order flow, and there is a clear correlation between private flow and block inclusion rate. The theory all says that a small orderflow advantage and a small latency improvement means a <em>lot</em> more auction wins. Mempool Hygrometer dashboard in the links is really interesting.</li>\n<li>Audience question: &quot;Are we going to see [with vertical integration dominating] the demise of PBS?&quot; Max Resnick: &quot;Aren&#39;t we already?&quot; Possible better endgame: block building process happens entirely within the Ethereum protocol, in a system where builders can compete a bit but under very strict rules.</li>\n<li>L2s and user operations are really interesting sources of MEV, super complex to optimize (and even just to understand) but really interesting designs. Sequencers are likely to integrate PBS, or maybe more like proposer-prover separation, to create a competitive market for L2 block ordering. UserOp bundlers get a massive advantage from integration with block builders so that&#39;s just going to be another link in the vertically integrated chain.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ehh I think that&#39;s enough MEV stuff.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-15 06:20:55","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-11-15 06:43:37","id":"k9cxvzi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17vn3bx","parent_id":"t3_17vn3bx","score":43,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/austonst","body":"Links (i.e. what you should actually be reading):\n\n* [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/)\n* Staking Gathering [general info](https://ethstaker.cc/events/staking-gathering-2023) and [schedule](https://stakinggathering2023.sched.com/)\n* [Fenbushi Research Workshop 2 - MEV & Orderflow & PBS](https://lu.ma/MEVfenbushi)\n* [Portal Network](https://www.ethportal.net/)\n* Blockprint [dashboard](https://blockprint.sigp.io/) and [code](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint)\n* [EIP-6110](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6110)\n* [ETH DevOps GitHub](https://github.com/ethpandaops)\n* [dencun-devnet-11](https://dencun-devnet-11.ethpandaops.io/)\n* [A set-theoretic view of Ethereum coteries](https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/set-theoretic-ethereum)\n* [Yuki's relay incentivization article](https://mirror.xyz/0xE21b1e6f471EDeF18264e9BBe51b7fA7643EE6B5/0Sh7BDW7qgH_nadfqF8bpmnjxnfoYzPFvRdmoIoi9mg)\n* [Searcher-builder flow visualizations](https://www.searcherbuilder.pics/)\n* [Flashbots Mempool Dumpster Data](https://github.com/flashbots/mempool-dumpster)\n* [Mempool Hygrometer Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/flashbots/mempool-hygrometer)\n* [SMG paper on integrated builders](https://assets-global.website-files.com/642f3d0236c604d1022330f2/652edd75133e70ca4c74f5ea_Latency_Advantages_in_PBS.pdf)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Links (i.e. what you should actually be reading):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://devconnect.org/\">Devconnect</a></li>\n<li>Staking Gathering <a href=\"https://ethstaker.cc/events/staking-gathering-2023\">general info</a> and <a href=\"https://stakinggathering2023.sched.com/\">schedule</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lu.ma/MEVfenbushi\">Fenbushi Research Workshop 2 - MEV &amp; Orderflow &amp; PBS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ethportal.net/\">Portal Network</a></li>\n<li>Blockprint <a href=\"https://blockprint.sigp.io/\">dashboard</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sigp/blockprint\">code</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6110\">EIP-6110</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethpandaops\">ETH DevOps GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dencun-devnet-11.ethpandaops.io/\">dencun-devnet-11</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/set-theoretic-ethereum\">A set-theoretic view of Ethereum coteries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0xE21b1e6f471EDeF18264e9BBe51b7fA7643EE6B5/0Sh7BDW7qgH_nadfqF8bpmnjxnfoYzPFvRdmoIoi9mg\">Yuki&#39;s relay incentivization article</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.searcherbuilder.pics/\">Searcher-builder flow visualizations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/flashbots/mempool-dumpster\">Flashbots Mempool Dumpster Data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dune.com/flashbots/mempool-hygrometer\">Mempool Hygrometer Dune Dashboard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/642f3d0236c604d1022330f2/652edd75133e70ca4c74f5ea_Latency_Advantages_in_PBS.pdf\">SMG paper on integrated builders</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-15 06:22:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k9cy2z1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17vn3bx","parent_id":"t1_k9cxvzi","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"You are a hero.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You are a hero.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-15 10:13:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"k9dztp4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_17vn3bx","parent_id":"t1_k9cxvzi","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/offthewall1066","body":"I don't think I've ever seen more bearish sentiment on Ethereum's scaling roadmap.

I am  not sure why the ethereum-on-arm installation disk did not partition the disk. So i did it by hand using fdisk. The ethereum-on-arm installation configures /etc/fstab such that the SSD is expected to have a ext4 filesystem, which it mounts then as home directory. So I also formated the disk as ext4. After rebooting, everything was fine and I could start configuring the clients.\n\nSecurity wise, the ethereum-on-arm configuration is not super secure - they assume one runs it behind a router. I consider being behind a router not as secure, so I followed some standard security practises like disable root login per ssh, and disabled password access. I also activated the firewall, with only ssh and the p2p ports of the execution and consensus client open, and forwarded through my router.\n\nAs consensus client, I chose nimbus and as execution client nethermind.
