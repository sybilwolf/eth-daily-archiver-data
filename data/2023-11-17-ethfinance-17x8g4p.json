Time flies. As a corollary, I've realized I missed my chances to hit up the big sightseeing spots (Hagia Sophia, Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque kind of stuff) and maybe grab some gifts for the folks back home. I think I originally had planned to use today for some of that, but then I had to go and sign up for an extra event, and now the only free block of time left is early tomorrow morning... Maybe a quick trip somewhere then.\n\nAnyway, the event that took up all my sightseeing time was the Programmable Cryptography Conference, or Progcrypto, organized by 0xPARC and PSE. By *programmable* cryptography, they're referring to things like multi-party computation (MPC), zkSNARKs, and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). These are all systems through which different sorts of programs can be written and executed, with various benefits to security, privacy, computational efficiency, etc. And of course, the event covers interesting products built on top of them. I'm more familiar with this content than your average Etherean, but I still felt like a fish out of water.\n\nI'm not really sure what my goal is in summarizing these talks, maybe they can act as little teasers to get you interested in what's going on. I started off easing myself in with a track of 15 minute talks on applications and MPC:\n\n* Lyron Co Ting Keh of Seismic talked about interactive shielding. On platforms where users' data are individually shielded, it's difficult to create applications that rely on collaboration between state. Need some kind of MPC that is verifiable for external users, where participants can do full computation, and shielding is permeable. For this use case they prioritize a good UX, so they don't mind introducing a trusted \"provider\" entity. ZKPs (the P is for proof) go on-chain so that state transitions are protected by PoS, but the provider has a fully copy of the unshielded state. According to pre-defined rules the provider can selectively reveal information for participants to use as witnesses, but can't change state.\n* LauNaMu presented about the work she did with the team at Semaphore, a protocol for Ethereum users to prove their membership of a group for voting or authentication without revealing their identity. Semaphore was live for a long time but saw very little adoption, and wanted to find out why. They came up with a plan to identify their audiences, survey and interview them, and try to improve their website based on what they learned. Their new website clearly shows off projects using Semaphore, and their Build page has three options for flows to get you started.\n* Beyonder of PSE taught about how to have a good cryptographic UX. Obviously there's some natural conflict between security and usability. But we see way too much badness like ambiguous language, useless error messages (\"Oops, something went wrong!\"), and complex design. Goals should be simplicity, clarity, security, and accessibility.\n* Richard Liang and Sachin Kumar showed off their ZKP2P application, a trustless fiat to crypto onramp. It's possible to attest to web2 data using ZKPs, and ZK Email is a system already doing some of that (e.g. verify DKIM signatures and selectively disclose information). For ZKP2P, they build on top of Venmo. To buy USDC the web app directs you to a seller's Venmo account, you send them some cash, and then generate a ZK proof based on the *confirmation email that Venmo sends you*. So they kind of outsource the KYC to Venmo? I wouldn't be surprised if this violates some terms and conditions. Privacy is not the biggest concern so they generate proofs fast on the server side. Have to deal with a lot of potential attacks.\n* enrico.eth, Technical Lead at Summa @PSE, gave a good introduction to the relation between ZK and FHE, introducing a paradigm I saw elsewhere as well. You can imagine a central service that stores data for each of its users. You could develop an FHE scheme so that the server can't snoop on which user is requesting which of their data. But then you have an authentication problem: can you be sure that the requester *is* the user? So the requester additionally sends a ZKP proving 1. their identity via digital signature, 2. that the FHE encryption was performed correctly, and 3. that the plaintext input was actually their username.\n* Yuriko gave a very quick rundown of the math behind the BFV FHE scheme. I made it about halfway before my focus wavered for a second and I lost track of where we were going. But it generally seems pretty accessible. I'll link an article I found online below.\n* Rick Weber, an engineer at Sunscreen, talked about a path forward for FHE in Web3. Covered a bit of history, but apparently the two popular schemes now are BFV (slow) and TFHE (fast but approximate). Developers trying to get into FHE usage need to make similar obstacles as they do with ZKPs: time and size tradeoffs, and building a circuit. But FHE is much more parameter-sensitive: you need to be an expert or it gets slow. Sunscreen has a compiler from rust which automatically parallelizes the program and chooses optimal parameters, hopefully making FHE development easier.\n\nAfter lunch I went to the main stage for a bit:\n\n* gubsheep, Vitalik Buterin, Barry Whitehat, and Albert Ni had a discussion on stage on a variety of topics. Thinking about adoption of various disruptive technologies, desktop linux UX has gotten better in part due to the proliferation of web apps and WASM. Transformers (of the ML variety) have also been a paradigm shift in so many domains. Are zkSNARKs doing the same for cryptography? This time last year the sentiment was \"zk everything!\", but now we get a little more nuance and are looking at MPC and FHE through a new lens. Blockchains are probably better off throwing all their state and transitions in a SNARK at this point too. Are progcrypto and blockchain supporting each other? Is blockchain succeeding at being this degree of \"rethink everything\" transformative technology?\n* Nicholas Paul Brysiewicz, of the Long Now Foundation, was listed as giving a talk on High Dimensional Wayfinding which sounded neat I think? But he changed his topic to instead talk about, and I quote, how \"I think we need to think about the way we think about thinking\". The Long Now Foundation has done some projects like building a massive clock in a mountainside that's supposed to run for 10,000 years, and making \"Rosetta Disks\" with a lot of humanity's knowledge encoded and stored in a number of safe places (like an asteroid that passed by recently). To me it walks a veeery fine line between interesting art speculating on humanity's long-term future, and pretentious pseudo-philosophical BS. The talk fell more on the wrong side of that spectrum and was a lot of words to say very little.\n* Justin Drake came in to save the day, and explained how one-shot signatures will massively benefit blockchain consensus. This is a quantum signature scheme in which each private key can only be used to generate *one* signature before it self-destructs. You literally cannot double-sign, there are no slashable conditions, ETH becomes super-hyper-mega-ultrasound money. Can build blockchains with perfect finality and safe liquid staking. The explanation is pretty understandable, but we can't implement it until we get quantum computers. Justin wants to run a hash design competition to work on one of the remaining unsolved problems in its design.\n\nIn the afternoon I tried to tackle some more technical talks:\n\n* Dohoon Kim and Soowon Jeong covered lookup arguments for ZKPs. Lookup tables are a well-known concept in computer science where instead of computing a function when it's time-critical, you precompute most or all of the input-output pairs and store them in a table where they can be quickly looked up later. Apparently also useful in ZKPs. Of course, a large table slows down proving time, and so does a large number of lookups. Lasso is a system to handle this, which uses the SPARK compiler to deal with sparse matrices, and a method by which to decompose the lookup table to improve efficiency. Lasso is faster than non-lookup methods, and is about on par with a similar setup using LogUp and GKR.\n* Pierre, an applied zk researcher at 0xPARC, showed off a neat toy: zkConnect4. This is a zkSNARKified game of Connect 4 that contains the logic for running a small neural network agent as your opponent. The bot isn't great, it's easy to win. And when you do, you can generate a ZKP that you beat the bot, by providing your moves and the agent's weights as witnesses. The point is that it's a good example of the kind of repeated operations (taking turn after turn after turn) that their Nova recursive proof system is good at proving fast. This is called folding, and can bring big performance improvements.\n* Lev Soukhanov talked about Protostar, another folding scheme whose arithmetization is more generic than Plonkish and R1CS arithmetization. Got a little too technical for me, but I haven't written enough circuits.\n\nBy the way: ETHDenver is planning to open 2024 registrations on November 20th. Very soon. Their legal folks have asked them to make membership in SporkDAO more formal, so **you will need to stake at least one $SPORK in order to get free admission**. If you've attended in previous years there's a good chance you have some $SPORK, and if not then they plan to have a way to earn enough. Just keep an eye out.\n\nOh no I almost hit the 10k character limit.

This is a zkSNARKified game of Connect 4 that contains the logic for running a small neural network agent as your opponent. The bot isn&#39;t great, it&#39;s easy to win. And when you do, you can generate a ZKP that you beat the bot, by providing your moves and the agent&#39;s weights as witnesses. The point is that it&#39;s a good example of the kind of repeated operations (taking turn after turn after turn) that their Nova recursive proof system is good at proving fast. This is called folding, and can bring big performance improvements.</li>\n<li>Lev Soukhanov talked about Protostar, another folding scheme whose arithmetization is more generic than Plonkish and R1CS arithmetization. Got a little too technical for me, but I haven&#39;t written enough circuits.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By the way: ETHDenver is planning to open 2024 registrations on November 20th. Very soon. Their legal folks have asked them to make membership in SporkDAO more formal, so <strong>you will need to stake at least one $SPORK in order to get free admission</strong>. If you&#39;ve attended in previous years there&#39;s a good chance you have some $SPORK, and if not then they plan to have a way to earn enough.
