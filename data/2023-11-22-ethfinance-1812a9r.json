Now I've been donating to Gitcoin for a long time. Since either 2019 or 2020 (I forget). This year's experience has been by far the worst experience I have had yet. So far I have been mostly unbothered by the Gitcoin dramas like funding for wokeness (let the people fund what they want) and accepting money from Shell (fuck Shell but why would you turn down money from them unless there are some really troublesome stipulations, which as I understood it, there weren't). But their current UX is a joke. So here's my latest Gitcoin experience:\n\nI click on Superphiz's bundle. There is no obvious donate button. I just want to send $20 to the entire bundle, I trust Superphiz's judgement. There is no button for it. Instead I have to click the tiny cart button on each project one by one to add them. Kind of annoying and not the most intuitive but to be fair I should've been more observant, plus now I have to check each project individually so i can make sure they are all ones I want to contribute to which is wise and I should've wanted to do this anyway.\n\nNow I have these projects in my cart so I go to checkout. I am greeted with a list of the 14 projects and a field to quantify my donation for each one. The list is broken down by network. Wait... these projects are split throughout 3 different networks? Well that's kind of annoying but thankfully I have funds on most L2s. Ah shit, Public Goods Network? Ok fine, I'll bridge some funds there. *clicks on official bridge link* $8 gas fees just to bridge?! That's almost half the size of my donation! Since there is no option to bridge from an L2 to PGN, I better find a bridge which lets me do that.\n\n> \\> Public Goods Network Docs > Bridging > 3 Options\n\n- \u274c Official Bridge (High main net gas fee)\n\n- \u274c 3rd Party bridge #1 (also only from main net)\n\n- \u2705 3rd party bridge #2\n\nI finally bridge some funds on bridge #2 though it does have high commission fees ($2 on a $30 tx)\n\nAnyway, I finally have some funds there so I select how much I want to donate... Wait, the Polygon projects only accept Polygon/MATIC and USDC? No ETH?! Bruh...\n\nCool, now I have to go to a Dex + L2 aggregator and once again swap from ETH on one chain to USDC on Polygon.\n\nAt this point I have already spent 15 minutes on what should be a 1 minute transaction. But wait, there's more! While I had some USDC on Polygon, I didn't have any Polygon/MATIC tokens to pay the gas fee with. So another 5 mins later I have bridged over some MATIC and I can finally send the TX.\n\nNow I look at the matching and realise I need to review my Gitcoin passport. So I open a new tab to check out my Passport. The passport isn't perfect but no identity solution is. I will ignore my issues with Passport here but they are an honest effort, I just think they should put less emphasis on web 2 solutions. Also, on the topic of matching, it is no longer clear how much or which projects receive how much matching. From what it looked like, one project in the bundle was going to receive all of the matching and frankly I didn\u2019t want that. I almost considered not donating to that project because such a matching would be unfair. But I think it was just an unclear/messy UI.\n\nFinally, I have made the transactions on Optimism and Polygon with the required assets. Just one more tx to send on Public Goods Network and it has been pending for the last 3 hours as I post this...\n\n#*Bruh*\n\nSo anyway, in case you are unaware, most people don't want to spend all day making a charitable donation! I'm giving others my money. I don't want to lose a lot of my time too or I just won't do it. Gitcoin needs to make this easier.\n\n***Here's my recommendation:*** Integrate with one of the 2 in 1 DApps which are an L2 Bridge + Dex (someone please remind me what they're called). Accept any asset on any chain and convert it for the users who don't have funds in the form of all assets on every chain. This can either be done by each individual so that every project receives what they want, where they want, or Gitcoin could distribute and swap funds as required at the end of each round, a bit like settling a bar tab. This would be more complicated and funds wouldn't be immediate but it would drastically reduce losses to bridging and swapping.\n\n#TL;DR:\n\nCurrently their system is backwards. The projects request what they want and on what chain, putting all the hard work and effort into the hands of the donors to ensure they have what they need to give where they have to give it for every single one of the many projects they want to contribute to. This is horrible UX and if it doesn't get better, it will be enough to stop even long time contributors such as myself from contributing in the future.\n\n**P.S:** If you know someone working for Gitcoin who we could get this feedback to, please speak up. I want to help improve Gitcoin, not just rant and potentially discourage people from donating. Also, please donate. It is worth it. We desperately need to fund projects which promote decentralisation.

But I think it was just an unclear/messy UI.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I have made the transactions on Optimism and Polygon with the required assets. Just one more tx to send on Public Goods Network and it has been pending for the last 3 hours as I post this...</p>\n\n<h1><em>Bruh</em></h1>\n\n<p>So anyway, in case you are unaware, most people don&#39;t want to spend all day making a charitable donation! I&#39;m giving others my money. I don&#39;t want to lose a lot of my time too or I just won&#39;t do it. Gitcoin needs to make this easier.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Here&#39;s my recommendation:</em></strong> Integrate with one of the 2 in 1 DApps which are an L2 Bridge + Dex (someone please remind me what they&#39;re called). Accept any asset on any chain and convert it for the users who don&#39;t have funds in the form of all assets on every chain. This can either be done by each individual so that every project receives what they want, where they want, or Gitcoin could distribute and swap funds as required at the end of each round, a bit like settling a bar tab. This would be more complicated and funds wouldn&#39;t be immediate but it would drastically reduce losses to bridging and swapping.</p>\n\n<h1>TL;DR:</h1>\n\n<p>Currently their system is backwards. The projects request what they want and on what chain, putting all the hard work and effort into the hands of the donors to ensure they have what they need to give where they have to give it for every single one of the many projects they want to contribute to. This is horrible UX and if it doesn&#39;t get better, it will be enough to stop even long time contributors such as myself from contributing in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>P.S:</strong> If you know someone working for Gitcoin who we could get this feedback to, please speak up. I want to help improve Gitcoin, not just rant and potentially discourage people from donating. Also, please donate. It is worth it. We desperately need to fund projects which promote decentralisation. Plus you&#39;d make Superphiz happy which is always nice.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-21 23:54:56","distinguished":null,"edited":"2023-11-22 00:11:44","id":"ka9wqpf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1812a9r","parent_id":"t3_1812a9r","score":41,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/alexiskef","body":"I had the EXACT same shitty experience..

Fork Optimism slap a token on it. Same with ZKSwap they forked ZKsync lite and tried to meme into existence with airdrop farming around 2020/2021. It did not work out for them very well. But yes, I am expecting some of the griftier groups do a similar thing with zksync era. To do it seriously and more of a long term play, I also think finding good developers who are actually capable of developing faster than the original team is really hard. In the end everyone knows that your are a freeloader and legitimacy is a rather rare good in the space and very hard to gain after such a start.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-11-22 08:06:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kabc5cn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1812a9r","parent_id":"t1_kab97d6","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/doomfuzzslayer","body":"So Layer 0 identifies and calls out the grift, making it hard for the copy paste VC L2 to gain adoption.
