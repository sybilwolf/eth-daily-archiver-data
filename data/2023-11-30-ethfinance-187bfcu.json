Smart Chain may have entered a fork condition because of a bug introduced into bsc-geth.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1730239018619613667\n\nI'd like to draw your attention to what this COULD mean for binance chain, and why it's important for us to learn from it. To be clear, I didn't study the binance incident, I'm taking a general lesson from what MIGHT have happened, and definitely editorializing to hammer the point. Please don't tell me I'm wrong about the incident, I'm applying this to our chain and I don't care about BSC.\n\nIt looks like bsc-geth, a majority client on Binance Smart Chain could have introduced a bug that was enshrined in the chain because bsc-geth is a majority client. bsc-erigon has been unable to follow the new canonical bsc chain because it did not accept this bugged version of the bsc chain.\n\nThere are two potential corrections:\n\n1. Introduce the same bug into bsc-erigon and make the wrong chain the canonical chain (with minimal disruption in the chain, but maximum social disruption)\n\n2. Undo/Redo/Slash/Roll-back bsc chain to correct the error in the chain and move forward with a correct state, but resulting in devastating chain consequences.\n\nThis should be a HUGE red flag to Ethereans that solidifies our concerns about client majorities. If geth introduced a bug into our execution layer we'd be in the exact same predicament. \n\nHow do we prevent it? By using minority clients, EVEN if they're more buggy and/or less performant.\n\nWhy? We have about 4.5 execution clients right now: geth, nethermind, besu, erigon, and reth (rust Ethereum). If each of those clients has ~20% - ~25% of the share, ANY one of them could fail or introduce a bug and the network will shit a brick but keep going on the right chain, essentially falling to 75% efficiency until that bug is fixed in that single client.\n\nAS IT STANDS, geth has 84% of the execution chain market share. If geth introduces any bug into the chain, it will become the canonical chain, and the other 3.5 clients representing 16% of the chain will just be ignored. \n\nTHIS is why client diversity on both the execution AND consensus layers is so important. See https://clientdiversity.org/ for more info.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the design principles of Ethereum, one point you should know is that in Ethereum, the spec leads the implementation, the implementation doesn't lead the spec. This can take awhile to understand, but it essentially means that we design the chain carefully, then write code to support that spec; we don't write production code and then try to write documentation explaining what that code does.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Binance Smart Chain may have entered a fork condition because of a bug introduced into bsc-geth.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1730239018619613667\">https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1730239018619613667</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to draw your attention to what this COULD mean for binance chain, and why it&#39;s important for us to learn from it.

Let me begin by disagreeing with the sibling comment - no, not every vault has the same safety level. Every vault operator is responsible for their own slashing protection measures, infrastructure security, and operations in general. If the vault operator you choose experiences a slashing event it will affect you as a vault depositor too. (Do note in the vast majority of cases a slashing event means losing a bit more than 1/32ETH per validator).\n\nI think you shouldn't focus too much on picking a dominant vault, that will just lead to more centralization. Instead, I would suggest you look at:\n\n**1) Operations**\n\nRead the vault descriptions, look for things that are good for the Ethereum network in general - using minority clients, geographical distribution...\n\nCheck how they protect against slashing events. Some operators may even have their own slashing insurance, either through a 3rd party or their own insurance fund.\n\n**2) Reputation/contributions**\n\nYou may not know some of the vault operators. That doesn't necessarily mean they're not reputable. Read their vault description, go to their website, social media, that should give you an idea of how reputable they are.\n\nDo they actively contribute to the wider ecosystem? Look for open-source projects that relate to (staking) Ethereum (as an example I'll mention CryptoManufaktur, the team behind eth-docker).\n\n\n**3) Performance**\n\nVaults using minority clients may have slightly lower performance but are doing something very important for the network. Take that into account, a 95 vs 100 performance score is not going to have a huge effect on final APR. Since mainnet just launched, many vaults do not have a high TVL (most don't even have 32ETH for a single validator yet). You can however go to https://testnet.stakewise.io/ and check the performance of operators on testnet, that will give you a good idea of what to expect.\n\n**4) Fees**\n\nLast but not least, obviously take the vault fee into account.
