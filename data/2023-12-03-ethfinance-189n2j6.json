Because of that I think it's dangerous to not do anything about the issues that we have with /r/ethereum. Because left untouched, they will have real impact into the Ethereum's culture the same way /r/bitcoin had an outstanding impact into what bitcoin culture is today. Reddit is still to this day the biggest internet forum, we cannot underestimate its impact on the perception the world has on Ethereum and its influence on the values the community aligns to.\n\nThis community (/r/ethfinance) exists mainly because in /r/ethereum it was forbidden to discuss price. And people want to be able to chat in a relaxed manner also about that, so they created /r/ethtrader which then lead to /r/ethfinance. But this subreddit is basically restricted to a daily. To be honest, it /r/ethereum allowed price discussion in the daily like we do here. We might as well simply merge the two. And /r/ethereum may not require much in terms of moderation rule changes. I think it requires more active moderators, spread across timezones. And higher engagement from the community.\n\nThe last mod added to /r/ethereum seems to be Justin Drake. Justin is an excellent researcher, very well respected, a voice of reason. Tons of positive attributes. But he is not active on reddit. Adding more researchers of the Ethereum foundation is not gonna solve anything. You need to add active redditors that have strong alignment with Ethereum. People like /u/phimarhal , /u/aesthtk , /u/jtnichol ... Just throwing some names out there, plenty others will do an excellent job too, I'm sure.\n\nIn summary, my suggested action plan. \n\n- Add new moderators, from the pool of active redditors that have shown strong alignment to Ethereum through the years. Plenty to choose from.\n\n- For this community to engage actively in /r/ethereum . Helping with the soft moderation aspects. Upvoting/downvoting. Reporting scams/spams so they can be taken out swiftly. Contributing with helpful content.\n\n- (Optional) As a means to achieve that, allow a daily in the spirit of /r/ethfinance daily. Where a relaxed chat can be had. A bit of price discussion, a bit of memeing, but also problem solving. If there is social consensus about it perhaps we can move /r/ethfinance back into /r/ethereum. This can ensure that the active redditors stick around and help with point 2. Maintain the stricter ruleset of no price-discussion to the self posts.\n\nIf you notice the idea behind this is not to forbid any content or ban users. Is to up the signal to noise ratio. Which I think it's perfectly possible, because otherwise this subreddit would have already fallen prey to the noise too. /r/ethfinance is not too hard to find for the trolls and scammers, it's just better guarded through active moderation and soft moderation by its users.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I find your take very sensible.
