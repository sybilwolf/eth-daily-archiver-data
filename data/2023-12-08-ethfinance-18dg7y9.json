Cartesi rollup dapps can use their PoS chain for data availability. About 75% of token issued so far. Staking return is about 18% ish. Its a gamble but I think I good one given its applicability as a  general purpose ETH rolllup that hasn\u2019t caught on much yet - and low MC of 130M. 10-20x is  my hope. This is just a random crypto guys take so dyor of course. \ncartesi.io </p>\n\n<p>Ps bitboy ran a validator for them at one point and promoted the project which is red flag imo but one I\u2019m willing to live with.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-08 16:23:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kckm0wg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18dg7y9","parent_id":"t1_kcjab9a","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Blocks_and_Chains","body":"Great to see your interest in Cartesi.
