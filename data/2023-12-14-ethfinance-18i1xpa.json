In my opinion, parallelization is not the bottleneck on Ethereums side just yet, it is probably more important for L2s. The Bottleneck is rather the state size and how it is stored/accessed which needs to be solved before one can reap benefits from a fully parallelized EVM. And I am not aware that Solana has solved that issue, but as always I could be very wrong there.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2023-12-14 08:11:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kdc3n2k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18i1xpa","parent_id":"t1_kdaoh52","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/labrav","body":"Thanks!
