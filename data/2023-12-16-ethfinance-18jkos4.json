My several thousand holesky validators are choochin' away with no significant hiccups. Running geth/lighthouse at the moment. Still haven't gotten around to setting a withdrawal address for them. For some reason I started having  a difficult time picking up peers on this machine. Since launch I have been stable at 1round 15 peers, but over the last week that has dropped to 1-2 and sometimes 0 peers. Surprisingly, and this is more of a testament to the design of the network, my average effectiveness hardly dropped at all during this. I remained in the mid to high 80's. \n\nI did do some changing of my network setup and for a few hours I had the holesky machine connected to both wifi and ethernet...I believe the machine had two IP addresses assigned to it and that may have caused some wires (or em waves?) to cross.\n\nI decided to go ahead and forward the ports associated with the EL/CL applications, something I have not had to do with the rocketpool or solo machines. Both of those machines have 50+ peers running out of the box setups and nothing besides a static IP assigned to them. Anyway, running this setup overnight has brought the machine up to the max specified 50 peers and I foresee no other changes needing to be made as far as networking goes.\n\nThe other fun part about all this is that I have finally pulled the trigger on a nice little rackmount setup. Not necessary (by a *longshot*), but a lot of fun for a self-proclaimed computer enthusiast. Over the last couple years I have collected some rackmount equipment that I have come across for free/cheap. UPS' that are being tossed just needed a couple new batteries. Gigabit switches that just need a new SFP adapter, etc. Color coding the patch cables and swapping out USB/HDMI/ethernet keystones to make it all look neat and professional. I made a custom mount for a gas spring arm for a monitor on the back of it. There are these cool 1U flip up monitors you can buy that are like 700 quatloos ....yeah....nah....I'll use my free, collecting dust in a corner monitor instead. I have discovered that any normal computer component becomes 10x more expensive if it has \"enterprise\" or \"rackmount\" in the name. \n\n I am trying to convince another local ISP that I am a business so they will install a fiber line directly to me. My understanding is that the install would be free, and the monthly cost would be more than what I am paying now, but not wholly unreasonable considering how much time and bandwidth I use. I have been close to picking up a dream machine pro because of the sale ubiquiti has had on it...apparently they never do discounts...but after perusing through the rest of their hardware if I fall down that rabbit hole it'll take eth breaking 100K before I can pay off the credit card bill. They've got some good lookin' hardware. That said...if I am a *business*, then that can all be written off...so less taxes...and there I go talking myself into it again. I'll stop now.\n\nThe nodeset machine is up and running as well, just waiting to be assigned. I am looking forward to that launch next year. There's a lot to look forward to, and a lot of good work being done combat the biggest threat to ethereum's credible neutrality. It should remain on everyone's mind that the priority needs to be the health of the network. *Any* entity that approaches 33% is a threat to credible neutrality. Doubly so for an entity that *says out loud* that they do not care and will continue to grow in an attempt to harm the network in pursuit of greater profit. \n\nJust so everyone is clear: **there is no debate about this**. Let us keep fighting the good fight, less we lose the greatest value prop of ethereum. \n\nI'll keep the staking machines running. Sip some coffee. Get my steps in. Enjoy the beginnings of the bull and patiently await new ATH's. Post here, and occasionally degen 100x some coins *no one* should touch with a ten foot pole. You know...for fun.

In my college years I used to make my money playing online poker and this is an important concept there. I believe it's equally important in investing.\n\n**Poker**\n\nResult oriented thinking is when poker players start to second guess their strategy because of a hand they lost. There are a few different levels of result oriented thinking here, some are easy to spot and some are tricky.\n\n*Example1:*\n\nWe are pre-flop. I have AA and someone goes all-in before me. I call and we turn our hands over. My opponent has KK. I have around 88% chance to win this hand. The board comes 2346K. I lose the hand.\n\n*Example2:*\n\nWe are pre-flop and we are between 20 and 50 big blinds deep. I have KK. My opponent, that I've never played against before, pushes me all in. We turn over our hands and he has AA. There is no help on the board and I lose the hand.\n\n*Example3:*\n\nWe are pre-flop on a table with 9 players. We are between 50 and 100 big blinds deep. I have an opponent that I know. He is a very tight player (plays very few hands) and is never agressive before the flop. I have KK. My opponent's turn is first and he bets 3 big blinds. Everyone folds and then it's my turn. I raise. My opponent pushes all in. Even though I know this player has a monster hand, I still call because I have KK. He turns over AA and I lose the hand.\n\nIn example 1 it's quite obvious that I made the right choice. I got my money in with the best chance to win and got unlucky. It's unlikely that results-oriented thinking makes me regret my decision, so I will play the exact same way next time.\n\nIn example 2 it's a little more tricky. In this particular hand it looks like I made the wrong decision, because my hand was beat. 'Results oriented thinking' could lead me to fold next time in the same spot. However that would be wrong. Without knowing anything about my opponent's hand, KK is a good hand to call with in 80-90% of the times. It just turned out to be  against AA this time. I got unlucky but I shouldn't change my strategy. If you always fold in that situation, you are going to lose money long term.\n\nExample 3 is even more tricky, because now you have a read and a hunch. You know that the optimal strategy to use against a random player is to never fold KK in a situation like this. But against this particular person, maybe it can be better to fold. After seeing that he indeed has AA, should you learn from this situation and play the exact situation different next time? Or is that 'Results oriented thinking'?\n\nPoker is a game with chance and uncertainty, so it's not optimal to adjust your strategy every time you make a decision that nets you a bad result. Maybe you make a bluff that doesn't work, does that mean you should never bluff in that situation? Or was it going to work enough times to make it worth it, even though it didn't work this time? Maybe you lose with a straight to a flush, does that mean you should have folded?\n\nThe tricky part of honing your poker strategy is deciding when your strategy was correct, regardless of the results, and when there is something to learn from the results. If you always stick to your strategy you never improve. But if you change your strategy on a whim with every bad result you get, you will learn absolutely terrible lessons which is even worse.\n\nThe fundamental question with every bad result is: Should I adjust my priors or is this result oriented thinking only?\n\n**Investing**\n\nI'm sure the analogy and where I'm going with this isn't lost on you. I think my poker examples #2 and #3 apply most to investing, because you never have that absolute certainty that you were ahead when you made the decision like with my AA in example #1. If you see a random shitcoin pump while ETH stays flat, then thinking 'I should have sold all my ETH to that shitcoin' is an example of result oriented thinking. Even though that shitcoin outperformed, you couldn't have known and in the long term this is going to be a bad strategy.\n\nLike I said it's possible to overadjust, or underadjust your priors based on results and both are suboptimal. I'm going to take the extremes of both groups to make that point clear.\n\n**Overadjusters and underadjusters**\n\nOveradjusters are the pump chasers. They see that 'insert random shitcoin' outperformed and rotate into that shitcoin. Then they see 'shiny dog coin' outperform and rotate into that. It's not hard to see that they will get rekt fairly soon.\n\nUnderadjusters are no-coiners. They have seen Bitcoin pump on a cyclical basis many times now, yet continue to believe that all results are based on luck. They believe it's not possible to outperform the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis, so if you bought ETH under $100 then you got extremely lucky and it's result-oriented thinking to believe otherwise.\n\nIf you are here, then you are already somewhere in the middle. You do believe that outperformance is possible, because you are invested in ETH rather than the S&P 500 only. All further discussions about optimal crypto investment strategy, are in my opinion about when you should update your priors and when you shouldn't. Where are you an overadjuster and when an underadjuster.\n\n**Granularity of our communication**\n\nI think we talk past eachother a lot when we are discussing investment strategy here if we don't have proper terms for overadjusting and underadjusting, because it depends on each individual case and circumstance. When /u/yourcounterparty says it might be good to hold on to the TIA airdrop because it has VC pumpers and a clean chart, they ask you to consider adjusting your priors just slightly for this particular scenario. They don't tell you to become an overadjuster and just trade shitcoins all day. Mind you, they could still be wrong and just lucky with this particular call and that is up for debate. It's up to everyone to see if you will update your priors on airdrops to ETH-killers with VC-backing. I know I have updated mine a little bit.\n\nEvery time a discussion about assets with questionable fundamentals arises, the default position of many is that you cannot know if it will pump, and therefore it's gambling. I think that's the wrong way to think about it. Instead we should think if there is any information to be learned, or if it's only result oriented thinking.\n\nLastly, being conservative with adjusting your investment strategy can be good in it's own right if you already know it to be profitable. Given that overadjusting can get you rekt fast, it's probably even good to be conservative. But that doesn't mean that it's always optimal.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I want to discuss with you, my investor friends, the concept of &#39;Result Oriented Thinking&#39;.
