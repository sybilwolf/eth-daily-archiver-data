it happened all the way back in June of 2022 - and since then, contrary to popular belief, ETH has performed quite well on a risk-adjusted basis (up 2.5x from the bottom).*  \n*But of course, if you just sit on crypto twitter all day, you probably think Ethereum is dead and ETH is going to $0 - the reality is that Ethereum and ETH have never been stronger and I firmly believe ETH is going to have an explosive 2024.*  \n*I also see people saying that Ethereum has no \u201ccatalysts\u201d and no \u201cnarratives\u201d that people can get excited about which is extremely puzzling to me as I believe Ethereum has more of these than any other ecosystem.*  \n*Though don\u2019t just take my word for it, here are just some of the main things to get excited about in the world of Ethereum in 2024:*  \n*- Possible spot ETH ETF approval (May is the final deadline for some applications)*  \n*- EigenLayer/restaking goes live unlocking a major new primitive for Ethereum*  \n*- Continued ETH supply decrease from the fee burn (already at lowest levels since The Merge)*  \n*- Dencun upgrade goes live in March/April and brings with it EIP-4844 (lowers L2 gas costs)*  \n*- Increased L2 adoption across the board (activity at all time highs right now)*  \n*- Non-EVM L2's like*   \nEclipseFND  \n *and*   \nfluentxyz  \n *launching (brings in new types of apps/developers)*  \n*- The L2 ecosystem, led by Immutable, will become the home of crypto gaming*  \n*- Major Ethereum projects will do their airdrops and attract a lot of fresh capital because of it*  \n*- Wallet UX will continue to improve at a rapid pace and onboard millions of new users to the Ethereum ecosystem*  \n*- RWA will continue to grow and bring more of the \u201cold world\u201d financial products onchain*  \n*Funny enough, even though Ethereum has all of these catalysts and more, the most bullish thing for ETH is still just for ETH to go up - any experienced crypto participant knows that narrative follows price and when ETH starts outperforming, suddenly all of these \"issues\" that people have with Ethereum will disappear.*  \n*As a long-time Etherean, it\u2019s nothing new to have to deal with the \"crowd\" being bearish on Ethereum or fading ETH -

Now I know most of us here are thoroughly in the proof of stake camp for consensus but at the end of the day all our stake is doing is serving as a basis for Sybil resistance so a bunch of nodes can vote on what the truth is. At the end of the day it's just majority rules. Ethereum solves Sybil resistance by making participants proof they have something. Bitcoin solves Sybil resistance by making participants prove they spent something. That's obviously quite wasteful if you spent that something while getting nothing but Sybil resistance in return but what if the work produced something of inherent value?\n\nThe most famous form of proof of work is hashing. However, the nature of the work can take many forms so long as the task meets a few basic requirements.\n\n* There needs to be an unlimited supply of whatever task. You can't be halting your consensus mechanism while waiting for work to arrive.\n\n* The work needs to be verifiable in much less time than it can be done. This is O(c) for hashing but it could be some reasonably small O(n) while still being viable.\n\nSo, are there any other \"infinite\" demand tasks exist with a statistically verifiable outcome? At least one important one is AI training. At least for certain types of AI you're basically just tuning an extraordinarily large array of numbers. That tuning works like a search that takes place over *many* iterations. Each iteration outputs a vector in that space which is basically your proof of work. In a large enough search space, guessing the right direction is basically impossible. So, to get a coherent direction consistently you need to actually do the training work. This is basically the insight of [GenSyn](https://www.gensyn.ai/).\n\nSo, now you spend electricity and rather than getting BTC which is just a proof of spend, you get ownership over the model you helped train. Once you have Sybil resistance through this means you can pile on an EVM, SVM, or whatever you like on top of it. Think of it as swapping out *just* the consensus client. People do work and prove they are real, real people just vote on the truth of the state machine. Majority still rules.\n\nThere are some potential advantages here to decentralization. PoS at least has a cost of the time cost of the capital that is parked there. Useful PoW might have actually no cost if the economic value of what is produced by the work is greater than the spend required to produce it. Also, anyone with a graphics card powerful enough to iterate on the model can participate without having to hold $64k in ETH. The waste of the system is reduced to the verification time on all participants. That can be offset by the transaction costs of the network being secured.\n\nI just thought it was an interesting line of thought worth sharing. There are forms of work outside of AI but this is one that I came across in my consulting work. Also BitTensor had a [pretty good primer](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/feature/consensus-readme/docs/consensus.md) on the ecosystem of PoW systems if you want to get your head out of the Ethereum ecosystem for a minute.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Have any of you heard of &quot;useful&quot; proof of work? Now I know most of us here are thoroughly in the proof of stake camp for consensus but at the end of the day all our stake is doing is serving as a basis for Sybil resistance so a bunch of nodes can vote on what the truth is. At the end of the day it&#39;s just majority rules. Ethereum solves Sybil resistance by making participants proof they have something. Bitcoin solves Sybil resistance by making participants prove they spent something. That&#39;s obviously quite wasteful if you spent that something while getting nothing but Sybil resistance in return but what if the work produced something of inherent value?</p>\n\n<p>The most famous form of proof of work is hashing. However, the nature of the work can take many forms so long as the task meets a few basic requirements.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There needs to be an unlimited supply of whatever task. You can&#39;t be halting your consensus mechanism while waiting for work to arrive.</p></li>\n<li><p>The work needs to be verifiable in much less time than it can be done. This is O(c) for hashing but it could be some reasonably small O(n) while still being viable.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, are there any other &quot;infinite&quot; demand tasks exist with a statistically verifiable outcome? At least one important one is AI training. At least for certain types of AI you&#39;re basically just tuning an extraordinarily large array of numbers. That tuning works like a search that takes place over <em>many</em> iterations. Each iteration outputs a vector in that space which is basically your proof of work. In a large enough search space, guessing the right direction is basically impossible. So, to get a coherent direction consistently you need to actually do the training work. This is basically the insight of <a href=\"https://www.gensyn.ai/\">GenSyn</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, now you spend electricity and rather than getting BTC which is just a proof of spend, you get ownership over the model you helped train. Once you have Sybil resistance through this means you can pile on an EVM, SVM, or whatever you like on top of it. Think of it as swapping out <em>just</em> the consensus client. People do work and prove they are real, real people just vote on the truth of the state machine. Majority still rules.</p>\n\n<p>There are some potential advantages here to decentralization. PoS at least has a cost of the time cost of the capital that is parked there. Useful PoW might have actually no cost if the economic value of what is produced by the work is greater than the spend required to produce it. Also, anyone with a graphics card powerful enough to iterate on the model can participate without having to hold $64k in ETH. The waste of the system is reduced to the verification time on all participants. That can be offset by the transaction costs of the network being secured.</p>\n\n<p>I just thought it was an interesting line of thought worth sharing.
