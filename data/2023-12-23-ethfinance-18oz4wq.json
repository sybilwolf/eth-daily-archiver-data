On top of that, node operators also have to take on token risk by providing RPL as collateral. Sadly, a whole lot of people do not like that model. \n\nThe scramble by LST services happened pretty quickly, and the Rocket Pool community and team were quick to realise we needed to change things. The community set up the [Rapid Research Incubator](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/options-forum-thread/2515) as a way to come up with new tokenomics to respond to Lido's threat. You can see that some great ideas are already being submitted. The incubator is $10,000 of prizes for tokenomics ideas submissions. 12 ideas will win $250, 3 will win $1000, 1 will get $1500, and 1 will get $2500.
