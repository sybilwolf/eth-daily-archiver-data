I thought Ethereum might use a system similar to pseudo-random number generators in traditional computing, where a deterministic, randomized list is accessed via a seed. I thought that a validator's index number could influence their chance of being selected.\n\nHowever, Ethereum's method is quite different. Apparently, Ethereum uses a complex combination of Randomness Derived from a Commit-Reveal Scheme (RANDAO) and a Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). In this system, validators contribute to the network's randomness by providing a hash of a secret number which is revealed from all participating validators that are combined to generate a random value. Then, the output of the RANDAO is used as an input to the VDF which ensures that no single participant can influence the randomness, as it requires a specific amount of time to produce the output, regardless of computational power. So it seems like a validator\u2019s index number is just an identifier and doesn\u2019t affect their chances of being selected.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve researched a bit and it seems like the index number indeed doesn&#39;t make a difference.
