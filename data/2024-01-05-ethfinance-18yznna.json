Also there are almost 5 million wallets farming this airdrop. From my quick research to move up in the rankings: time interacting with zk contracts and number of transactions weigh heavily towards the drop. Also $$$$ bridged plays a factor. Studying the top 100 wallets, the bridged amount of funds ranges from $10k-$1.4 million. There is one wallet that bridged $3800 and has 86 transactions over 9+months in the top 100. I\u2019ve heard speculation that transactions should be limited to 1x a day. Bouncing around in a weekend could be seen as a Sybil and disqualify your wallet. I\u2019m not here to discourage anyone from playing on L2 but the reality is this isn\u2019t a walk in the park and will take daily usage and funds for several months just to have a potential shot. Plus the snap shot window is something to consider. I know several lions on discord have interacted for months with serious capital and range in the top 300k. Arbitrum cutoff was roughly 600k. My casual zk interaction is way off from being included. Esp if they don\u2019t count zklite activity. I used zklite over 2 years ago but wallet tracking sites don\u2019t include that data. Only Era transactions. For absolute clarity this is all speculation on my part but I\u2019ve been trying to glean as much info on the matter as possible. I hope this helps.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-05 08:19:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kgg72iy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18yznna","parent_id":"t1_kgfjwjj","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ivaylo_eth","body":"Would you mind sharing the dashboard you use when you refer to top 100 wallets, top 300K, etc?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Would you mind sharing the dashboard you use when you refer to top 100 wallets, top 300K, etc?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-06 09:27:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kglvfxe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_18yznna","parent_id":"t1_kgg72iy","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Luukiemans","body":"Verify your EVM (if you still hold one) and enjoy the endless free alpha in our farmers channel.
