While I can't get into the specific schemes I use to keep mine secure, here are some general guidelines I follow that have worked for me since I created my first crypto wallet in the early 2010s.\n\n* Always prefer open-source over closed-source. Never trust closed-source software with your main stack. Only use the most popular, well-vetted open source software.\n\n* Strike a balance between safety and recoverability (make your keys safe enough that they don't get stolen, but not so \"safe\" they you lose the only copy of them).\n\n* Have no single point of failure, wherever possible. Split your assets across addresses. Split your key across physical locations. But it's gotta be more sophisticated than just putting 12 words in one place and 12 words in another, because afaik 12 words can be bruteforced. Wish I could be more specific about this. Some wallets support Shamir, which can be a good way to do this. Gnosis Safe is less flexible but perhaps the only smart contract out there to be trusted with someone's main stack.\n\n* Do not use the same PC user account for crypto that you use for your daily tasks. Ideally, have a crypto-only \"online\" computer that runs something other than Windows. Maintain a minimal software footprint on it. Log into it periodically to keep the OS up to date.\n\n* Also keep a crypto-only \"offline\" computing device that never touches the internet. If it's a PC, it needs to be running a very mainstream very publicly-audited version of Linux like ubuntu, fedora, debian, etc. A hardware wallet counts as long as the design is open and the firmware is open-source, but it has some trade-offs you'll have to weigh for yourself.\n\n* Do everything (concerning your main stack) in multiple batches. Everything. Even the most simple transfers from one address to another that seem like they would be impossible to fuck up, because trust me it's possible to fuck up - if not by your own accord, then by some tricky dicky scheme whereby a hacker replaces addresses in your computer's memory or uses some other silly scheme to bamboozle you. It'll be more expensive to batch things as far as transaction fees, but it's not possible for a single huge fuckup to ruin you. Nobody is perfect, but managing crypto demands perfection. If you send your entire stack off to some rando etherscan spoofer or directly to the token contract itself, there's no getting it back.\n\n* When you're confirming an address, check it from two different devices running different OSes. One device can be compromised; two heterogeneous devices are unlikely to be compromised by the same hacker at the same time.\n\n* If your wallet looks a little different than it usually does, panic. You'll need to learn breathing exercises to panic properly without harming yourself too much. But the 1% chance you catch something malicious is worth the 99% of the time where a wallet software update changed things around a bit.\n\n* If your seed phrase has ever been typed into any device that physically has a wifi chip in it, your keys are compromised. Generate a new seed and transfer things.\n\n* Corollary: If you did something \"clever\" like write your seed phrase into a poem, it's still compromised. We're in the AI age now, so you have to protect your seed not only from malicious actors but from their smart AI bot armies who you have to assume will be combing through that poetry you wrote in 10th grade that's in that dropbox account you forgot about, trying random combinations of words in hopes that it derives an active private key.\n\n* If you have ever said your seed phrase out loud in earshot of a device that has a microphone and a wifi chip (cell phone, non-airgapped pc, smart tv...), your keys are compromised. Generate a new seed and transfer things.\n\n* If your seed phrase has ever been in view of any camera on any device, your keys are compromised. Generate a new seed and transfer things.\n\n* If your seed phrase ever looks at you a little cockeyed like he wants treats, but you already gave him his treats today, he's compromised and sadly you need to put him down.\n\n* If you do not know the specific method by which entropy was collected to generate your keys, your keys are compromised. The gold standard is to use physical dice to generate your seed phrase, and make sure you roll 'em around in your hands a lot. Bitcoin OGs remember Diceware.\n\n* If your ETH is wrapped in some way or another, you don't own ETH, you own an IOU for ETH. You are owed by a company and/or a contract. Companies go bankrupt, contracts get hacked. If you must hold IOUs, spread them out, but beware correlation risks that may be hiding themselves (ftx/celsius/blockfi/voyager/genesis/3ac is a great example of a hidden correlation risk).\n\n* You need to learn the basics of cryptography. Creating and managing keys without knowing cryptography basics is like trying to drive a car without knowing the rules of the road.\n\n* You need to learn the basics of computer security. Learn what makes hacking attempts successful. Learn what CTF is, and learn about the ways hackers and social engineers typically gain access to systems. Imagine you are a hacker with full pwned access to your own main daily driver computer, and imagine how you would try to steal your crypto.\n\n* Keep yourself up all night worrying about your wallet security. If you wanted to have a peaceful low-stress life, you should have gotten a government 9-5 instead of getting into crypto. If you really need some sleep, buy some melatonin and a weighted blanket. Don't fuck with Ambien - the government puts chips in the pills that program you to go get your seed phrase in the middle of the night and text it to the cia.\n\n* Don't fuck with Ledger.\n\n* Don't fuck with Binance.\n\n* If you are a regulatory agency, use 2-factor auth on your fucking twitter account.\n\nMy general paranoia has saved me several times since I started investing in crypto in the early 2010s. Remember, they ARE trying to get your keys. Always. You need to be perfect every time to win, they only need you to fuck up a single time to win, so the game is tilted in their favor. They will never stop, so you have to never stop defending.\n\n/u/hanniabu","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As we enter the early stages of the next bull market, please remember to keep your crypto wallet secure.

If it&#39;s a PC, it needs to be running a very mainstream very publicly-audited version of Linux like ubuntu, fedora, debian, etc. A hardware wallet counts as long as the design is open and the firmware is open-source, but it has some trade-offs you&#39;ll have to weigh for yourself.</p></li>\n<li><p>Do everything (concerning your main stack) in multiple batches. Everything. Even the most simple transfers from one address to another that seem like they would be impossible to fuck up, because trust me it&#39;s possible to fuck up - if not by your own accord, then by some tricky dicky scheme whereby a hacker replaces addresses in your computer&#39;s memory or uses some other silly scheme to bamboozle you. It&#39;ll be more expensive to batch things as far as transaction fees, but it&#39;s not possible for a single huge fuckup to ruin you. Nobody is perfect, but managing crypto demands perfection. If you send your entire stack off to some rando etherscan spoofer or directly to the token contract itself, there&#39;s no getting it back.</p></li>\n<li><p>When you&#39;re confirming an address, check it from two different devices running different OSes. One device can be compromised; two heterogeneous devices are unlikely to be compromised by the same hacker at the same time.</p></li>\n<li><p>If your wallet looks a little different than it usually does, panic. You&#39;ll need to learn breathing exercises to panic properly without harming yourself too much. But the 1% chance you catch something malicious is worth the 99% of the time where a wallet software update changed things around a bit.</p></li>\n<li><p>If your seed phrase has ever been typed into any device that physically has a wifi chip in it, your keys are compromised. Generate a new seed and transfer things.</p></li>\n<li><p>Corollary: If you did something &quot;clever&quot; like write your seed phrase into a poem, it&#39;s still compromised. We&#39;re in the AI age now, so you have to protect your seed not only from malicious actors but from their smart AI bot armies who you have to assume will be combing through that poetry you wrote in 10th grade that&#39;s in that dropbox account you forgot about, trying random combinations of words in hopes that it derives an active private key.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you have ever said your seed phrase out loud in earshot of a device that has a microphone and a wifi chip (cell phone, non-airgapped pc, smart tv...), your keys are compromised. Generate a new seed and transfer things.</p></li>\n<li><p>If your seed phrase has ever been in view of any camera on any device, your keys are compromised. Generate a new seed and transfer things.</p></li>\n<li><p>If your seed phrase ever looks at you a little cockeyed like he wants treats, but you already gave him his treats today, he&#39;s compromised and sadly you need to put him down.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you do not know the specific method by which entropy was collected to generate your keys, your keys are compromised. The gold standard is to use physical dice to generate your seed phrase, and make sure you roll &#39;em around in your hands a lot. Bitcoin OGs remember Diceware.</p></li>\n<li><p>If your ETH is wrapped in some way or another, you don&#39;t own ETH, you own an IOU for ETH. You are owed by a company and/or a contract. Companies go bankrupt, contracts get hacked. If you must hold IOUs, spread them out, but beware correlation risks that may be hiding themselves (ftx/celsius/blockfi/voyager/genesis/3ac is a great example of a hidden correlation risk).</p></li>\n<li><p>You need to learn the basics of cryptography. Creating and managing keys without knowing cryptography basics is like trying to drive a car without knowing the rules of the road.</p></li>\n<li><p>You need to learn the basics of computer security. Learn what makes hacking attempts successful. Learn what CTF is, and learn about the ways hackers and social engineers typically gain access to systems. Imagine you are a hacker with full pwned access to your own main daily driver computer, and imagine how you would try to steal your crypto.</p></li>\n<li><p>Keep yourself up all night worrying about your wallet security. If you wanted to have a peaceful low-stress life, you should have gotten a government 9-5 instead of getting into crypto. If you really need some sleep, buy some melatonin and a weighted blanket. Don&#39;t fuck with Ambien - the government puts chips in the pills that program you to go get your seed phrase in the middle of the night and text it to the cia.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don&#39;t fuck with Ledger.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don&#39;t fuck with Binance.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you are a regulatory agency, use 2-factor auth on your fucking twitter account.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My general paranoia has saved me several times since I started investing in crypto in the early 2010s. Remember, they ARE trying to get your keys. Always. You need to be perfect every time to win, they only need you to fuck up a single time to win, so the game is tilted in their favor. They will never stop, so you have to never stop defending.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/hanniabu\">/u/hanniabu</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-10 15:39:06","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kha9kp1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_193195q","parent_id":"t3_193195q","score":55,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/boodle_noodle","body":"tbh, I think I disagree with this sentiment for \\*most\\* people... \n\nIf you have $1m+ in a single wallet, then yes it is a target and should be treated as above. \n\nHowever, most people have wallets with maybe a few tens of thousands of dollars and the level of paranoia here is completely unhealthy.
