If Geth would make 80% (or whatever the dominance is) heavily slashed, there would be a huge layer 0 outcry, chain instability, and money lost by many big players. I think this would hit ETH&#39;s credibility very, very much, and the fallout would be hard to foresee (e.g. Lido or Coinbase using &quot;forked&quot; chain, large financial transactions on popular RPC gettgin rollbacked, etc). If super-majority client would ever go haywire, I think single percent slashing rewards would be the least of the concerns for a single person holding/staking ETH. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, we can fight that with client diversity, but as stated in my previous post, as long as it is not provable to be &quot;<strong>in my best interest</strong>&quot;, then the game theory takes on and Geth will continue to lead.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-01-21 22:34:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kj0ayl6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_19bwkm1","parent_id":"t1_kiy7epn","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":">\u00a0Why cant the swiftly move to another client\n\n\nYou're correct for scenario 1.

My point is that the way those bugs can play out in terms of finality is actually well-understood. The type of software failure that could cause multiple clients to accept the same buggy block without crashing is about as independent as a roll of two dice. This property is inherent to the nature of the specific types of bugs that can occur in software.\n\n> I don't want to speculate much on the consequences, but my understanding is that if we got as far as a slashing situation, that's basically a chain split / hard fork? Where the slashed victims remain unslashed on the invalid fork? Is that correct?\n\nSlashing happens in the consensus client, and is different than the inactivity leak due to invalid finalized chain that everyone is talking about.\n\nIf one client has a bug where it treats an invalid block as valid, there is a chain split. If other clients react properly to the same block, there will be two chain heads (if improperly, three, but that's unlikely and no more dangerous).\n\nThen, if 66% of stakers are using that buggy client, it finalizes the invalid fork. The finality gadget makes it so that those stakers can never attest to any other fork from then on without being slashed, notably they can never start attesting to the valid chain again.

My point is that the way those bugs can play out in terms of finality is actually well-understood. The type of software failure that could cause multiple clients to accept the same buggy block without crashing is about as independent as a roll of two dice. This property is inherent to the nature of the specific types of bugs that can occur in software.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t want to speculate much on the consequences, but my understanding is that if we got as far as a slashing situation, that&#39;s basically a chain split / hard fork? Where the slashed victims remain unslashed on the invalid fork? Is that correct?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Slashing happens in the consensus client, and is different than the inactivity leak due to invalid finalized chain that everyone is talking about.</p>\n\n<p>If one client has a bug where it treats an invalid block as valid, there is a chain split.
