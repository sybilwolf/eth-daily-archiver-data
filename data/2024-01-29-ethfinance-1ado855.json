A system that relies on massive redundant computation for consensus will have to compensate too much per unit work done to be economically effective in the long run (looking at you Bitcoin).\n\nIn my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18luu66/daily_general_discussion_december_19_2023/ke2fw3x/?context=3) I talked about GenSyn which swapped out useless hashing for useful model training and the economic potential of such a solution. AI training just happens to be a task that meets all these criteria. There is basically infinite demand for AI training. I can think of a few other tasks such as protein folding (folding at home) or private key cracking but most computational tasks don't meet these criteria and even some of those that do wouldn't have much economic value. As such, while Gensyn seemed to have a neat idea, it didn't seem to be a paradigm shift so much as a cool footnote in history. *However*, what happens if we relax requirement 3 a bit and allow for subjective consensus?\n\n\"But Logris, what the hell is subjective consensus?\" Glad you asked! Basically it's group think for deciding on things with no objective answer. The most common example of this is every oracle you've ever known. Smart contracts can only refer to chain state. They can't see BTC price feeds on Kraken for example. All data that is off-chain is subjective from the perspective of the chain. Consensus on that data is decided subjectively by oracles. But not all oracles work alike. Chainlink is optimized for a small number of data streams with high liveness. UMA is optimized for the long-tail of queries with latency that can be measured in days.\n\nThe interesting part about UMA in my opinion is they apply a commit-reveal scheme and use stake to keep people honest. All participants submit their data in an encrypted way before a deadline, then submit the decryption keys for that data after the deadline when no answer can be changed. The do something like average the result and people with answers too far from the mean lose some of their stake. The obvious Schelling point for a submission is *the truth*. Expecting the average to be anything but that requires a conspiracy of submitters to distort the data. Unless you believe such a conspiracy exists, the rational answer to submit is the truest one you can find. All you're really doing is measuring what *you believe* everyone else *will believe*, but in practice this works well when there is an *objective* answer rather than something either unknown or disputed. You could imagine how this could be used for anything: \"Did Trump lose the 2020 election?\". I expect you'd get a very different answer if you shoved that question through this system than if you polled the average US voter. Honestly, I expect you'd get a better one.\n\nSo what would happen if you applied something like UMA consensus to a PoW blockchain? Addressing the points above in order.\n\n1) You would still need a stream of continuous work for miners to do. Either that work has to be submitted by validators or it needs to be self-evident to miners. Nothing here says the work has to actually be useful, just eventually verifiable.\n\n2) You still need permissionless mining but if the work isn't self-evident the network may need some type of sampling to throttle the participants which means you'll need miner stake for Sybil resistance.\n\n3) Validation would still be permissionless but validators would definitely need stake for subjective consensus to function.\n\n4) This is basically unchanged but I will note that nothing says payouts in a blockchain have to be immediate. It's totally fine if people receive their payout a couple days later. That said, you want consensus to happen continuously so you probably want each participant running a program rather than manually voting.\n\nWhat types of tasks could you now do that you previously couldn't have? In order of least to highest villainy:\n\n1) Miners provide DePIn resources like data availability; Validators validate using data sampling.\n\n2) Miners submit a predictive price of the S&P 500 for the next day; Validators grade it retroactively. If this ever gets competitive it will distort global markets as large players buy and sell to make their predictions come true.\n\nIf you're willing to have the validators create synthetic work to fill in any gaps as well:\n\n3) Break web2 Sybil resistance. Full multi-model media. Solve Captchas for bots so they can break into accounts easier. Create fake videos and images for KYC for identity thieves. Create explicit photos of Taylor Swift and distribute them on a data availability layer. Create Fake news for Russia to destroy democracies. Entirely peer to peer and anonymously. Destroy society as we know it.\n\n\"But Logris, who would create such an evil thing?\" Glad you asked! Before you say this is far-fetched and sounds terrible, this is *in principle* the concept of [BitTensor](https://flagship.fyi/outposts/ai-crypto/exploring-bittensors-new-subnets-a-deep-dive/). So, uh, this is *happening today* and the payouts right now are about $25M a day.

Either that work has to be submitted by validators or it needs to be self-evident to miners. Nothing here says the work has to actually be useful, just eventually verifiable.</p>\n\n<p>2) You still need permissionless mining but if the work isn&#39;t self-evident the network may need some type of sampling to throttle the participants which means you&#39;ll need miner stake for Sybil resistance.</p>\n\n<p>3) Validation would still be permissionless but validators would definitely need stake for subjective consensus to function.</p>\n\n<p>4) This is basically unchanged but I will note that nothing says payouts in a blockchain have to be immediate. It&#39;s totally fine if people receive their payout a couple days later. That said, you want consensus to happen continuously so you probably want each participant running a program rather than manually voting.</p>\n\n<p>What types of tasks could you now do that you previously couldn&#39;t have? In order of least to highest villainy:</p>\n\n<p>1) Miners provide DePIn resources like data availability; Validators validate using data sampling.</p>\n\n<p>2) Miners submit a predictive price of the S&amp;P 500 for the next day; Validators grade it retroactively. If this ever gets competitive it will distort global markets as large players buy and sell to make their predictions come true.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re willing to have the validators create synthetic work to fill in any gaps as well:</p>\n\n<p>3) Break web2 Sybil resistance. Full multi-model media. Solve Captchas for bots so they can break into accounts easier. Create fake videos and images for KYC for identity thieves. Create explicit photos of Taylor Swift and distribute them on a data availability layer. Create Fake news for Russia to destroy democracies. Entirely peer to peer and anonymously. Destroy society as we know it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But Logris, who would create such an evil thing?&quot; Glad you asked!
