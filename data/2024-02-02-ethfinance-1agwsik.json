Please keep in mind that I am also writing this to structure my thoughts, but am not an expert at all, so things here might be wrong. If you spot mistakes, please correct them! \n\n*What is the general idea of restaking?*\n\nRestaking means that we use capital that is staked to secure Ethereum - both staked ETH in validators but also via LSTs - and *also* use it to secure something else (and something else). \n\n*What kind of things can be secured by restaking?*\n\nBasically anything. It could be an oracle. A data availability solution. An L2/ appchain. Anything that needs security.  \n\n*Why is this needed?* \n\nBootstrapping security for a new protocol is hard, especially if you want the validator set to be decentralized. Eigenlayer wants to be \"a marketplace for trust\". On this marketplace protocols that need trust/ security can tap into the already existing staked capital that Ethereum offers and build on that. Eigenlayer's thesis is that this is way easier than building it on your own. Their argument also builds on web2: Why have your own servers/ authentication etc. when you can just build in the cloud (e.g. AWS) or use Auth0 etc. = existing solutions that allow you to focus on your core product. \n\nImportant: the existing solution is **not** Eigenlayer, but the security offered by stakers / holders of LSTs. \n\n*So how does this marketplace = Eigenlayer work?*\n\nNew protocols that want to build on Eigenlayer basically define what kind of trust/ security they need. This comes down to: Do they want only solo / home stakers to secure their network? Or are LSTs okay as well? \n\nAt the same time they define what they are willing to offer for that service: How much are they willing to pay for securing their network? This could be in ETH, their native token etc. \n\nAlso they of course define what the restakers have to do to secure the network. This means they provide a software/ client that the restakers have to run to secure the protocol. This is similar to what stakers run with execution and consensus clients to secure Ethereum. All these are called \"AVSs\". Actively validated services. Actively. Someone needs to do an action. \n\nRestakers start by either creating an Eigenpod or by depositing LSTs. An Eigenpod is a smart contract that a validator points to. So if a validator wants to exit the beaconchain, the ETH goes to the Eigenpod first. Similarly by depositing LSTs into Eigenlayer you deposit it into a smart contract. If the restaker wants to exit Eigenlayer there is a 7 day period before they can finally really withdraw their assets. \n\nThis means that the assets don't leave the validator or the Eigenlayer smart contract. The secured protocol does **not** control the assets. \n\nAfter depositing restakers then opt-in if they are willing to secure the new protocol. They accept the offer made by the protocol, run the client and secure the network and are paid for this service according to the terms. \n\nThere will also be operators that run the clients for you. So the restaker deposits, but delegates the actual management of the clients to a 3rd party. In that case you obviously *trust* someone else to do the job of securing correctly. Just like you do with LSTs or dPoS in other ecosystems. These operators of course ask for a fee to do that. \n\nIf they behave according to the protocols rules (= they secure the protocol as intended) they are paid. If they misbehave (=they attack the protocol they are supposed to secure) they can be slashed just like someone could be slashed on the beaconchain. \n\nSo how does the slashing work now? If they are caught, the protocol can ask Eigenlayer to slash the restaker. Eigenlayer right now has a \"slashing committee\" (my term, don't know if that's the real name of it). This committee basically checks if the restaker really misbehaved and if the slashing request is fair. So right now a protocol can't just slash you as a restaker, there is a (centralized!) security mechanism in place. \n\nIf the restaker indeed attacked the network, they can't withdraw their LSTs and the LSTs are slashed. If they have a validator right now (!) no one can force them to exit the validator, so they can continue validating Ethereum. But when they want to exit, they will withdraw to the eigenpod and then the Eigenlayer protocol can slash the portion that is supposed to be slashed before the restaker can withdraw the rest. \n\nI don't know what happens to the assets that are being slashed. Maybe someone can add that? Are those burned? Going to the protocol that did the slashing? (That would be a strange incentive, but maybe that's the case)\n\n*So where does the yield come from?*\n\nFirst of all: There is **no** **yield** by just depositing. Only if you start securing one (or more) protocols, you will receive yield. This also means that right now there is only smart contract risk, no slashing etc. \n\nThis yield is what these protocols offer to restakers for their service securing the new protocol. It can be paid in different tokens (or a mix). Could be new issuance. Could be from their treasury. Could be part of the fees they make with the product running on top. \n\n\\---\n\nBut Benido, this all sounds great, I was told Eigenlayer is a huge risk, I don't get it, that is like risk free yield on top of risk free yield?\n\nIf you were around in spring of 2022, you might remember 3AC (Three Arrows Capital). They were long when the market was going down and at one point lending firms ask for more capital from 3AC. What did 3AC do? They used the same collateral over and over again. So what happened? All lending firms found out that the collateral they thought they could liquidate (\"slash\") was posted as collateral with other lenders as well. 3AC basically \"restaked\" the same collateral over and over again. No lending firm could liquidate the collateral and they all went tits up, the whole market crashed and it was a dark time... \n\nOf course this was off chain and Eigenlayer is onchain. With restaking we *know* how many times a certain asset is used to secure a certain protocol. But in the end something similar could happen. Deposit asset X once, attack several protocols and all protocols find out that they can't slash, because it was slashed already. \n\nOn top we could see borrowing and lending protocols that allow LRTs (Liquid Restaking Tokens) to be deposited. So an attacker could even borrow against it to acquire more and attack cheaply... \n\nUsing the same collateral several times is something that can be abused. Yes, it's onchain, so more transparent, but that doesn't make it bullet proof. We will witness attacks. This might lead to a cascade of liquidations and could take down so many protocols... and always remember: These assets started as stake to secure Ethereum, in a worst case scenario ETH's security might be diminished and attacks might be possible in ways we can't even imagine today. \n\n\\---\n\nI hope this explains restaking, but it might just be more confusing because I am missing things, the structure sucks etc., I don't know.

The main thing is your debt to the protocol will be denominated in alETH which is loosely pegged to ETH (trades at a significant discount since the main liquidity pool was hacked). This means you will have to repay your loan in alETH. So if you take out a loan from the protocol and sell it into stables/cash, you are effectively shorting alETH, which the protocol works to keep pegged to ETH, so if protocol is working/not getting hacked you are shorting ETH. \n\nSo if your debt costs $10k today @ $2300 per ETH, and ETH goes to $4k, the price to rebuy alETH and repay your loan is now $17.4K. So have to consider that. This goes the other way too if you take out the loan and sell to stables @ $4k and repurchase at $2.3k. Otherwise you can let it pay itself off over like 15 years at current rates. Then you are also making a long term bet on the viability of the protocol. You can liquidate collateral to pay off remaining debt at any time, but this is like market selling your ETH w/ same tax implications. You can also just leave rETH parked there and take out the amount of your debt repaid each time the protocol harvests as additional alETH debt and just use that as income or compound it in other ETH or alETH strategies to shorten repayment time (when protocol harvests, part of your debt is forgiven, you can take out additional alETH debt against your collateral to bring LTV back up to max 50%). This can improve capital efficiency but comes with higher risk, tax implications, and gas costs. The attractiveness of some of those strategies will prob be dependent on your cost basis/tax implications, how much you're working with to make it worth the gas costs, and definitely on your risk appetite and how hands on you want to be with it, but yeah get well acquainted with the risks and tax implications including debt repayment income before jumping in. \n\nOne more thing. When you deposit LSTs, the protocol tracks the value in ETH. So if you deposit like 1 rETH, just as an example let's say that's worth 1.3ETH today, in the future when you pay off your debt and go to withdraw  1rETH = 1.6ETH so the protocol will give you less than 1 rETH back but the same exact 1.3ETH denominated value that you deposited.
