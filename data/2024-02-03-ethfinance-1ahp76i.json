I&#39;m really beginning to worry that we (the broader Ethereum community) aren&#39;t delivering on our vision and sticking to our values and are destined to create the next generation ecosystem after what Gen X left us with Web 1.0 and 2.0. Sure, good things will come from Ethereum and the projects which stick to core values but I don&#39;t think most projects are doing that and most people aren&#39;t adopting the more value aligned projects. Much like Web 1.0 and 2.0, there are great protocols for individual freedoms and rights like PGP email, and open source products like Linux and Signal. But most people don&#39;t use any of these since big tech spyware is handed to them on a plate. Crypto projects are basically the same. For every Gitcoin there&#39;s a hundred Bored Apes like projects or worse. Are we becoming like every generation before us? Inventing something new, something amazing for many people, only to lose it to opportunistic capitalists and a whitewashed product for the masses? Why would we really be the exception to the rule? Fuck man...</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I now realise that <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1agwsik/daily_general_discussion_february_2_2024/kolc1q9/\">the Uniswap thing may have been a mistake</a> but I&#39;ve still been feeling this general sentiment more and more lately. I also don&#39;t mean it to be too doomer. We&#39;re still doing a lot of really awesome stuff. I guess I&#39;m just not as naive as I once was about what we might actually achieve in the long run.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-03 02:22:11","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-02-03 02:50:17","id":"kopy3kh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ahp76i","parent_id":"t3_1ahp76i","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Beef_Lamborghinion","body":"There are projects fighting for a better DeFi and supporting dapps that follow the original DeFi ethos, like The DeFi Collective.
