So what gives? Well, I still stand by the above. EigenLayer is building out their platform still and I think that points are a long way away from being turned into anything meaningful like a token. But what I missed was EtherFi points.\n\n**As a really quick overview for those who have no clue about YT-eETH and Pendle, a super quick, not 100% accurate TL;DR is as follows:**\n\n>YTeETH is a token representing the points and staking yield accrued by an underlying eETH token. But since everyone right now is happily depositing eETH to Pendle for 15-30% APR paid out in ETH in exchange for forgoing points, there aren't many people buying the points token meaning you currently get 10x more points than the amount of eETH you deposit, which is muiltiplied by EtherFi's double points for eETH in DeFi apps. So hence 0.1 ETH yields the points of 1.5-3ETH. The catch is you don't get the original 0.1 eETH deposit back as that goes to the folks earning 15-30%APR. ^(Someone please correct me if my understanding is wrong in any significant way, but that should cover the gist of it.)\n\nI created a spreadsheet predicting the value of the confirmed EtherFi airdrop. Their roadmap has it set for April of this year, so assuming no delays there, there is 50-80 days more points to be printed before a token or snapshot. However, one of their badges denotes significance to the 1st of April, so that date might be significant.\n\nAnyway, here are my assumptions in the spreadsheet:\n\n- Fully Diluted Market Cap: $300M - $5B\n\n- % Share of FDV being Airdropped: 5 - 15%\n\n- Points in circulation (currently ~9B increasing 350-500M/day): 24B - 60B\n\n- Small account multiplier (are points 1:1 or do whales get less of a drop?): 1 - 3\n\n- Unclaimed token multiplier (how many people don't claim and do unclaimed tokens get distributed to claimers?): 1 - 2.5\n\nI also have a calculation for the points one can expect to earn by buying YT-eETH at the current rate on Pendle.\n\nI understand that there is smart contract risk and risk of points not being used for a token but I am not including this in my calculations aside from considering that there's maybe a 10-20% chance of losing what I put in to these risks. Plus, EtherFi would lose a hell of a lot of reputation if they don't deliver on their points system. Besides, I feel like this risk is approximately balanced out by the potential upside of EigenLayer points ever actually being worth something (which I am not counting on).\n\n**So what sort of ROI does this produce?**\n\n**Super Bear: -85%** - *Oof*. However, I cannot see all of these stats being at their most bearish. Even just putting on a mild small account multiplier of 2.5x and an unclaimed multiplier of 2x then you're already talking about getting most of your money back plus Eigen points.\n\n**Super Bull: 11,500% ROI** - So 0.1 ETH buys ~1.5 YT-eETH on Arbitrum right now which would result in about 150,000 points by April 1st. The insane 15% allocation of total supply to the drop and $4B valuation would leave points sitting at 2.5\u00a2 each which would leave you sitting on ***a $28K airdrop***. For a $240 investment in a token which literally goes to zero by the time of the airdrop. But that's enough hopium. I hate to break it to you but the stars won't align and reality will likely be somewhere between these two possibilities.\n\n**Realistic Bear:**\n\n*Scenario: Points keep getting printed at a faster and faster rate, FDV is low since EtherFi by launch might have about $1B TVL and compare Lido's 23B TVL to their $2.5B LDO token. But let's be realistic, EtherFi has restaking hype which Lido doesn't, plus it's the new kid on the block, so I think a $400M valuation is fair. Points get printed faster and faster so based on current platform growth and current issuance, 4x the current supply in 50-80 days seems conservative/slightly bearish (so 36B points). Small account multiplier is 1 (points are 1:1) since after all, points are representative of the rules of distribution. Unclaimed token multiplier of 1.6 and a 10% share of supply for the airdrop as they seem to be approximately middle ground for most tokens. I could go more bearish but this isn't the super bear option, so remember that not everything will play out against us.*\n\n**Result: 11% ROI** - Respectable for a bearish scenario.\n\n**Realistic Bull:**\n\n*Scenario: Points keep inflating at the current rate with a slight bit of acceleration as TVL grows so supply of 27B. FDV of $1B - after all, if an L2 coming out of nowhere riding on restaking hype ($ALT) hits $3B, then one third of that for an LRT with a TVL of likely to be above $1B at minimum isn't too much of a stretch for a bull case IMO. Furthermore, Pendle's FDV is ~80% of its TVL. Small account multiplier 1.5 - a bit conservative on this one. For example, with Tornado cash it was up to ~4x but again, this isn't the super bull case. Same goes for unclaimed token multiplier which is staying at 1.6 for the same reason.*\n\n**Result: ~560% ROI** - A $1,600 airdrop for a $240 investment (0.1 ETH) where the original amount is lost. For reference, if you went the route of buying the eETH directly instead of using the much riskier YT-eETH, you'd need 15-30x more ETH to get an airdrop of this size if you deposited today and held until April. $1,600 for a 1.5 ETH ($3,600) investment is not really all that surprising for an airdrop these days.\n\n**Medium case:** I won't do the calculations again, so let's just go in between the two realistic cases. **250% ROI** - That's roughly where my average case is sitting here for a super high risk degen play.\n\n---------------------\n\n#TL;DR/Closing Remarks:\n\nIn my humble option, based on extremely approximate napkin math, there is a good opportunity here for those with a high risk appetite. Personally, I will be keeping this to my degen stack which is ***less than 2% of my total HODL stack.*** I will be splitting this strategy between 3 wallets to maximise my luck on the small holder multiplier implemented by some airdrops (shoutout u/cryptomoon2020) but I also won't be sybil-ing the shit out of it with just 3 wallets. If you go with this strategy, be prepared to lose it all. Pendle is quite high up the DeFi legos tower and relatively new so there is significant smart contract risk. Furthermore, remember that points are in no way an investment contract (they're not securities!) So they might literally be worth nothing or maybe redeemable for low effort merch one day.\n\nAnyway, I look forward to getting some feedback. Remember this is super approximate napkin math and the idea is that not a single one of these factors is predictable, but you can estimate reasonable ranges and if you average all of the ranges, then there's a mild chance that you get a ball-park estimate. My experience with this method is that it is rarely out by more than a factor of 10 which is usually enough to figure out if it's worth doing or not.\n\nBut finally, this is **definitely not financial advice** and I'd like to remind you I'm doing this with a tiny portion of my stack for a bit of fun and hopefully a + net probable value gamble.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/396/558/eb7.png\">Just bought some YT-eETH.</a></p>\n\n<p>Ok but really, just yesterday I was telling someone that I think the idea of buying EigenLayer points and losing your principal investment is a bad idea.

But let&#39;s be realistic, EtherFi has restaking hype which Lido doesn&#39;t, plus it&#39;s the new kid on the block, so I think a $400M valuation is fair. Points get printed faster and faster so based on current platform growth and current issuance, 4x the current supply in 50-80 days seems conservative/slightly bearish (so 36B points). Small account multiplier is 1 (points are 1:1) since after all, points are representative of the rules of distribution. Unclaimed token multiplier of 1.6 and a 10% share of supply for the airdrop as they seem to be approximately middle ground for most tokens. I could go more bearish but this isn&#39;t the super bear option, so remember that not everything will play out against us.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Result: 11% ROI</strong> - Respectable for a bearish scenario.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Realistic Bull:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Scenario: Points keep inflating at the current rate with a slight bit of acceleration as TVL grows so supply of 27B. FDV of $1B - after all, if an L2 coming out of nowhere riding on restaking hype ($ALT) hits $3B, then one third of that for an LRT with a TVL of likely to be above $1B at minimum isn&#39;t too much of a stretch for a bull case IMO. Furthermore, Pendle&#39;s FDV is ~80% of its TVL. Small account multiplier 1.5 - a bit conservative on this one. For example, with Tornado cash it was up to ~4x but again, this isn&#39;t the super bull case. Same goes for unclaimed token multiplier which is staying at 1.6 for the same reason.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Result: ~560% ROI</strong> - A $1,600 airdrop for a $240 investment (0.1 ETH) where the original amount is lost. For reference, if you went the route of buying the eETH directly instead of using the much riskier YT-eETH, you&#39;d need 15-30x more ETH to get an airdrop of this size if you deposited today and held until April. $1,600 for a 1.5 ETH ($3,600) investment is not really all that surprising for an airdrop these days.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Medium case:</strong> I won&#39;t do the calculations again, so let&#39;s just go in between the two realistic cases. <strong>250% ROI</strong> - That&#39;s roughly where my average case is sitting here for a super high risk degen play.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>TL;DR/Closing Remarks:</h1>\n\n<p>In my humble option, based on extremely approximate napkin math, there is a good opportunity here for those with a high risk appetite. Personally, I will be keeping this to my degen stack which is <strong><em>less than 2% of my total HODL stack.</em></strong> I will be splitting this strategy between 3 wallets to maximise my luck on the small holder multiplier implemented by some airdrops (shoutout <a href=\"/u/cryptomoon2020\">u/cryptomoon2020</a>) but I also won&#39;t be sybil-ing the shit out of it with just 3 wallets. If you go with this strategy, be prepared to lose it all. Pendle is quite high up the DeFi legos tower and relatively new so there is significant smart contract risk. Furthermore, remember that points are in no way an investment contract (they&#39;re not securities!) So they might literally be worth nothing or maybe redeemable for low effort merch one day.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I look forward to getting some feedback. Remember this is super approximate napkin math and the idea is that not a single one of these factors is predictable, but you can estimate reasonable ranges and if you average all of the ranges, then there&#39;s a mild chance that you get a ball-park estimate. My experience with this method is that it is rarely out by more than a factor of 10 which is usually enough to figure out if it&#39;s worth doing or not.</p>\n\n<p>But finally, this is <strong>definitely not financial advice</strong> and I&#39;d like to remind you I&#39;m doing this with a tiny portion of my stack for a bit of fun and hopefully a + net probable value gamble.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-07 23:59:35","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-02-08 03:51:28","id":"kpgh9f3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1alov71","parent_id":"t3_1alov71","score":42,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/labrav","body":"Thanks for the thorough write-up.

The criticisms levied at Ethereum Proof of Stake, and minimum ETH balance requirements for solo staking are usually from the same people who ignore just how unfair, weighted to the wealthy, and undemocratic other chain security mechanisms are.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-08 07:37:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kphv0wp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1alov71","parent_id":"t1_kpht0tr","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/LogrisTheBard","body":"The goal of the blockchain is equal opportunity of access, not equal results.
