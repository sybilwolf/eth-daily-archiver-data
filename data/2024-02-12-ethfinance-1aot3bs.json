In a best case scenario this fragmentation wouldn't exist at all or at least be abstracted away.\n\nThis seems to be possible according to Justin Drake. How? L1 validators also acting as (shared) sequencers for (all) L2s. This allows all layers to work together, guarantee \"pre confirmations\" and settlement in the next possible block, which in the end leads to composability in the whole ecosystem.\n\nHow? Justin explains everything in detail over two hours and trust me... it will make you bullish!

Chris Goes is a great guest. He is one of the devs of IBC and has been one of the first to talk about intents. I love how calm he is when he answers (and how he starts every response with something like \"right\").\n\nYou will learn about intents, why Chris thinks they are important and how they might (!) reshape the power within the crypto markets. From my point of view there are two fascinating points he makes in the interview:\n\n\\- the unbundling of asset and blockchain\n\n\\- How intents put the user into power\n\nThe unbundling has been discussed in some podcasts and context, e.g. with eigenlayer (Ethereum exporting their security via staked ETH to other chains).

Transitioning between wallets is a breeze, requiring only the respective password inputs. This feature amplifies the device\u2019s adaptability and user-friendly nature. Additionally, it also enables users to easily create a new wallet for multi-signature transactions without the need for an extra hardware wallet.
