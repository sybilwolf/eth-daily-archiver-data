It's pretty damn exciting.\n\nVal starts by stating the motivations for the changes. In all honesty, the real reason is that Lido's community staking module scared the hell out of the Rocket Pool community, and it really forced the community into action. Saying that, he has three specific interests he focuses on 1) Making RP node operation more profitable compared to rivals, 2) attracting more rETH minting, and 3) adding value streams to the RPL token.\n\nThe main thrust of his proposal is a new way of setting up validators with Rocket Pool. Because of changes to how nodes will be recognized in an upcoming upgrade, we'll be able to use much less eth as collateral than we currently do. You might have heard of megapools. This builds on that idea. **Val suggests the first two validators will require 4 eth bonds and bonds after those will require only 1.5 eth of collateral**. A node operator with 100 eth now can make 12 validators. That same NO will be able to spin up 64 validators! This will make node operator restrictions, like we are experiencing right now, a thing of the past. Even if Rocket Pool does not add a single new node operator, we'll be able to mint up to 5m rETH with the node operators we already have. \n\nThe biggest change that Val envisions is a fundamental change in the way validators are collateralized. Right now, you have to use ETH and RPL together to stake with minimum levels of RPL collateral. The new system will separate these requirements to make it all optional. **You'll be able to stake eth only, eth and rpl together (for the most rewards), or rpl alone**. This opens up the market for people to come to Rocket Pool in a way that suits them. As a NO, you'll have the choice to stake with eth only or with eth and rpl. As an RPL holder, you'll be able to throw your RPL into a vault and earn rewards. \n\nSo, what's the benefit of this new system? **You'll get massively improved awards compared to now**. Because we will have LEB1.5s, the rewards will be earned on 30.5 eth of rETH commission. That commission will be divided in new ways between the three different staking types. Val shows that each cohort could earn more rewards than they would staking with Lido's CSM. On top of that, if we attract a lot of eth-only node operators, the rewards to RPL stakers will be massively amplified - Val shows sample staker distributions to show what it will look like - and it looks VERY good for RPL holders.  A solo-staker who moves to Rocket Pool could earn double their income without needing a single token of RPL!\n\n**The breaking of the requirement of RPL as a collateral tokens opens up the doors for it being a \"fee switch on\" token**. What does this fee switch turned on look like? The commission paid by rETH holders will be given, in part, to RPL stakers. RPL will be a token that you can stake and get pure eth rewards. You'll also be able to get access to any potential upside (or suffer downside) in the token's value accrual against ETH. The market yesterday for the Uni token performed the way it did based on the fee switch turning on giving a 1% return for holding the Uni token holders. RPL will potentially give a much better return if more node operators decide to stake with eth only. This is one of the most bullish catalysts I can think of in Val's system relating to the RPL token.\n\nVal briefly explains some supporting upgrades that will have to happen at the same time as these validator changes. These include a new commission system that adjusts based on what the protocol needs, the new megapool contract system it is all based upon that allows node operator level collateral, and the need for forced exits at the ethereum protocol level. Because of the last fact, this system will not come into force until the Petra upgrade on Ethereum. Getting everything ready now, means we should be ready to go as soon as the Petra hard fork happens. He goes into much more detail on all these changes in explanation documents he links to at the end of his proposal.\n\nWe're still in the process of figuring things out, but this is an amazingly exciting time for Rocket Pool. If you have questions or want to contribute to these changes, come by the Rocket Pool discord and join the discussion. If you're coming to EthDenver, we'll have sessions on the Saturday afternoon at the Denver Lift-Off event (Rocket Pool's first dedicated conference) where we'll brainstorm the various visions. There will be presentations on these changes during Sunday's sessions. I expect the community to leave Denver with 2 or 3 cohesive plans we can work on and then vote on in the next couple of months. \n\nI've never been as bullish on Rocket Pool as I am now.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I come with news from Rocket Pool land.</p>\n\n<p>Valdorff, one of our community gigabrains has <a href=\"https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/blob/2024-02_strategy/2024_02_strategy/readme.md\">released his version</a> of what he thinks the overhaul of the Rocket Pool tokenomics should look like.
