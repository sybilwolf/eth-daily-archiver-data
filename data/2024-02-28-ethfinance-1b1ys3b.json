Annnnnnd I\u00a0held through all of it and didn't take much in profits, because I am a true belETHer.\u00a0\n\n\nI ended up regretting it, as I had to capitulate and sell half my stack at a much lower price later on. The cherry on top is I also sold my BTC for more ETH, which caused me to realize capital gains, which resulted in me having to sell more ETH to cover the costs, which also caused more capital gains \ud83d\udc80. I also sold my ENS airdrop at 25% of original value.\n\n\nNowadays, my ETH stack is roughly a third of what I originally had, and I don't want to let go of any of it. Basically breaking some major rules of investing, not having a plan and being married to my bags and whatnot.\n\n\nThe bright side is, I *think* I am much more savvy now, and I have somewhat of a plan. In the end, despite the promising potential of the tech, I think the tech adoption we hope for is still much, much, further away timewise than we like to think. The main difference this cycle is the existence of spot ETFs, which is a wild card, and makes things even harder to predict. If a spot ETH ETF is approved, it will likely pump ETH. But what happens after the crypto market bubble bursts? Back to original ETF approval prices or do we go back to previous lows before the BTC ETF was approved?

Historical state is generally inaccessible to the EVM, and while you can unroll block headers and Patricia-Merkle tries, that's gas heavy with increasing cost for earlier state. So Relic Protocol builds a single merkle tree over historical state to allow for efficient proofs. Simple use cases are on-chain verification for airdrops and snapshot voting.\n* [Victor Sanchez Belmar of Kinto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ0H1EWsdhI) explained their Arbitrum-based L2, Kinto. Their worry is that applications that need KYC would either be stuck on a private chain isolated from the rest of the world, or would live on Eth L1 but with a million different KYC systems that aren't compatible with one another. So Kinto requires users to pass KYC before they can do *anything* at all. But once you're in, you get your smart contract wallet, and you're in. Full EVM chain where each dapp can easily check that \"this user lives in this country and isn't sanctioned\" but otherwise allows for full composability.\n* [Junda Liu of Brevis.Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhigzdQ0BMc) had a good complementary talk to the one about Relic Protocol, but a little more broad. They see that there are a *lot* of types of computation that the EVM isn't good at, and they propose to use a complementary \"ZK coprocessor\". Basically, you have some task that can't be done efficiently in the EVM (e.g. historical state access), so you write a circuit on Brevis, call it from Ethereum, and once the computation is done, they'll call a function on your smart contract to pass the results and a zk proof back. Nitpick: isn't the selling point here the SNARKs, not the ZK?\n* [Shannon Wells of Livepeer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMtAe2s5iR8) is hopping on the AI hype train. Livepeer is a decentralized compute network for video transcoding, with fee incentivization. But recently they've been thinking about how to generalize their compute for additional tasks in v2, primarily generative AI video. Still in development. They're thinking about how to build tools for content authenticity, verifiable compute, and on-chain ownership of AI models.\n* [Billy Campana of API3 DAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuoK65w1rj4) is capturing MEV created by oracle updates: OEV. Primarily liquidations of undercollateralized positions. Right now that MEV opportunity would be indirectly auctioned off through MEV-Boost. But with OEV Network (a ZK rollup), oracles can auction off the right to extract OEV from their updates, searchers bid on it, and in the end the oracle gets the value (and the dapp using that oracle gets a small cut too). It's been suggested that more and more MEV will shift to being captured by users and dapps, with less flowing to proposers, and I wonder if this is an indicator of that occurring.\n* [Michael Moser of Chorus One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_lRelJSslk) talked about thier research on validator timing games in MEV. I had seen this work before on [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-cost-of-artificial-latency-in-the-pbs-context/17847). They generally found that yes, delaying your getHeader call increases the amount you earn from your block proposal. Simultaneously, it's zero-sum: the proposer after you gets less. Another effect is increased variance, which harms smaller node operators more as it takes more time for rewards to converge to the mean.\n* [Suji Yan of Mask Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_LgrIwPW5Y) gave a kind of meandering talk broadly about \"decentralized social revolution\". He referenced John Perry Barlow's [A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_Cyberspace), compared modern internet giants like Google and Facebook to the East India Company, said that once AI earns the right to freedom of speech it's going to want to use web3 tech, among other things.
