I figured I\u2019d share them here and also ask anyone to check my thinking. \n\nFinalization is not some magic 2/3 number, where an *almost* finalized block just needs to get over that hump of 2/3 of the validators attesting to it and then it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s just a line that we\u2019ve chosen to define and say \u201chere\u2019s a good bar to meet and we can say the block is \u201cfinalized.\u201d \n\nSo what is it and why does it matter?\n\nThe beacon chain chooses one validator at random to propose a block in each 12-second slot of the blockchain. That validator is the only one who can propose a block, and they can only propose one block. If they propose more than one block for the same slot, they get slashed and force-exited as a validator.\n\nThe interesting thing to note here is that an Ethereum block reorg only has two possible outcomes: the proposed block or an empty block. That differs from Bitcoin, in which reorged blocks contain different transactions and were proposed by different miners. \n\nAnyway\u2026blocks are only validated by a fraction of the existing validators, as each validator only attests to 1 out of every 32 blocks. This is a way to keep Ethereum nimble, as requiring each validator to attest to each block would bog down the network. \n\nHowever, at the end of every 32 block section (32 blocks is an \u201cepoch\u201d), there is a block called a \u201ccheckpoint.\u201d When a validator casts their 1-out-of-every-32 blocks vote, they also cast a vote attesting to the last checkpoint. When a checkpoint garners attestations from 2/3 of all validators in existence, that checkpoint (and every block before it) is considered \u201cjustified.\u201d \n\nAnd when two checkpoints in a row are justified (which naturally takes at minimum of two epochs or 12.8 minutes), the oldest of the two justified blocks is considered \u201cfinalized\u201d along with every block that preceded it. \n\nSo why is this important? Because of the double vote slashing offense. \n\nEach validator can only vote one way per block. They can\u2019t change their vote, or a double vote slashing occurs. When a validator is slashed, they lose around .5 eth and are forced-exited after a certain amount of delayed time. This time delay allows the protocol to see who else is being penalized around the same time period. If there are many slashing offenses, the protocol assumes they were colluding to attack the network, and the slashing offenses start to get angry and impose an additional penalty. It\u2019s important  to understand the formula for this additional penalty. It\u2019s:\n\nvalidator_balance * 3 * fraction_of_validators_slashed\n\nIn other words, if you\u2019re the only offender, your additional penalty is negligible. However, if at least 1/3 of the other validators were also slashed around the same time, you lose *all of your stake*. (This is one reason that it\u2019s so stupid to be running a super majority client, but I digress).\n\nSo let\u2019s look at this in terms of a justified block. Most conservative case: \n\nA block is justified because exactly 2/3 validators have attested to it (and the other 1/3 haven\u2019t voted yet). In order to get reorged, 2/3 + 1 validators need to attest to a different block in that slot. We\u2019ll, 1/3 of validators are still free to vote, but to get the other 1/3 + 1 validators, 1/3 + 1 of all total validators will need to cast a second vote. They can do this, but they\u2019ll get slashed. And a quick look at our handy formula above tells you this will result in a total slashing event of all of these validators\u2019 shit. \n\nAnd if it\u2019s this costly to change a justified block, imagine how difficult it would be to reorg a finalized one. The details get a little tricky here for me, but I believe it would require over 2/3 of all validators losing all of their stake. Right now, that\u2019s $73 billion dollars worth of security. Not only would the benefit of coordinating this attack have to be worth more than $73 billion, but the attacker would also have to corrupt over 2/3 of the decentralized validators of Ethereum. That last statement is the reason that decentralization matters in Ethereum, and why home stakers are soooooo important. Ethereum needs to be able to withstand a full on moloch attack worth all the money that will ever be settled on top of the chain. Since we like to think that\u2019s the entire world\u2019s economy, the value of the eth securing the network by validators will only take us so far.

I've been a little out of the loop on that front so this was a bit of catch-up for me.

Based rollups, whose blocks are produced by L1 block proposers (and searchers+builders) have the advantage that the L1 and L2 blocks are both produced at the same time by the same person. That person can therefore make guarantees about L1-L2 and L2-L2 transaction atomicity, basically, preconfirmations. Only concern is L1 reorgs, for which Espresso provides an external finality gadget. So all L2s that use Espresso can participate in this shared sequencing, which plays out as a joint auction for all blocks together.\n* [Vladimir Novakovski, Founder and CEO of Lighter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vYC7_t3LM0) is working on a way to run an orderbook exchange using ZKPs. Order book exchanges are better at price discovery than AMMs and are less susceptible to MEV. So zkLighter is an app-specific L3 zk rollup on top of zkSync Era. They create a perfect binary merkle tree of order book data (or something like that), and use that as the basis for proof generation. Orders live on L3, executed trades settle on L2.\n* [The \"State of Staking\" Panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-hwsm8qO-Q) was previously documented by llamachef [Chef, 2024]. There wasn't too much in there I didn't already know, but the differences in attitude towards EigenLayer were interesting. From Diva being really skeptical to Blockdaemon kind of giving lip service to the cautionary messaging but already working to integrate AVSs.\n* After that, as a departure from the usual scheduling, the miscellaneous talks gave way to three \"mini-summits\". One was Matter Labs and zkSync, another was Mask Network (social media and identity stuff). [The one I went to was Polkadot's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtNhbhJHz8c). Thought it would be nice to look outside of the Ethereum community for once. The first talk was a high level overview of Polkadot. Most was not new to me, but I had forgotten that the logic for running the chain and consensus actually lives on the chain, so on-chain governance can directly modify fundamental behavior. XCM (cross chain messaging) is what Polkadot uses for, well, cross-chain messaging--I wonder if it's used anywhere else like Cosmos's IBC. If so, they're not doing a great job; IBC is really the standard now from what I've seen.\n* The other talks at the [Polkadot mini-summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtNhbhJHz8c) were from teams building parachains and apps: an identity protocol, coprocessor, decentralized compute network, distributed storage protocol, cross-chain messaging standard, and a blockchain data indexer. So really it's all the usual stuff that could show up in any ecosystem. The one thing that made it feel Polkadot-y is that they all put cross/multi-chain compatability front and center. which is to be expected.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ETHDenver Day 5</strong> (<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1b1ys3b/daily_general_discussion_february_28_2024/ksi3epo/\">Yesterday</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Another day in the BUIDLhub; the true craziness starts tomorrow.

They create a perfect binary merkle tree of order book data (or something like that), and use that as the basis for proof generation. Orders live on L3, executed trades settle on L2.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-hwsm8qO-Q\">The &quot;State of Staking&quot; Panel</a> was previously documented by llamachef [Chef, 2024]. There wasn&#39;t too much in there I didn&#39;t already know, but the differences in attitude towards EigenLayer were interesting. From Diva being really skeptical to Blockdaemon kind of giving lip service to the cautionary messaging but already working to integrate AVSs.</li>\n<li>After that, as a departure from the usual scheduling, the miscellaneous talks gave way to three &quot;mini-summits&quot;. One was Matter Labs and zkSync, another was Mask Network (social media and identity stuff). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtNhbhJHz8c\">The one I went to was Polkadot&#39;s</a>. Thought it would be nice to look outside of the Ethereum community for once. The first talk was a high level overview of Polkadot. Most was not new to me, but I had forgotten that the logic for running the chain and consensus actually lives on the chain, so on-chain governance can directly modify fundamental behavior. XCM (cross chain messaging) is what Polkadot uses for, well, cross-chain messaging--I wonder if it&#39;s used anywhere else like Cosmos&#39;s IBC. If so, they&#39;re not doing a great job; IBC is really the standard now from what I&#39;ve seen.</li>\n<li>The other talks at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtNhbhJHz8c\">Polkadot mini-summit</a> were from teams building parachains and apps: an identity protocol, coprocessor, decentralized compute network, distributed storage protocol, cross-chain messaging standard, and a blockchain data indexer. So really it&#39;s all the usual stuff that could show up in any ecosystem. The one thing that made it feel Polkadot-y is that they all put cross/multi-chain compatability front and center. which is to be expected.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-28 22:10:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ksnr3ia","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1b2t640","parent_id":"t3_1b2t640","score":25,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Rapante","body":"Thanks for doing these, interesting to read.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for doing these, interesting to read.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-02-29 00:41:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kso4rn9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1b2t640","parent_id":"t1_ksnr3ia","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/15kisFUD","body":"Sold a few percent at 3500.
