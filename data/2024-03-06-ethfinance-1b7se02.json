The initial target was marceau which prevented him to withdraw the RPL from his node for a few weeks. He had way more RPL not bonded to a minipool though, which he could have sold, but did not. Same story with other whales like patricio worthalter. They provided liquidity in the ETH/RPL pool quite a bit back then. In my view the grieving attack did not push the price upwards significantly. as far as I remember, when people could withdraw RPL again there was no big downwards move as all the hardcore RPL believers thought it will go higher anyways.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-06 22:46:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ktqeue9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1b7se02","parent_id":"t1_ktowspl","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/hereimalive","body":"Yeah, I opened a few minipools the last year and I've lost a bit of money with RPL, so now I have borrowed to get colateral above 10% and it went below it again after ETH went up.

A few other notes.\n\n- The alETH peg is a bit problematic right now. As soon as you deposit your collateral, you take a 10% hit on your APR because Alchemix takes a 10% cut of each harvest. So for example if you're holding rETH for 3.0% interest, you're only earning 2.7% by depositing in an Alchemix vault. So you\u2019re incentivized to immediately take a max loan (50%) and put the borrowed assets to work. The problem is the loans are denominated in alETH and it is trading at roughly 90% of ETH right now. It\u2019s supposed to be closer to 1:1 (though the floating target is 0.97 right now as I mentioned). So if you *do* take the max loan, you\u2019re basically also immediately losing 10% on your collateral as well if for example you want to trade your alETH for ETH. (If you sell the alETH for ETH and then immediately liquidate your loan, you're down 10%.)\n\n- If you\u2019re using main net, you need to keep gas prices in mind, because any time you want to borrow more alETH, you\u2019re going to pay a transaction fee. So let\u2019s say you deposit $10,000. Annually, you\u2019ll earn about $275 depending on the vault\u2019s strategy. But\u2026 it might cost you $100 in fees to collect that if gas is really high. So for anything less than $10k you\u2019re probably losing money unless you go to an L2\n\n- The main benefit I could see to utilizing a vault right away, even with the poor peg, is to negate taxes. But you\u2019d need to talk with a tax accountant. For example if you\u2019ve been holding say $200,000 of ETH and it\u2019s up $100k but you\u2019re still in short-term capital gains territory, if you sell it you might owe $40,000 and only keep $60,000.
