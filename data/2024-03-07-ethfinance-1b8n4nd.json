They both have a long history of contributions to the RP community. \n\nNodeSet had the idea of constellation - a set of node operators who would take NodeSet's ETH and RPL and give them to existing Rocket Pool node operators who joined NodeSet. **To join NS, you have to be a RP NO for a min of 6 months, have an effectiveness rating above 95%, and pass an interview that's a kind of sybil check.** \n\nTheir idea is that Rocket Pool has stagnated, and there are not enough people who have eth, who have rpl, and who have any interest in running a node. They are of the idea that if we could get eth and RPL into the hands of existing NO, it would help everyone involved. **NodeSet would get a cut of the commission, NO would get a cut of the commission, people who staked through NS would get outsized returns, and Rocket Pool would grow. win-win-win-win!** This is exactly what they are about to do. \n\nTheir main products will be xrETH and xRPL - these are their liquid staking tokens that will be unique on the market. Both products will offer market-beating rewards for your eth and RPL deposits. How do they do this? They will be earning rewards from Rocket Pool for staked eth and RPL, and taking the boosted yields for themselves and their node operators while their customers get the base staking rewards. **Their LST will be a 100% staking reward token - touted as zero commission**. xRPL will offer yields better than depositing into Aave or providing liquidity on an AMM as NS would only take a small % of the rpl staking rewards and passing on the rest to xRPL holders. \n\nNS has recruited 150 existing RP NOs, and they want to recruit 150 more NO before their protocol goes live. They explain how, if xrETH (their LST) can reach 10% of Rocket Pool's TVL, each of their 150 node operators will receive around 70 validators to stake on behalf of their protocol. **The commission they would get on this would be around 5 eth a year! Once RP transitions to LEB4s, they think it could be as much as 10 eth a year!** This system is secured because NS would set the withdrawal credentials of the node to their wallets, and node operators would send them pre-signed exit messages which would help get the eth and RPL back in the case of any problems. \n\nJust imagine this. **If you spend 10.4 eth (8 eth + 2.4 eth of RPL) to become a Rocket Pool NO today, in 6 months you'll be eligible to become a NS NO. Depending on how fast they grow and how many other NOs they have, you'll be able to make as much as 100% returns on your initial investment into RP in a year!** Even in their most conservative estimates for NO with just one validator, you'll earn 2.7x more than your regular staking rewards. More realistically, you'll earn somewhere between 10x and 30x solo staking rewards. In this case, exposure to the RPL token really will be an entry ticket into massive rewards. There is no other cost for node operators to join NodeSet. \n\nDoes this sound **too good to be true?** Of course, these rewards depend on a lot of factors including how quickly NS can attract eth and RPL deposits into their protocol and how quickly Rocket Pool can mint rETH to turn their deposits into validators. They'll have to balance more than just what Rocket Pool has to manage as a protocol. Saying that, **they already have commitments for huge eth and RPL deposits.** They expect to hit the ground running. \n\nSo, when does this go live? NodeSet's constellation will **go live in around 3 months after Rocket Pool's Houston upgrade which is scheduled for May 6th**.

The basic idea of DePIn is to expand the sharing economy to computation. Rather than restricting provider access to a few tech-oligarchs like Amazon the DePIn movement is trying to expand access to everyone. BTC and ETH PoW were the early permissionless players for decentralized computation. But over time BTC mining became dominated by a few miner oligarchs who could source ASICS and ETH obviously moved to PoS. With most other coins not being worth the effort to mine this left a market gap for something to do with your gaming GPUs while you sleep/work. What we're seeing with DePIn today is the rise of compelling alternatives that fill this gap mostly driven by surging investment and demand for AI.\n\nThe idea of decentralizing computation isn't a new one. Prior to blockchain I remember a Playstation app called [folding@home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home). Even before that I suppose we had Napster (yeah I'm getting old). What blockchain brought to the scene that these foundational apps lacked was the potential to compensate participants monetarily. I recall learning about [Golem](https://www.golem.network/) when I was first entering this space. Their idea was to create a GPU marketplace and use the blockchain for peer-to-peer payments. They were one of the darlings of the 2017 ICO era and... [they're still going](https://blog.golem.network/golem-gpu-beta-testing-program-launch/) I guess?\n\nGolem was probably visionary but too early. It sucks being right but too soon\u2122 but it happens to the best of us sometimes. What I think makes now a ripe moment for another attempt at this concept is first as I said above the alternative of ETH mining is gone and second we've discovered a new practically infinite pile of work with AI. Right now that is creating huge moves for players like [BitTensor](https://bittensor.com/) and [Akash](https://akash.network/) but I think with the pattern being established we'll also see success for teams like [Render Network](https://rendernetwork.com/) for rendering and [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) for decentralized wifi. Just around the corner we also have teams like [Gensyn](https://www.gensyn.ai/) which are doing AI model training and innumerable [AVSs](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/avs-guides/avs-developer-guide) which will change the collateralization model.\n\nAt their core, before we worry about what network they run on, what task they are solving, what collateral they take, their tokenomics, etc., all DePIn projects share a common challenge: The work itself is being done off-chain so how do we verify that work was honestly done? If I ask you to render something and it comes back solid black was the problem in the rendering or in the task description? I call this the verification problem and it's the first thing I ask every DePIn project I evaluate.\n\nSo how do we verify off-chain work? There are three schools of thought which I will cover below. Solutions to the verification problem vary greatly from task to task. In all cases though the verification must have a few properties:\n\n1) The quantity of work done can be verified (at least statistically) in much less time than it takes to do the work. The longer verification takes the smaller the number of nodes the network can support.\n\n2) The work needs to be non-reusable. Someone shouldn't be able to do work once and be compensated for it multiple times.\n\nWithin these constraints let's go over the various patterns I've seen for the verification problem.\n\nFirst, there is is the formal proof-of-work approach. This applies when the work itself can be used to derive a proof that can be verified in near constant time. Bitcoin hashing is the most famous example of this. You don't submit every hash you do to a mining pool or the network. You only submit the best hash you have and from that we can infer the amount of work you statistically must have done to find that hash. The final hash is the proof of a much larger body of hashes you must have created and discarded. For other tasks you can construct a zk-proof of work in addition to doing the actual work. The effort that goes into the zk-proof may be quite substantial though and zk-proofs in general are cutting edge research so I don't see very much of this yet. In the long term though, zk-proofs will rule the world.\n\nThe second approach is some form of sampling. This applies to things like rendering wherein the output is both deterministic and [embarrassingly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel). The concept here is similar to the [Panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon); given that you don't know when the guards are looking you always have to behave as if they are. It achieves security with less work/cost. For DePIn with sampling, each worker won't know which segment of the embarrassingly parallel task will be replicated during verification and given that they have some collateral to lose if they misbehave the optimal action for each worker is just to do the work honestly. All we have to do is ensure that the penalty for cheating times the chance of being detected is greater than the reward. This is how [Render Network](https://rendernetwork.com/) tackles verification of rendering tasks; validation only requires a small subset of the entire image and that subset can be generated deterministically from the job description. [DA Scaling](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/18nfxvo/daily_general_discussion_december_21_2023/keekm8z/) is solved similarly; due to erasure coding only a scalable percentage of the data needs to be requested to know that all of the data can be reconstructed.\n\nThe third approach is subjective consensus which I'll summarize with a [timeless quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95kNwZw8YY): \"Yeah, well, you know, that's just like, uh, your opinion man\". This applies when you can't figure out what a proof would look like for the task being done. Sometimes this is because the task is state-dependent such as solving the n'th prime or non-deterministic due to latency differences so sampling isn't a viable option. Sometimes this is just because they haven't written a proof yet and plan on creating one later.\n\nThe most common example of subjective consensus is every oracle you've ever known. Smart contracts can only refer to chain state. They can't see BTC price feeds on Kraken for example. All data that is off-chain is subjective from the perspective of the chain. Each node in the oracle will see *slightly* different answers for a price feed just based on *exactly* when they query the Kraken API. It's impossible to synchronize so the answer looks non-deterministic even amongst honest nodes. When this happens, consensus is decided subjectively. Each node just comes to an answer *somehow* and then the system reconciles those opinions into a single number that is written to a chain that determines your payout. Oracles commonly uses something like a median to determine the output truth and then distance from the median to determine how much to compensate/slash each node. This is the basic design of things like Chainlink and BitTensor.\n\nThe last approach that I usually run for the hills if I see is basically \"just trust me bro\". This is basically a hole where a design should be. These systems rely on the customer to just stop using your platform if the compute provider isn't performing honest work.\n\nHope this provides some context for anyone who hasn't looked into this sector yet. Things are going to get **a lot** more exciting and heated in this space once we start getting serious AVSs.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m seeing a major uptick recently in DePIn (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) projects.
