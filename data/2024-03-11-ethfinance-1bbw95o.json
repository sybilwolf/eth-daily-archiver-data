Starknet has a lot more flexibility to improve because it&#39;s not boxed in.</li>\n<li>Starknet&#39;s team was extremely open and transparent with us, spent a lot of time talking with us before we made our decision, and really taught us why STARKs would be more impactful over SNARKs </li>\n<li>Optimistic rollups simply would not work for a game like Influence and what we wanted to do. We need &quot;instant&quot; finality and fraud proofs for a game that relies on immeasurable connectivity between player actions. It&#39;s a massive web, and a malicious actor trying to submit actions that are inaccurate that could roll the game state back is incredibly challenging for an MMO </li>\n<li>I don&#39;t think I can understate the incredible utility of having Native Account Abstraction. I know I previously stated the UX is improved, but it&#39;s so much more than that. No other chain on Ethereum has the ability to make consumer grade apps with this level of customizability, all without sacrificing on security or decentralization.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Personally, I think Starknet has a lot still to prove, but I am very happy with the progress they have made. On the tech side I think it&#39;s hard to beat.

So he doesn\u2019t take into account any pressure from Tradfi to the SEC.  I put more credence in Jake Chervinsky\u2019s analysis. He\u2019s made a couple of valid points but overal I think the sentiment has shifted too negative. With the BTC ETF everyone was talking about the impressive track record of Blackrock and that Fink always gets what he wants. Why is that suddenly not an issue anymore? It\u2019s hard to rhyme the low approval odds with Blackrock\u2019s track record.
