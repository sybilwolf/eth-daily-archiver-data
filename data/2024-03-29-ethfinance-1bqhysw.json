/u/syentist discussed that L2s may migrate to alt-DA layers pushed out by blobscriptions.\n\nI disagree that this will be a significant trend and this post is simply to try to clarify why I see it like this. If you have a look at \nhttps://dune.com/hildobby/blobs you will notice that after an initial burst in activity when they were released the blob usage has stabilized quite well around 3 blobs. The reason is obvious, above 3 blobs the EIP-1559 like mechanism of blob fee raise kicks in and as it's an exponential feedback it reacts very aggressively to overdemand and raises fees very significantly. When that happens appetite for minting an NFT dies down pretty quick. So blobscriptions are simply saturating the blobspace left empty until 3 target blobs. \n\nBut as more and more blobspace will get filled by L2s, less and less blobspace will be left for blobscriptions until the target 3 blobs is entirely filled by L2s. When that happens, blobscriptions will be priced out of blobspace because L2s will be able to afford much higher blob fees than an NFT. For the very simple reason that an L2 can reflect that price across the fees of 100s of transactions, so a blob price increase induces a much smaller L2 price increase.\n\nSo I think blobscriptions are just a temporary parasite of blobspace, while it's used undercapacity. In undercapacity conditions the EIP-1559 mechanism literally sends prices to 0 and in this conditions they can flourish. But they die naturally when pushed beyond certain USD price of blob fees, and L2s are far less sensitive to higher blob prices. This is basically the same reason why we pretty much never had inscriptions on Ethereum blockspace while they were a plague on alt-L1s. High added value transactions kill inscriptions.\n\nThere is only one caveat on this. You need an EIP-1559 like mechanism that increases fees in overdemand conditions with a burn mechanism. This is the spam protection mechanism that pushes out low-value transactions. The burn gives an objective and real cost to blockspace.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yesterday <a href=\"/u/syentist\">/u/syentist</a> discussed that L2s may migrate to alt-DA layers pushed out by blobscriptions.</p>\n\n<p>I disagree that this will be a significant trend and this post is simply to try to clarify why I see it like this.

Then come others like Arbitrum bridge, Kraken, Robin Hood, Optimism bridge etc. The first account where I think it can belong to a single person owns slightly more then 350000 ETH that is around 0.3% of the network.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously one can easily spread their crypto over many addresses to not show up in such a rich list. Bitcoin does this automatically through their UTXO model, but it is pretty simple to spread out the ETH as well.</p>\n\n<p>I would summarize that the distribution of ether actually looks better than the distribution of Bitcoins. Does this prevent me from owning bitcoin? Not really. Both distributions are imperfect and lean heavily towards whales. But to me at least it looks like the pre-sale did not have a negative impact on the distribution. One might not like pre-sales, that is a bias some people have, but I have not seen actual evidence that the pre-sale has a negative impact on the current distribution.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-03-30 01:14:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kx87pxn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1bqhysw","parent_id":"t1_kx61rkr","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/shiftli","body":"> Beacon chain deposit contract with over 35%.\n> That ETH can never ever exit, ever. \n\nHuh?
