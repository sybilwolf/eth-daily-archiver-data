It sees crypto as a giant casino, where if you're ~~lucky~~ better and faster at reading the trends and moods and narratives, you can become rich overnight, and escape the increasingly dystopian financial state of society. Fundamentals are not the bedrock of deciding what is and isn't a good deal, in this mentality - they are a ball and chain that keeps an asset tethered to reality, when what you actually want is one that is free to ascend into outer space with no pesky P/E ratios or highly technical upgrades to slow understanding and buzz. The more innocent an asset is of any practical use, the less beholden it therefore is to actually needing to support that use, to actually addressing that market, to actually *working*. If you're not *supposed* to do anything, you can't fail, and the market can't fail to understand what you do!\n\nBy contrast, most of us here would consider ourselves investors. We *do* care about utility, and we *do* care about real yields, and we *do* watch each upgrade with bated breath, and we *do* follow the discourse on roadmaps and adoption. We care about those pesky fundamentals, because we understand that having a fundamentals-driven thesis is the difference between investing and gambling, and we **are not here to gamble.** Ethereum, which by this point is deeply embedded in the crypto and web3 ecosystems, and which has, by most metrics, already won the adoption war - that's something we can sink our teeth into, and the fundamentals look *pristine*. Ethereum is bae for us because in buying it, we can feel secure that we are *investing* in something that has real underlying value beyond memes and narratives and the attention economy.\n\nConsider the chasm between those two mentalities, and consider that we are in the *incredibly distinct* minority right now. We're rocking up to a casino with spreadsheets and reams of research. And we're shocked when the degenerates around us take one look at our stodgy \"internet of value\", our \"global settlement layer\", our \"world computer\", and pass it by, because *it has won a battle that memecoins are not even trying to fight.* \n\nTimes are changing, of course. The gamblers that still make up the large majority of the market are soon going to be dwarfed by the massive capital that institutional investment can bring to bear, and make no mistake, those investors of size *do* do their homework, they *do* care about fundamentals. They know, like we do, that selling shovels during this gold rush is the best way to profit, and that Ethereum is that shovel, and moreover, that it will grow into the digital equivalent of Manhattan real estate in the fullness of time. How soon these more competent investors will arrive en masse is hard to say, of course - we've been crying out, \"the institutions are coming, the institutions are coming\" like some kind of latter-day Bilbo Baggins for years now. But I think most would agree that the ETF approvals, whenever they may come, will in many ways herald that advent. The time of fundamentals is not here yet, but it is coming.\n\nSo while we all sit here gnashing our teeth and pulling our hair while the markets happily ignore our precious Ethereum, keep in mind that while we're a tiny component of those markets today, what we really are is *forerunners*. \n\nWe're not the last of our kind in a world devoid of reason, raging against the dying of the light.\n\nWe're the first.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Like most of the rest of you, I sometimes ponder why Ethereum in recent years tends to perform so... differently... from many other cryptoassets out there.</p>\n\n<p>I keep coming back to this one reason:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Most people today buy crypto to gamble, not to invest.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The market, broadly speaking, is not interested in fundamentals.
