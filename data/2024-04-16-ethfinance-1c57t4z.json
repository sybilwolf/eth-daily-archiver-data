That&#39;s suitable for PT but not YT. You can approach Yearn on their Discord. I talked to them about making a leveraged Alchemix Yearn Vault that would basically just execute The Double Logris. The stopping point was always that the vaults were full. On the Alchemix side they&#39;re still auditing the LogrisLeveragoor (working title). I built a LogrisVault at EthDenver in 2023 with plans to integrate it into Alchemix but they didn&#39;t want to give it privileged access to vault capacity so we got bogged down in queue system discussions until they eventually said they are working to address vault capacity more permanently in Alchemix v3.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-17 09:41:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l00cten","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1c57t4z","parent_id":"t1_kzy671r","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"You know you could restake that rwswtfETH for hyper points and then split it and put it all into hyper yield component which you borrow against on ratFI to flash leverage up on YTwhyrwswtfETH right?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You know you could restake that rwswtfETH for hyper points and then split it and put it all into hyper yield component which you borrow against on ratFI to flash leverage up on YTwhyrwswtfETH right?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-16 16:43:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kzwrchq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1c57t4z","parent_id":"t1_kzw9rz2","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/2peg2city","body":"could probably LP the fuck out of TYwhyrwswtfETH/rwswtfETH","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>could probably LP the fuck out of TYwhyrwswtfETH/rwswtfETH</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-16 17:11:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kzwvni3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1c57t4z","parent_id":"t1_kzwrchq","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/doomfuzzslayer","body":"I agree the potential returns are better but I sleep well at night holding straight rwswtfETH.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I agree the potential returns are better but I sleep well at night holding straight rwswtfETH.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-04-16 17:06:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"kzwuu3i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1c57t4z","parent_id":"t1_kzwrchq","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/deep_archivist","body":"Hey All, are there any decentralized, or at least permissionless bridges to move wbtc to Bitcoin chain (and vice-versa?).

If you try to transfer your ENS domain that's linked to your Zora profile to a new profile, you might brick your new profile.\n\n\nRecently I was looking forward to dropping a lot of unreleased music on Zora. The platform has a lot of potential, I like it's rather barebones and simple UI, and also appreciate the flexibility of being able to make drops on a variety of L2s. Creators can also earn from free mints, so that is a nice plus. At a glance, it seems like a promising new option for easy onboarding of artists. Someone even minted one of my drops, which has never happened in the past. Especially after dencun, the UX for dropping NFTs has never been better.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I mucked it all up and have to overcomplicate everything. \ud83d\ude23 I transferred my ENS to make my artist drops via a fresh Zora profile and address, due to my ENS being linked to an old hot wallet. As a platform, Zora seems to permanently link your Ethereum address and email address to your Zora profile, making it impossible to migrate or link to a separate profile, and seemingly, your ENS domain gets permanently associated as well. As I have already created my new profile and dropped a few NFTs, I noticed that my new profile does not show up at all in the search results on Zora and is seemingly invisible, but my old profile still shows right up with my ENS still being linked to it, although that is not the case anymore.\n\n\nThere is, however, an option to request a manual deletion of your old Zora profile, which is unfortunately quite a centralized way of managing this. So I've opened a support ticket, hoping this would solve the issue. It's been 3 days with no reply. So here I am feeling like a clown for being in this situation, while I could be making drops and promoting my work in the meantime, all because of course I had to be the odd one who wanted to use their same ENS name on a fresh address/profile, and possibly inadvertently got myself shadow-banned in the process. \ud83d\udc80\n\n\nIf there's ever an airdrop for Zora, I'm probably on anti-Sybil list now. After being burnt out on the web2 social media model and not doing many releases for awhile, my excitement about a new way to new release content via Zora + Warpcast is now deflated. A problem with being a creator who wants to share your content is becoming demotivated from all the hoops you have to jump through or busy-work involved in social media management, or all your momentum getting killed due to some weird obstacle like this.\n\n\nNot sure where to go from here. Should I actually just create *another* completely new Zora profile + ENS and try to start all over yet again? Searching the Zora Discord, I discovered a few other people had this issue through the years but were never replied to. I'm wondering how likely it is that I bricked my profile or if this is actually solveable. As bugs commonly take a long time to fix for a lot of applications, I'm not too keen on waiting around for someone to fix this. Assuming this is some built-in anti-Sybil feature, I'm a bit frustrated if my only option is to start over with a different ENS domain at this point, as my ENS domain, which I have paid for, was my artist name and is now useless due to seemingly being permanently linked to a profile I would like to retire.

If you try to transfer your ENS domain that&#39;s linked to your Zora profile to a new profile, you might brick your new profile.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I was looking forward to dropping a lot of unreleased music on Zora. The platform has a lot of potential, I like it&#39;s rather barebones and simple UI, and also appreciate the flexibility of being able to make drops on a variety of L2s. Creators can also earn from free mints, so that is a nice plus. At a glance, it seems like a promising new option for easy onboarding of artists. Someone even minted one of my drops, which has never happened in the past. Especially after dencun, the UX for dropping NFTs has never been better.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I mucked it all up and have to overcomplicate everything. \ud83d\ude23 I transferred my ENS to make my artist drops via a fresh Zora profile and address, due to my ENS being linked to an old hot wallet. As a platform, Zora seems to permanently link your Ethereum address and email address to your Zora profile, making it impossible to migrate or link to a separate profile, and seemingly, your ENS domain gets permanently associated as well. As I have already created my new profile and dropped a few NFTs, I noticed that my new profile does not show up at all in the search results on Zora and is seemingly invisible, but my old profile still shows right up with my ENS still being linked to it, although that is not the case anymore.</p>\n\n<p>There is, however, an option to request a manual deletion of your old Zora profile, which is unfortunately quite a centralized way of managing this. So I&#39;ve opened a support ticket, hoping this would solve the issue. It&#39;s been 3 days with no reply. So here I am feeling like a clown for being in this situation, while I could be making drops and promoting my work in the meantime, all because of course I had to be the odd one who wanted to use their same ENS name on a fresh address/profile, and possibly inadvertently got myself shadow-banned in the process. \ud83d\udc80</p>\n\n<p>If there&#39;s ever an airdrop for Zora, I&#39;m probably on anti-Sybil list now. After being burnt out on the web2 social media model and not doing many releases for awhile, my excitement about a new way to new release content via Zora + Warpcast is now deflated. A problem with being a creator who wants to share your content is becoming demotivated from all the hoops you have to jump through or busy-work involved in social media management, or all your momentum getting killed due to some weird obstacle like this.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure where to go from here. Should I actually just create <em>another</em> completely new Zora profile + ENS and try to start all over yet again? Searching the Zora Discord, I discovered a few other people had this issue through the years but were never replied to. I&#39;m wondering how likely it is that I bricked my profile or if this is actually solveable.
