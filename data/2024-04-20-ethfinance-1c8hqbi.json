Now in the last 1-2 days there are first reports of people seeing exact numbers for BTC and BCH they are expected to get. Not guaranteed crypto transfers are about to start in ~2 weeks, but possible.

My more valuable wallets have been getting hit with address poisoning attacks, which at this point I would hope most people here are familiar with. And this should *really* be addressed with better tools at the wallet/etherscan level.\n\nBut more interestingly, my personal cell phone was hit today with a text message:\n> COINBASE: An unauthorized device from Salt Lake City, Utah has logged into your Coinbase account. If this was not authorized by you, please reply with \"N\". If this was authorized by you ignore this message.\n\nI caught on immediately, in part because I wasn't actually sure I *have* a Coinbase account (I checked, and I do, but I didn't even really complete account setup, never set it up to receive fiat or crypto funds). But also because I had just recently read [this article on Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/lastpass-users-targeted-in-phishing-attacks-good-enough-to-trick-even-the-savvy/), which describes the abilities of the CryptoChameleon phishing-as-a-service toolkit. It's a really good read, would recommend. But the first step of one of CryptoChameleon's techniques is described to be similar: a phone call telling the recipient that there was an unauthorized login and asking them to press \"1\" or \"2\" to accept or deny.\n\nThis is kind of tricky because there's not really any immediate danger in replying \"N\" (or pressing \"2\" to deny). If it's legit then you've done your part to prevent an attack. If it's not legit, then all you've done is sent a pointless text message. And users have become increasingly used to dealing with these kinds of messages from all sorts of account logins, so it may not ring any alarm bells. Why not send a quick \"N\" and be done with it?\n\nBut my understanding is that the first step of a scam is by far the most important. On one hand, some scams deliberately use dubious sounding claims (Nigerian prince, anyone?) as an initial filter, so that the savvy users weed themselves out, and the people who actually respond are more likely to be duped by the subsequent requests. But that's probably just a side-benefit here, maybe allowing the recipients without Coinbase accounts to filter themselves out. And it's notable that this message asks for action to deny and a non-response to approve. The vast majority of legit messages of this kind are the other way around: silence means deny. And that's smart, that's the way it *should* be.\n\nMore relevant this time is a sort of a sunk cost fallacy. In the world of video games that are \"free to play\" but with microtransactions for additional bonuses, it's well understood that getting the user to make their first payment is a massive step. Once someone has caved and paid once, they're much more likely to continue to do so. And at some point you can ask me about the fascinating ways in which a scammer on the streets of Istanbul employed a bunch of tricks to make it really hard for me to disengage once we had started talking, but that's a longer story. But in short: if a scammer can get you to take the first step, you're much more likely to fall for the following steps. So in this case, having the first step be something so likely to get casual responses means a higher success rate as a whole.\n\nIf the CryptoChameleon playbook described by Ars is accurate, there would probably be a followup text or email with a link to a fake phishing Coinbase login page, ready to take my password. I would hope even if people fell for the first step, they'd catch the issue at this point, but the danger could be that the first step being fairly risk-free would cause people to let their guard down.\n\nThis turned out longer than I planned, hope it reads all right. *tl;dr*: Scams nowadays will likely start with \"unauthorized device/login\" messages, these kinds of messages should make you consider if the source could be a scammer.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve got an addition to <a href=\"/u/haurog\">/u/haurog</a> &#39;s <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1c7okhx/daily_general_discussion_april_19_2024/l09nkij/\">scam watchlist</a> from yesterday.
