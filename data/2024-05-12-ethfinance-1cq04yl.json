Completely non-custodially. Their smart contracts are audited by Halborn and Sigma Prime (company behind the Lighthouse CL client). Vault operators have the ability to get a verified status.\n\nIt also provides some benefits to non-professional node operators. Say you have 32ETH of your own to stake, you can create a StakeWise vault and join StakeWise's version of the smoothing pool and/or make part of your staked ETH liquid (osETH - be aware an extra 5% fee applies when you mint osETH). You can also set up a vault for some friends - say there's 4 friends with 8ETH each. They can put it into a vault together, one of them runs the validator and they split the rewards automatically without dealing with multisigs or other splitter contracts. You can make your vault private, ensuring only whitelisted depositors can stake through it.\n\nFrom a depositor's point of view it's got some pretty cool features - you can choose a node operator based on your specific preferences. Your rewards compound (unfortunately this is a bit of a centralizing vector - the bigger the vault, the more efficient the compounding but there's no way around that). You can make your stake liquid on-demand by minting osETH, which can then also be restaked if you're into that.\n\nCompared to Rocket Pool - well, to be fair, Rocket Pool is still the more decentralized option. However, Rocket Pool is not without downsides either. As a node operator, you're exposed to RPL. As a depositor, fees are relatively high.\n\nPersonally I believe that as long as you don't pick a huge staking node operator on StakeWise who already controls like 1% of all validators, it's not such a bad choice from a decentralization point of view either.\n\nPotential downsides to StakeWise V3 that I haven't mentioned yet:\n\n- It's still relatively new, having launched at the end of November '23.\n- osETH liquidity may be limited. How much of an issue that is depends on your size.\n\nOur team has been working with StakeWise since last summer, I myself even contributed to their operator service so I'm pretty familiar with how it works.

They can put it into a vault together, one of them runs the validator and they split the rewards automatically without dealing with multisigs or other splitter contracts. You can make your vault private, ensuring only whitelisted depositors can stake through it.</p>\n\n<p>From a depositor&#39;s point of view it&#39;s got some pretty cool features - you can choose a node operator based on your specific preferences. Your rewards compound (unfortunately this is a bit of a centralizing vector - the bigger the vault, the more efficient the compounding but there&#39;s no way around that). You can make your stake liquid on-demand by minting osETH, which can then also be restaked if you&#39;re into that.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to Rocket Pool - well, to be fair, Rocket Pool is still the more decentralized option. However, Rocket Pool is not without downsides either. As a node operator, you&#39;re exposed to RPL. As a depositor, fees are relatively high.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I believe that as long as you don&#39;t pick a huge staking node operator on StakeWise who already controls like 1% of all validators, it&#39;s not such a bad choice from a decentralization point of view either.</p>\n\n<p>Potential downsides to StakeWise V3 that I haven&#39;t mentioned yet:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&#39;s still relatively new, having launched at the end of November &#39;23.</li>\n<li>osETH liquidity may be limited. How much of an issue that is depends on your size.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our team has been working with StakeWise since last summer, I myself even contributed to their operator service so I&#39;m pretty familiar with how it works.
