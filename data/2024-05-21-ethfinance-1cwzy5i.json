Kraken took down staking for Americans at the request of SEC, BUT Kraken&#39;s subsidiary, Staked, is still allowed to operate in USA and was seemingly not impacted by the same settlement agreement that its parent company was. Moreover, Staked&#39;s founder <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/kWrOo2C.png\">strongly suggested</a> they were unaffected because they do not control users keys/have always been non-custodial. Pooling may also be a point of contention (Staked requires a full 32 ETH to stake with them) but point being, the trust element of someone else running the validator/staking for them <em>by itself</em> might not be a major factor, because if it was it seems likely Staked would have been shut down in US as well. </p>\n\n<p>So that is to say if trusting a third party to staking is an issue that makes ETH derivatives more security-like, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a single factor of getting rewards from 3rd parties, but is rather some combination of these rewards + how the validators are operated + how withdrawal keys are managed + how funds are pooled</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-21 14:06:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l52t845","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cwzy5i","parent_id":"t1_l52qpkq","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/JebediahKholin","body":"I believe each entity is going to challenge it in court, like Coinbase is currently regarding their staking service.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I believe each entity is going to challenge it in court, like Coinbase is currently regarding their staking service.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-21 13:54:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l52r4y6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cwzy5i","parent_id":"t1_l52qpkq","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Papazio","body":">Mr President, I have to ask, why have you changed your stance on our crypto policy? \n\n>Look General Warren, I know that that you and Gary have been working very hard but the facts are that there are more crypto people than we thought, they are more organised than we thought, they have a lot more money than we thought, and the polls for November aren\u2019t looking good right now.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Mr President, I have to ask, why have you changed your stance on our crypto policy? </p>\n\n<p>Look General Warren, I know that that you and Gary have been working very hard but the facts are that there are more crypto people than we thought, they are more organised than we thought, they have a lot more money than we thought, and the polls for November aren\u2019t looking good right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-21 15:22:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l53535i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cwzy5i","parent_id":"t3_1cwzy5i","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/EvanVanNess","body":" it may happen today.  apparently it's most likely slated for wednesday, but who knows.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>it may happen today.  apparently it&#39;s most likely slated for wednesday, but who knows.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-21 00:32:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l4zo75b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cwzy5i","parent_id":"t3_1cwzy5i","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/maninthecryptosuit","body":"Now that would be a surprise (today instead of 23rd)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Now that would be a surprise (today instead of 23rd)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-21 00:50:05","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-05-21 01:10:51","id":"l4zpiim","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cwzy5i","parent_id":"t1_l4zo75b","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/EvanVanNess","body":"maybe not to all of us https://x.com/evan_van_ness/status/1790813944031924312","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>maybe not to all of us <a href=\"https://x.com/evan_van_ness/status/1790813944031924312\">https://x.com/evan_van_ness/status/1790813944031924312</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-21 00:53:32","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l4zprum","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1cwzy5i","parent_id":"t1_l4zpiim","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/maninthecryptosuit","body":"Oh I meant a surprise that it would be approved today instead of by the 23rd.\n\nFWIW I agree with your tweet.
