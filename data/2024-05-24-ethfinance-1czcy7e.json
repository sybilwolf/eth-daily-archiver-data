And was asked what my most controversial take was. I said I think the ETH ETF would be approved by the end of the summer. The interviewer strongly disagreed and said there were not any signs pointing towards that. They decided to pass on me after the second interview. Oh well I will just keep building.   \n   \nIn other news I have been collecting a bunch of data to start to look into the correlation between price/price change/market cap/market cap change and social media/GitHub metics. My first shallow dive into some of the data showed a Pearson correlation of 0.72 (which is pretty damn good) between market cap and twitter followers. After dropping meme coins (often have bought/fake followers), CEX tokens (they have a bunch of followers because they are well known, but most tokens are not valuable), and pure BNB ecosystem tokens (the theory here is that Chinese users probably don't use crypto Twitter much, which I would assume are a large percentage of BNB buyers and users). Going to test the correlation going back historically next, and see how this changes during bear/bull. Will also look to see if month over month changes in market cap are correlated with month over month Twitter follower count change. Finally I want to use all this to build a index / watch list for coins that are gaining momentum, tying in trends that indicate a coin in the say top 200 to top 500 by market cap is on a trajectory to the top 100 by MC. My theory is two fold, one is network effects, the more followers a page has the more it gets shown to other users via the algo and second coins are the ultimate marketing tool as buyers are likely to talk about a project when they buy, trying to get others to buy, others will follow the project to learn more before potentially buying then repeating the process. Plus most projects get more useful with more users and liquidity/TVL.\n   \nAny feedback or thought ideas are much appreciated.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Had a first round interview at one the biggest crypto media companies in the space on May 6th.

We note Galaxy analysts anticipate that S-1s will be finalized and trading may start in July or August 2024. We note this important step yesterday towards the final approval comes after a sudden reversal in regulatory sentiment earlier this week when the SEC seemingly reengaged with stakeholders after months of stalled conversations.\nWe view this ETF approval, and crypto more broadly, as an increasingly political issue ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. As such, we expect trading of the spot ETH ETF to begin well-ahead of November.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p>\n\n<p>Older TradFi comments:</p>\n\n<p>Ken Griffin: \u201cEthereum will replace Bitcoin\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Carl Icahn: \u201cPrefers Ethereum over Bitcoin, it\u2019s a store of value and a payment system\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Stanley Druckenmiller: \u201cPredicts Ethereum might eventually dominate Bitcoin\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ray Dalio: Owns BTC and ETH and believes crypto has a place in portfolios</p>\n\n<p>Jamie Dimon: Against pet rock (BTC) but believes Ethereum has use cases </p>\n\n<p>Paul Tudor Jones: \u201cIndustrial digital asset\u201d \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d \u201cHeaps of protocols have been developed that interact with real-world traditional companies\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Larry Fink: \u201cIt\u2019s about tokenization\u201d, talks about putting the financial system on a decentralized ledger</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-24 04:39:35","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l5gh1e0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1czcy7e","parent_id":"t3_1czcy7e","score":44,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Holy shit, this hopium is so good that it\u2019s making me never want to sell!!!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Holy shit, this hopium is so good that it\u2019s making me never want to sell!!!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-05-24 04:49:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l5gi72k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1czcy7e","parent_id":"t1_l5gh1e0","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Boydbme","body":"Love the overall sentiment!

HOPR itself is a mix network which has many nodes which mix the communication between them making the actual communication pathway hard to trace and therefore making it pretty difficult to connect incoming and outgoing communication. The most famous mix net is TOR (The Onion Router). The HOPR net itself uses gnosis chain to incentivize node operators and there are currently around 400 nodes in the network. Now, the plan is to add a VPN on top of it. The advantage of their setup compared to a classical VPN is that in a classical VPN you have to trust the VPN provider to no track you, whereas with Gnosis VPN no node has the full information about your communication. They cannot stitch it back together themselves as they are missing a lot of parts. The development for this just started and it will  take at least until next year to get a first implementation. I am really curious how the will handle entry and exit nodes as they are probably the most critical parts and I am not sure if HOPR node operators would want to run these things from their home. Latency is another interesting problem as all these mix stages add quite a bit of delay, so maybe you will not run your multiplayer game through it, but they mentioned that they think about running validators through it as well, but it seems to be rather far away. \n\nHere is the talk: https://www.youtube.com/live/xRAG5oIrwH4?feature=shared&t=2407\n\n\nThe second talk is the shutterized beacon chain. The basic idea there is that when you make a transaction you encrypt it and the encrypted version gets included on chain. This inital transaction does not execute the transaction you sent, but it defines a certain order of transaction inclusion in one of the following blocks. In a next step, validators which are part of the shutter network come together to decrypt the message and then execute the actual transaction. The catch now is, that they have to execute it in the exact same order as it was included when it was encrypted. This prevents sandwich bots to extract MEV from your transaction. The most interesting part is that their current implementation does not need a hardfork. They just need a smart contract which insures the correct ordering and a modified execution client, nethermind in this case, to run it. They just started their first testnet on Chiado, which is the testnet for Gnosis chain. As far as I understand you can participate there as well as long as you spin up a validator on chiado.
