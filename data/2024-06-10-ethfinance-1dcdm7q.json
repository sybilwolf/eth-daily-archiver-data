I hope you take them to heart. People who have been around this space long enough will have heard all of this dozens of times. Some of this is ancient history. All of it is still relevant. As your understanding deepens it's probably worth re-reading this periodically because some of these phrases will take on layered meanings.\n\n**Wallet Security**\n\n*Not Your Keys, Not your Coins*\n\nThe blockchain is immutable and there's never been a recorded case of someone cracking a private key. A corollary of that is if you don't have the private key the blockchain isn't going take an action on your behalf regardless of how many guns the US government has or whatever a judge says. People have found themselves on the wrong side of this when they leave funds in the possession of companies only to find that the company loses those funds or stops its services. The most famous example is probably Mt Gox which is both the name of an exchange and an event. Having not learned this the first time, many people in 2022 suddenly found their funds locked again when Blockfi and Gemini suddenly stopped withdrawals. When that happened, what could else could strangers from the internet say to you? You gave someone else your money and then complained it was gone. There was no getting your funds back so all strangers on the internet could do for you was echo this timeless advice: *Not your keys, not your coins*.\n\n*Use a Hardware Wallet*\n\nEvery once in awhile a virus ripples across the internet and will manage to patch wallet software or scan computers for wallet files and transmit them over the internet. A hardware wallet is just a separate device that holds your private key and signs messages so that even if your wallet software is compromised your funds aren't affected until take a physical action to confirm a transaction. They aren't going to protect you from social engineering or certain attacks that modify the transactions sent to the hardware wallet but they are absolutely worth using. Even without a technical reason, friction between you and your private key can be useful so you have time to process what is going on before giving a private key to someone trying to phish you. When we see someone online tell us that their wallet magically emptied it's usually either that they stored their private key on something like Google Drive and then their Google account was compromised or they were using a hot wallet. In either case, people just shake their head and say you should have *used a hardware wallet*.\n\n*Send a Test Transaction First*\n\nOne of the most harrowing and unforgivable initial experiences everyone has with a blockchain is a \"simple send\" from an exchange. You fill out some form with a basically inscrutable long hash, your money shows as gone from the exchange or your wallet, and then... silence. This period where the block hasn't been confirmed or you're waiting on a receiving exchange to pick up on it and send you an email is gut-wrenching and frankly I have no idea how we all accepted this as the norm. It's embarrassing that exchanges don't directly interact with wallet software to form the transaction and verify it on their end before submitting it to the chain. Nevertheless, that's where we're at.\n\nThere are attackers who generate wallets with similar addresses to ones you own. They'll even \"dust attack\" you with some tiny amount of funds your address so their address will appear in a short list when you fill out the send form. You can simply mis-key something and replace a character somewhere. An OS virus can replace the send address in your clipboard. A malicious wallet software can replace the send address in the transaction before sending it to your hardware wallet. There's just a lot of things that can go wrong with this model. A test transaction limits the amount of money you can lose. Most of these attack vectors will steal the test transaction funds and reveal the vulnerability when they do so. Yes this costs some extra gas and tax accounting headache but if you want peace of mind whenever you're doing a send or interacting with a contract for the first time *send a test transaction first*.\n\n*Never Sign Something You Don't Understand*\n\nThere's an unfortunate pattern developing lately where websites ask you to \"sign in\" with your wallet before they'll function. This isn't the same as \"unlocking\" your wallet. Signing a message requires your private key and therefore should be something you pay careful attention to. Doing this just to sign into a website discourages vigilance which is why I think it's an unfortunate pattern.\n\nIt used to be widely understood that signing a message was harmless and that only signing transactions could harm you but increasingly this isn't true. There's something called permit2 that certain tokens support which enables token approvals from signed messages. There are more \"gasless\" services like CowSwap every year that use signed messages to direct their service to sign transactions which pull your funds and do something with it. There is something called account abstraction which just means someone else pays for your gas. Pretty much any account abstraction approach is going to use signed messages unless an EIP changes this in the future. So don't think of messages as harmless; it's outdated.\n\nAny wallet worth using these days will show you some a simulation of what the transaction you are about to sign will do given the current chain state. Obviously if it shows you all your money leaving your address that's suspicious. But a signed message can't be simulated by your wallet and so it can appear innocuous even if it is later used to form a transaction that rugs you.\n\nA message that says \"I'm signing into website blah blah blah, here's a unique hash\" is almost certainly safe. A message that has an array of values that you don't understand is not. Whenever you see a transaction calling a function you don't understand or a message you can't immediately make sense of, reject it by default and then investigate after. If it pops up again automatically it's almost certainly a scam. *Never sign something you don't understand.*\n\n*Don't Interact with Tokens you Don't Know*\n\nSometimes you'll see tokens appear in your wallet that you don't recognize. This can be for spam reasons. For example the token description will be like \"Come to my scam website https://scam-url.com.\" The scammer wants your first instinct to either be \"hey! free money!\" or \"how do I just get rid of this thing?\"\n\nRather than worrying about how to sell the token itself or get it off your address, instead switch to a wallet software that doesn't even display those tokens. At the very least most portfolio viewers rank by value and these tokens will show as 0 value. However, nothing is stopping the creator from making a Dex pool only they can trade into to give the token an apparent value to the price oracle. The only scalable solution is to use a wallet solution or portfolio viewer that has a curated whitelist of tokens and allows you to add tokens you want to this default list. On that front I'd recommend Zerion or Rabby if you're playing on the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNo good will come from any attempt to interact with the token itself. Mostly you will just waste gas trying to send it away and the transaction will just fail. However, if you so much as read the description the scammer already got your attention. That's more than they deserved. The worst case is you actually go to the scam website and sign something completely unrelated to that token and lose a lot more than gas. Either way, no good will come from your interacting with it. *Don't interact with tokens you don't know.*\n\n*Use a Cold Storage Wallet*\n\nThis one is less common than the rest but I have seen this advice a few times over the years and it came up when I asked for crowd wisdom for this post. Formally, hot wallets are any wallet where there is a network connection between the private key and the internet. Practically, there's some wiggle room here. Personally, I consider a wallet a hot wallet if the private key is on the same device as whatever UI is forming the transaction to be signed. This makes something like a Grid+ Lattice a cold wallet even though it has a wireless connection.\n\nSo what is a cold storage wallet? It's a cold wallet without any approvals. The only thing the cold storage wallet should do is push and receive assets from a cold wallet. It doesn't need to sign messages. It doesn't need to interact with the web browser in any way. It can do this entirely from within your wallet software and can and should be a multi-sig on a completely separate device that you don't browse the web with.\n\nThe advantage of this is similar to test transactions. This strategy became particularly relevant when NFT collection contracts came onto the scene. Scammers would phish a token approval for your entire collection and sweep all your NFTs at once even though you were only trying to sell one of them. Using this strategy makes you deliberately put assets at risk before interacting with them. A single errant token approval can usually take your whole stack. Using this strategy it can only take what you deliberately put on the cold wallet. It is a PITA but if you actually have generational wealth in crypto sooner or later you should be serious about this and *use a cold storage wallet.*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The next section of my Rabbit Hole Explorer&#39;s Guide is a survival guide full of stuff all of you should already know.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto Wilderness Guide</p>\n\n<p>Here are some lessons, inked in blood, that you should learn.

A malicious wallet software can replace the send address in the transaction before sending it to your hardware wallet. There&#39;s just a lot of things that can go wrong with this model. A test transaction limits the amount of money you can lose. Most of these attack vectors will steal the test transaction funds and reveal the vulnerability when they do so. Yes this costs some extra gas and tax accounting headache but if you want peace of mind whenever you&#39;re doing a send or interacting with a contract for the first time <em>send a test transaction first</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Never Sign Something You Don&#39;t Understand</em></p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s an unfortunate pattern developing lately where websites ask you to &quot;sign in&quot; with your wallet before they&#39;ll function. This isn&#39;t the same as &quot;unlocking&quot; your wallet. Signing a message requires your private key and therefore should be something you pay careful attention to. Doing this just to sign into a website discourages vigilance which is why I think it&#39;s an unfortunate pattern.</p>\n\n<p>It used to be widely understood that signing a message was harmless and that only signing transactions could harm you but increasingly this isn&#39;t true. There&#39;s something called permit2 that certain tokens support which enables token approvals from signed messages. There are more &quot;gasless&quot; services like CowSwap every year that use signed messages to direct their service to sign transactions which pull your funds and do something with it. There is something called account abstraction which just means someone else pays for your gas. Pretty much any account abstraction approach is going to use signed messages unless an EIP changes this in the future. So don&#39;t think of messages as harmless; it&#39;s outdated.</p>\n\n<p>Any wallet worth using these days will show you some a simulation of what the transaction you are about to sign will do given the current chain state. Obviously if it shows you all your money leaving your address that&#39;s suspicious. But a signed message can&#39;t be simulated by your wallet and so it can appear innocuous even if it is later used to form a transaction that rugs you.</p>\n\n<p>A message that says &quot;I&#39;m signing into website blah blah blah, here&#39;s a unique hash&quot; is almost certainly safe. A message that has an array of values that you don&#39;t understand is not. Whenever you see a transaction calling a function you don&#39;t understand or a message you can&#39;t immediately make sense of, reject it by default and then investigate after. If it pops up again automatically it&#39;s almost certainly a scam. <em>Never sign something you don&#39;t understand.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Don&#39;t Interact with Tokens you Don&#39;t Know</em></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes you&#39;ll see tokens appear in your wallet that you don&#39;t recognize. This can be for spam reasons. For example the token description will be like &quot;Come to my scam website <a href=\"https://scam-url.com.\">https://scam-url.com.</a>&quot; The scammer wants your first instinct to either be &quot;hey! free money!&quot; or &quot;how do I just get rid of this thing?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Rather than worrying about how to sell the token itself or get it off your address, instead switch to a wallet software that doesn&#39;t even display those tokens. At the very least most portfolio viewers rank by value and these tokens will show as 0 value. However, nothing is stopping the creator from making a Dex pool only they can trade into to give the token an apparent value to the price oracle. The only scalable solution is to use a wallet solution or portfolio viewer that has a curated whitelist of tokens and allows you to add tokens you want to this default list. On that front I&#39;d recommend Zerion or Rabby if you&#39;re playing on the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>No good will come from any attempt to interact with the token itself. Mostly you will just waste gas trying to send it away and the transaction will just fail. However, if you so much as read the description the scammer already got your attention. That&#39;s more than they deserved. The worst case is you actually go to the scam website and sign something completely unrelated to that token and lose a lot more than gas. Either way, no good will come from your interacting with it. <em>Don&#39;t interact with tokens you don&#39;t know.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Use a Cold Storage Wallet</em></p>\n\n<p>This one is less common than the rest but I have seen this advice a few times over the years and it came up when I asked for crowd wisdom for this post. Formally, hot wallets are any wallet where there is a network connection between the private key and the internet. Practically, there&#39;s some wiggle room here. Personally, I consider a wallet a hot wallet if the private key is on the same device as whatever UI is forming the transaction to be signed. This makes something like a Grid+ Lattice a cold wallet even though it has a wireless connection.</p>\n\n<p>So what is a cold storage wallet? It&#39;s a cold wallet without any approvals. The only thing the cold storage wallet should do is push and receive assets from a cold wallet. It doesn&#39;t need to sign messages. It doesn&#39;t need to interact with the web browser in any way. It can do this entirely from within your wallet software and can and should be a multi-sig on a completely separate device that you don&#39;t browse the web with.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of this is similar to test transactions. This strategy became particularly relevant when NFT collection contracts came onto the scene. Scammers would phish a token approval for your entire collection and sweep all your NFTs at once even though you were only trying to sell one of them. Using this strategy makes you deliberately put assets at risk before interacting with them. A single errant token approval can usually take your whole stack. Using this strategy it can only take what you deliberately put on the cold wallet. It is a PITA but if you actually have generational wealth in crypto sooner or later you should be serious about this and <em>use a cold storage wallet.</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-06-10 15:30:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"l8168fk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1dcdm7q","parent_id":"t3_1dcdm7q","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/sm3gh34d","body":"Some of this advice is very EOA centric.

'There's a problem? We get attacked? We we go offline for 24 hours and come back, no big deal. It's not worth all this effort to prevent.'\n\n\nIf we get true, widescale adoption (RWA, stable coin payments, stocks, web3, etc), this is an irresponsible take. Or perhaps more accurately, we won't get widescale adoption with these types of takes.\n\n\nBusinesses don't *want* to go offline, but it's a part of life right now they are forced to deal with; we should be aiming to fix massive outages as tech gets better.
