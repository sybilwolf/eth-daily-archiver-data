The upgrade is explained in this [**medium post**](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-houston-launch-b056ca1a6c10), but I'm going to give you a summary of what is included in the upgrade. I'll explain to you how Houston is going to make Rocket Pool an even better staking service than it is now.\n\nHouston is going to include two big areas of upgrades. The first is related to its governance, and the second is related to how staking is set up on the network. Let's talk about the onchain voting system first.\n\nWhen Rocket Pool's oDAO voted to take a 90% pay cut last year, it was the removal of a huge area of FUD around the protocol. However, one piece of FUD remained - the team's control of the guardian wallet. This was a wallet that manages the protocol treasury, and it can also edit parameters at the protocol level. This wallet is controlled by the Rocket Pool team who use those powers to make changes based on community votes. With Houston, most of that power is going away from the team, and it's coming into the hands of the Rocket Pool community (its pDAO).\n\nOnchain voting for Rocket Pool is incredibly complicated because it of how votes are weighted. You only get voting power if you're a Node Operator (NO) with an effective staked balance of RPL. There's no other protocol in all of crypto that has a system like this, and there's no one you can buy a solution like this from, so it was all designed from scratch. There were technical and conceptual issues along the way, which is why the process has taken so long. The result, however, is that the guardian wallet will come into the control of the community instead of the team. This will make Rocket Pool take a huge step towards being a maximally decentralized protocol.\n\nThe second major part of the upgrade is a set of features that together will impact staking on Rocket Pool. These are the features of being able to stake ETH on behalf of a node and having a separate RPL withdrawal address. Currently, Rocket Pool allows stake RPL on behalf of a node and has an ETH withdrawal address. The new features will fill out the configurations and allow setups to make staking more flexible. Currently, to stake with Rocket Pool, you need to be the NO, hold the ETH, and hold the RPL. Sadly, there aren't enough people in the world who have all three of those attributes. With the changes in Houston, you'll be able to enter into protocol level configurations where all these stakeholders can be separated in a trust minimized way. The impact of this is that we'll have a new path to institutional whale marriages built into the protocol, and we'll have the foundations for staking services (such as NodeSet) to be built on top of Rocket Pool.\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation about the institutional level whale marriages coming into Rocket Pool in the days and weeks after Houston. If things work out the way the community expects, you could potentially see tens of thousands of ETH coming into the protocol because of this. With NodeSet's launch in around 3 months time, that number could go up to the hundreds of thousands of ETH.\n\nI recorded an [**interview with Kane Wallman**](https://youtu.be/fcqUyInHIng), Rocket Pool's senior solidity engineer, who did the bulk of the work on these upgrades. The interview was released this morning. In the interview, Kane talks about some of the technical and conceptual difficulties with getting these upgrades out. We also look talk about the changes coming in the Saturn upgrade and how it will be Rocket Pool 2.0.
