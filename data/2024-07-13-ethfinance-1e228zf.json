Over the last month I got slightly over 11% annualized return for my staked GNO. This is about 3-4 times as much as my ETH validators do. In addition I receive execution fee rewards in xDAI, this was around 1-2% additional rewards annualized, but has become negligible over the last few weeks. A single validator costs 1 GNO which is about 265$ currently. A single validator in itself is not worth it from a pure monetary reward as you only get around 2.5$ per month for it. GNO tokens also have a very different monetary policy around it. EIP-1559 on gnosis chain burns xDAI tokens and not GNO. They are thinking of buying back and burn GNO tokens with the excess DAI they have on their bridge due to the xDAI on the gnosis chain side being burnt by EIP-1559, but nothing has been decided yet. GNO itself is an ERC-20 token used for staking on gnosis chain and voting in the gnosis DAO. They do use the GNO token as well in AMMs in pools with their incubated projects. The idea is that this will let GNO holders participate in the growth of their whole ecosystem. All in all GNO tokens are a very different thing than what ETH is. I consider holding GNO to be more risky than holding ETH. Over the last year it has outperformed ETH, but I would not bet too much on it that this will still be the case in the future. And looking at a several years time scale it has stayed in a range with a slightly downwards trajectory versus ETH. So, if you want to validate on gnosis chain to make more ETH it definitely is a high risk play. It might work out or not.\n\nI personally started because I wanted to help secure my precious POAPs which live on gnosis chain. I then used my gnosis validators to experiment more with client diversity and general node tweaks. And now I am staying there for developments and apps the gnosis ecosystem is pushing. For example, I use the gnosis pay card regularly which I automatically refill with my gnosis chain staking rewards using poweragents as automatic contract executors. I recently started a few more validators just for the launch of the shutterized beacon chain on gnosis which I think is a great way to tackle malicious MEV. If successfull this might come to the Ethereum beacon chain at some point as well. I also love the gnosis chain discord. The people there are generally quite nice and helpful and the moderators are just great. The gnosis team also pushes heavily for decentralization of their validator set by incentivizing solo stakers and stakers in underrepresented countries. It seems to work out surprisingly well, as the percentage of solo stakers is rather large and there are not that many institutional stakers and LSTs. \n\nTLDR: From a pure monetary perspective staking on gnosis chain might or might not be worth it, depending on what your goal is. I personally love the projects they have on gnosis chain and regularly use them. That is why I also validate the chain.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes, I do.

And looking at a several years time scale it has stayed in a range with a slightly downwards trajectory versus ETH. So, if you want to validate on gnosis chain to make more ETH it definitely is a high risk play. It might work out or not.</p>\n\n<p>I personally started because I wanted to help secure my precious POAPs which live on gnosis chain. I then used my gnosis validators to experiment more with client diversity and general node tweaks. And now I am staying there for developments and apps the gnosis ecosystem is pushing. For example, I use the gnosis pay card regularly which I automatically refill with my gnosis chain staking rewards using poweragents as automatic contract executors. I recently started a few more validators just for the launch of the shutterized beacon chain on gnosis which I think is a great way to tackle malicious MEV. If successfull this might come to the Ethereum beacon chain at some point as well. I also love the gnosis chain discord. The people there are generally quite nice and helpful and the moderators are just great. The gnosis team also pushes heavily for decentralization of their validator set by incentivizing solo stakers and stakers in underrepresented countries. It seems to work out surprisingly well, as the percentage of solo stakers is rather large and there are not that many institutional stakers and LSTs. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: From a pure monetary perspective staking on gnosis chain might or might not be worth it, depending on what your goal is. I personally love the projects they have on gnosis chain and regularly use them. That is why I also validate the chain.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-13 14:14:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ld1nbdf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1e228zf","parent_id":"t1_ld0onvd","score":24,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KaiserMerkle","body":"Appreciate these writeups a lot.
