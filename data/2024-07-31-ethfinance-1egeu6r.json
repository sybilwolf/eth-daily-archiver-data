The crypto space excluding ETH (and in my opinion LINK) seems to be totally divorced from reasonable valuations, with memes like Doge worth $18B. We are absolutely not early for <strong><em>retail</em></strong>, but it&#39;s interesting how the podcast argues we could be early for <strong><em>tradfi</em></strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>On ZK and privacy being Ethereum&#39;s transformative moment, it had me thinking - is it possible to create a private L2 that can interact with the public L1? So for example I&#39;ll have no idea what transactions are happening on the L2 and people can trade on &quot;privateswap&quot;, but I could see that 10 ETH and 100 tokenized AAPL shares were bridged back to Ethereum address 0x123abc...</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-07-31 09:21:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lfu13a0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1egeu6r","parent_id":"t1_lft2ka9","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pa7x1","body":"Regarding 2. That's what EY Nightfall does, for instance. It's a zk Optimistic rollup. Where the first zk identifies that the rollup uses zero-knowledge proofs for privacy but is an optimistic rollup like Arbitrum and Optimism. So yes, it's possible.\n\nIt's also possible that the rollup will be a fully permissioned Validium that uses zk validity proofs. So the content of the transactions is fully offchain and private, perhaps held only by the rollup operator (e.g. BlackRock) but publishes zk-proofs to Ethereum. That would also allow privacy while enabling the composability discussed above.\n\nRegarding 1. I think the recent past is giving us a distorted view of Ethereum's economic fundamentals, because it just released a shit-ton of blockspace scalability and this has depressed blockspace prices. Ethereum's blockspace pricing is based on EIP-1559, which is very aggressive in its price adjustments. It uses an exponential adjustment, this is good for very quickly pricing bursts of demand. But if blockspace capacity is above demand, it sends prices of blockspace to 0. \n\nWith the release of Dencun upgrade we went from having capacity for 15 tps to having 30x that over night (around 500ish tps). Until we start saturating additional capacity the price of blockspace is basically free. The good news is that we are getting there quite quick. Already doing more than 300 tps daily just a few months after. When we start to saturate a fee market will start to develop. So looking at Ethereum's current economic fundamental figures and extrapolating further can be quite misguiding, Ethereum is giving up its product for free at the moment to entice demand.\n\nSuper quick back of the envelope math, just to get a taste of the numbers. Feel free to tweak the assumptions as you see fit. With current blobspace target of 3 blobs (1 shard):\n\n500 tps x 60 x 60 x 24 x 365 secs per year = 15800M transactions per year\n\nSay average transaction fee is 5 cents. Which would make the median even lower, around 1-2 cents. Making even the lowest added value use cases (e.g. pay for coffee) perfectly viable. This is likely extremely conservative because if we start having serious financial applications on top of Ethereum (i.e. tokenized RWA) those fees are ridiculously low. Your broker charges you easily 5 USD per transaction. And registration of car titles, houses, etc... is even more expensive. So it could push the average much higher easily.\n\n15800M tx per year x 0.05 USD per tx = 800M USD per year\n\nSay Ethereum captures 80% of that. This assumption is based on the current burn %, which has typically floated around 80% of the tx cost (this is the trickiest assumption, feel free to change it). 640M USD per year with 1 shard. \n\nWith full danksharding we will go up to 64 shards. So that would puts of the order of 40B USD per year of burn just from blobspace. That gives you an implied price of ETH of 33K USD just from blobspace alone. Add to that Ethereum's proper blockspace which in the past has been able to capture a similar figure of burn and you get to a price of ETH around 50K to 100K USD.\n\nMind you, this is a long-termish view of the roadmap. It will take us still years to deliver Danksharding and 64 shards and onboard all the use cases. \n\nThis ignores any monetary premium ETH could capture. For instance, Bitcoin would be worth 0 if we were to value it based on its cash flows as done above, yet it's not. Because it has some monetary premium derived from its scarcity. Ethereum is arguably scarcer than Bitcoin, although the market has not still appreciated this. In around 3 halvings, Bitcoin's security budget will be so eroded (reduction by 90%) that there will be discussions of changing its issuance and therefore destroying the 21M meme.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Regarding 2.
