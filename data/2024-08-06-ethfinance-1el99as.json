But in the following days or weeks, you will feel the urge to get back in, maybe slowly at first, in an effort to make back what you've lost. This urge gets stronger when you see the ratio recover and mentally image what you would have made had you not been liquidated. You need to constantly block those thoughts for your own sake. Find a distraction. If you get back in, during this mentally vulnerable period, on the days after a crash where the price is volatile AF, you will lose money faster and maybe completely. It does not matter if you are a good trader or not, because you just can't think rationally right now. In my experience, you should stay logged off for at least a month.\n\n-The best thing you can do is stay out of leverage completely and forever. Spot trading earns you way less, but its \"profits/stress\" ratio (I just coined the term) is a thousand times higher... as is its \"profits/time wasted staring on a screen\" ratio. You won't feel like a pro with some nights winning what you can in three months of spot trading, but you will feel better five years down the line.\n\nTake a break, go for long walks, and reevaluate your goals. You still have a lot of ETH, more than some of us can ever dream of having, and if the network achieves even a tenth of what we Ethereans believe it can achieve, you have generational wealth.\n\nGood luck!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I can relate, so please here me out.

Then I *did* actually get liquidated on Liquity in 2021 (because I didn't understand then that Liquity's 110% LTV threshold can become 150% at times of high market stress - I sure as hell learned that through bitter experience). \n\nThe Liquity loss was quite a lot in terms of what I have now, but 2021 was good enough to me that I was mostly able to shrug it off at that time. It stung, but that's it. \n\nI also have lost scary amounts of money (both cold hard realized losses and opportunity cost of losing out on ETH gains by getting into some altcoin) in trading alts. \n\nBut my biggest mistakes though were in simply *not taking profits* at least three separate times when I let greed get the better of me and threw away truly lifechanging amounts of money (DeFi Summer and the two peaks in 2021). Especially the last one in Nov 2021 when I could have cashed out even 10% of my stack and had life changing money and still had 90% of it left to play with if it kept going up. I literally remember sitting in my office reading Arthur Hayes' piece about how the Fed was signalling it would raise rates in early 2022 and we should derisk now - and I remember getting up and walking out to go for dinner instead of doing anything. I didn't even need to sell for cash - even if I had simply taken my ETH out of my CDP and closed the CDP and stopped leveraging up, I'd have kept most of it - instead, I rode the leverage a lot of the way down and lost a lot of the ETH I had, and then lost a lot more trading into alts in 2022 trying to make it back.  \n\nThat moment  I ignored the Hayes article will probably haunt me forever - I still think about it almost every day. I still love Ethereum and there's still a feeling of \"OMG, this is so cool\" every time I click approve on my Ledger and do something that I could never do in TradFi - I never lost that.

Leaving aside the original decision to get into crypto (and then finding ethtrader and Ethereum) and the sheer pigheadedness to stick around in crypto and not leave, I made 99% of my profits and 2021 net worth based on two good and lucky decisions (mostly luck frankly) - one ICO I blindly aped into in 2018, and then deciding to leverage up on ETH in a CDP at exactly the right time during DeFi Summer when it was $400. That's it. Everything else was basically just noise. \n\nThe reverse is also true - 3-4 (I still cringe when typing that out) missed opportunities to sell the top and a couple of very bad alt investment decisions that I held for too long (TOKE - I'm looking at you going from $58 to sub $1 - although I did get out at $6) led to me losing the vast majority of my 2021 stack. \n\nBut anyway I don't have any easy answers for you - just wanted to share to show that there are people who understand exactly how you feel. It still stings like hell and I still can't bring myself to calculate *exactly* how much ETH I had at my peak (taking into account altcoin and CDP holdings etc). But my sheer bloody mindedness won't let me quit and I recently liquidated some other (non crypto) assets and went all in on ETH and a few select alts in April (\"all-in\" by 2024 standards - would be a laughably small amount compared to what I was playing with in 2021). \n\nI still believe, and still think I will do well (and most importantly I am trying not to make the same mistakes again) but I'm never getting my 2021 net worth again.
