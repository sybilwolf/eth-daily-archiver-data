This is all well and good....assuming the price of eth stops going down the second the liquidation occurs and you get to buy the collateral at a discount to spot.

For those of you who don't know, the community is proposing that Rocket Pool remove the requirement for RPL staking as a collateral alongside your ETH stake. RPL value will be maintained by turning on the fee switch. People who stake RPL alongside their ETH will get boosted ETH rewards. \n\nAfter many months of ideation, deliberation, and refinement, the new tokenomics proposal has reached the stage where [the community votes on it](https://vote.rocketpool.net/#/proposal/0xb0e1c82fdf83f31de7b8f84767a092fddfb21abb71d81ea3aeec9acdcf43902d). Within 24 hours, quorum has been reached, and the vote is 99.4% in favor of adopting the new tokenomics. The level of support is frankly overwhelming. The community really wants this. \n\nThere are some outstanding questions that will need to go to vote in the coming months. However, the official roadmap for Rocket Pool for the Saturn upgrade (due q1-q2 '25) will now include ETH only validators, having 4 ETH bonds (instead of 8 ETH as we currently have and 1.5 ETH later), and a fee switch for RPL. \n\nYou might think, that's cool and all but that's a long way away. You might ask, what is Rocket Pool doing now? Well, this is the really exciting part. The Rocket Pool grants committee funded a project called \"Rocket Lend\". It will allow people who are under collateralized on their RPL, or new node operators who don't have RPL, to borrow RPL in order to add it to their stake. It's an RPL lending service! Using this will not have the risk of liquidation like borrowing RPL from Aave does, and you won't need collateral to use the project meaning more of your ETH can be staked. Audits for that will start soon, and mainnet launch is targeted in 3 months.\n\nThere's also serious discussion taking place in the community about ETH only validators coming much much sooner through some fairly simple smart contract tweaks and a new method for calculating rewards. This could happen within 3 months. We also have NodeSet launching in around 4 months time which will let you deposit your ETH or RPL and earn rewards on that. Some of you can become node operators with NodeSet to boost your income significantly. \n\nThese changes have been in the works for a long time, but we're getting close to the point where the fruits of the labor will start to show. It might be worth it for you to have another look at Rocket Pool and see if becoming a node operator makes more sense for you now that it did before. \n\nAs always, let me know if you have any questions, and I'll do my best to answer them.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I have an exciting update from Rocket Pool Land! </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve written about the community proposed tokenomics updates to Rocket Pool a bunch of times here.

Such a project would require a multifaceted approach involving blockchain technology, AI, and community engagement. Here\u2019s a detailed exploration of how this could be accomplished:\n\n### Concept and Objectives\n\n1. **Objective**: Develop an Ethereum-based DApp that leverages AI to detect and counter misinformation on social media platforms like Twitter. The DApp would be funded by the community using ETH, creating a sustainable and decentralized model for managing information integrity.\n\n2. **Components**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **AI Algorithm**: A machine learning model trained to detect misinformation and provide fact-checked responses.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Ethereum Smart Contracts**: To manage payments, rewards, and operational logistics.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Community Governance**: Ensuring the community has a say in how the DApp operates, potentially through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).\n\n### Technical Architecture\n\n1. **AI for Misinformation Detection and Countering**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Data Collection**: Gather data from Twitter and other social media platforms to train the AI. This involves historical data of known misinformation and factual content.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Model Training**: Use supervised learning techniques to train the AI model to recognize patterns of misinformation and generate accurate, verifiable responses.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enhance the AI's ability to understand and generate human-like text.\n\n2. **Ethereum Smart Contracts**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Payment System**: Users can pay ETH to activate the AI service. The smart contract would handle payments, ensuring transparency and security.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Incentive Mechanism**: Reward users who report misinformation and provide accurate information. This could be through a token incentive or ETH rewards.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Governance**: Implement a DAO to allow the community to vote on important decisions, such as changes to the AI model, funding allocations, and other operational aspects.\n\n### Steps to Development\n\n1. **Define Requirements and Objectives**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Specify the exact functionalities of the AI and the DApp.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Identify the target audience and potential users within the Ethereum community.\n\n2. **Develop the AI Model**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Collect and preprocess training data.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Train the AI model using advanced NLP techniques.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Continuously update the model with new data to improve accuracy.\n\n3. **Build the Ethereum DApp**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Develop smart contracts for payment processing and governance.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Integrate the AI model with the DApp backend.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Ensure security measures are in place to protect user data and funds.\n\n4. **Testing and Iteration**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Conduct thorough testing of the AI model and DApp.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Gather feedback from a small group of beta testers.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Iterate and improve based on feedback.\n\n5. **Launch and Community Engagement**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Launch the DApp to the Ethereum community.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Promote the DApp through community channels and encourage participation.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Establish a feedback loop to continuously improve the service.\n\n### Potential Challenges and Considerations\n\n1. **Accuracy of AI**: Ensuring the AI model is accurate and can reliably distinguish between misinformation and factual information is crucial. Regular updates and community feedback will be essential.\n\n2. **Scalability**: The DApp should be able to handle a large number of transactions and interactions, which can be challenging given the current scalability issues on the Ethereum network.\n\n3. **Governance and Decentralization**: Creating a fair and transparent governance model that involves the community while maintaining operational efficiency can be complex.\n\n4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Addressing potential legal and ethical concerns related to misinformation, free speech, and data privacy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBuilding a DApp on Ethereum to counter misinformation on Crypto Twitter is feasible and could greatly benefit the Ethereum community. By leveraging AI for misinformation detection and employing decentralized governance, the community can create a sustainable and effective solution. This project would not only improve the quality of information on social media but also reinforce the Ethereum community\u2019s commitment to transparency and accuracy.\n\nDeveloping such a DApp would require collaboration among developers, AI specialists, and the Ethereum community, but it holds the promise of transforming how misinformation is managed in the crypto space.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ran this idea through ChatGPT to layout a blueprint hoping there is a Hayden Adams-esque community member here up to the challenge:</p>\n\n<p>Creating a decentralized application (DApp) on Ethereum to counter misinformation on Crypto Twitter (CT) is a compelling idea.

This could be through a token incentive or ETH rewards.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- <strong>Governance</strong>: Implement a DAO to allow the community to vote on important decisions, such as changes to the AI model, funding allocations, and other operational aspects.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Steps to Development</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Define Requirements and Objectives</strong>:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Specify the exact functionalities of the AI and the DApp.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Identify the target audience and potential users within the Ethereum community.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Develop the AI Model</strong>:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Collect and preprocess training data.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Train the AI model using advanced NLP techniques.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Continuously update the model with new data to improve accuracy.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Build the Ethereum DApp</strong>:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Develop smart contracts for payment processing and governance.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Integrate the AI model with the DApp backend.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Ensure security measures are in place to protect user data and funds.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Testing and Iteration</strong>:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Conduct thorough testing of the AI model and DApp.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Gather feedback from a small group of beta testers.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Iterate and improve based on feedback.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Launch and Community Engagement</strong>:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Launch the DApp to the Ethereum community.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Promote the DApp through community channels and encourage participation.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Establish a feedback loop to continuously improve the service.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Potential Challenges and Considerations</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Accuracy of AI</strong>: Ensuring the AI model is accurate and can reliably distinguish between misinformation and factual information is crucial. Regular updates and community feedback will be essential.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: The DApp should be able to handle a large number of transactions and interactions, which can be challenging given the current scalability issues on the Ethereum network.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Governance and Decentralization</strong>: Creating a fair and transparent governance model that involves the community while maintaining operational efficiency can be complex.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Legal and Ethical Considerations</strong>: Addressing potential legal and ethical concerns related to misinformation, free speech, and data privacy.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>Building a DApp on Ethereum to counter misinformation on Crypto Twitter is feasible and could greatly benefit the Ethereum community. By leveraging AI for misinformation detection and employing decentralized governance, the community can create a sustainable and effective solution. This project would not only improve the quality of information on social media but also reinforce the Ethereum community\u2019s commitment to transparency and accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>Developing such a DApp would require collaboration among developers, AI specialists, and the Ethereum community, but it holds the promise of transforming how misinformation is managed in the crypto space.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-08 03:46:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lh35fiq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1emxgi7","parent_id":"t1_lh312ok","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/o-_l_-o","body":"I think the best way to combat FUD is to build a single Ethereum usecase that people actually want to use.
