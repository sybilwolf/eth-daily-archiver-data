You cannot delay arbitrarily posting your proofs in the regime where demand for blockspace outstrips total blockspace capacity.\n\nThis is only possible when on average over an extended period of time (say 1 day, 1 week) total generalized blockspace (i.e. compressed blockspace through blobs + L1 blockspace) is greater than demand for settlement. As it is today. Then you can dampen the bursts of overdemand by delaying and spreading out. But once demand outstrips the availability of generalized blockspace the delay strategy doesn't work. It's really that simple, when demand for blockspace outstrips capacity a fee market will develop.

And if people could pay to jump the queue a fee market would develop. But shoppers can also notice that the rest of the day is quite empty and will start spreading their shopping times. This strategy works until the total daily demand matches the daily throughput of the supermarket. Once total shoppers visiting in a day exceed the total daily throughput of the supermarket it will always have a fee market because there is no point in time at which you can delay your visit.

His complete lack of discussion around Ethereum (either in speeches or platform) has me concerned the lobbying is going to be what benefits Bitcoin and not the rest of this space. \n\n2) I'm not, nor have I ever argued the Democratic platform is more pro-crypto. I've openly criticized actions Dems have taken and have even said that Kamala's lack of a stance is a letdown. I've criticized both sides for their lack of legislation that has bogged down innovation.

SAB 121 was bipartisian, (yes, Biden vetod it, yes I&#39;m not happy either). The democratically led SEC passed an ETH ETF with no lawsuit after what seemed to be clear pressure from the Dems. The Senates Dem majority leader has spoken positively about crypto. All things that you ignore in favor of generalities like Dems being anti freedoms (even though, again, it was Trump&#39;s appointee who wanted to increase reporting for unhosted wallets).</p>\n\n<p>You are asking what my point it. I&#39;m tired of having to keep stating it. </p>\n\n<p>1) It&#39;s clear to me Trump&#39;s stance on the blockchain industry is surface-level at best. It&#39;s very Bitcoin centric and while there are crypto-positive stances I appreciate I don&#39;t see any indication this is a major issue for him. It has a strong &quot;hey, here is a group of people who will give me money&quot; vibe and while I&#39;m fully aware that is politics / fundraising / lobbying, my underlying concern is the names &amp; groups getting in his ear. His complete lack of discussion around Ethereum (either in speeches or platform) has me concerned the lobbying is going to be what benefits Bitcoin and not the rest of this space. </p>\n\n<p>2) I&#39;m not, nor have I ever argued the Democratic platform is more pro-crypto. I&#39;ve openly criticized actions Dems have taken and have even said that Kamala&#39;s lack of a stance is a letdown. I&#39;ve criticized both sides for their lack of legislation that has bogged down innovation. What I&#39;ve tried my best to make it clear that I don&#39;t agree with everyone who comes here and acts like Republicans and Democrats have this chasm between them on the issues that are so often repeated. Republican&#39;s track record here isn&#39;t squeaky clean, and Democrats have done more positive then what people give credit for</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-08-27 05:39:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lk5zpqi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1f1g6p2","parent_id":"t1_lk5ofls","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/sm3gh34d","body":"holy shit.
