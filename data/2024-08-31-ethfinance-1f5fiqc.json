I don't drink either independently, I put it into stuff, and that stuff in question ends up containing bananas and dark chocolate at roughly equal frequencies (usually both)\n\n----\n\n* **Q**: Do you have any heuristic for when compromises to decentralized principles go too far for stablecoins?\n* **Vit**: My main worry is when they start entrenching network effects that become hard to undo. For example, if we start normalizing \"sign in to this crypto social thing with Google\", I think that's really bad, UNLESS it's done in an account-abstraction way where under the hood it's using zk-email and individual users can sign in with their ethereum account instead (and convert their account from one to the other). This way, it's not entrenching network effects of centralized web2 platforms, it's actually creating a bridge that lets users join the ecosystem with them, but then more easily migrate away from them.\n\n----\n\n* **Q**: Last TV series you watched? And if you liked it\n* **Vit**: \"Three Body Problem\" was good\n* **My opinion**: Hell yeah! Lots of Ethereum devs are \"Dark Forest\" fans due to its parallels with Ethereum MEV. Personally, I would recommend the Netflix adoption over the gigantic Chinese soap opera one, but neither series has reached the \"Dark Forest\" book yet.\n\n----\n\n* **Q**: Do you prefer \u00b0C to \u00b0F?\n* **Vit**: I prefer C, but it's a weaker preference than all the other units. I would gladly take a trade of switching to F in exchange for never hearing about either feet/miles or ounces/pounds again.\n\n----\n\n* **Q**: How can we offer decentralized access to content? Http is not good enough any more. Ipfs feels unusable when it comes to normal users (without http gateways). Thoughts?\n* **Vit**: We need browsers with IPFS integrated. Brave was supposed to be that, but unfortunately its IPFS gateway is quite slow so I never end up using it.\n* **My opinion**: Agreed. I hate how difficult and slow it is to access IPFS gateways via browser extensions. IPFS is barely accessible unless you pay for premium gateway services.\n\n----\n\n* **Q**: [Pure decentralization is overrated] Farcaster, Base, and Telegram have a decentralized foundation, but were built by centralized teams.\n* **Vit**: If the team behind Farcaster didn't build and market Warpcast, we wouldn't be here now. The use cases we want Ethereum to take on need the centralized approach to grow, but are placed on a decentralized foundation.\n* **My opinion**: Agreed. Almost nothing we do in crypto is purely decentralized, and that would be an unrealistic expectation. We would never be able trust anything on-chain without prior off-chain trust for the teams that build those protocols. That is, unless user were a senior crypto developer with code-auditing expertise, which is ridiculous requirement.\n\n----\n\n* **Q**: Do you see usdc overtaking cashapp, apple pay and the likes as a generally acceptable form of payment\n* **Vit**: I think we need to have easy to use ethereum-ecosystem-wide L2 payments first for that to happen.\n\n----\n\n\n**Source:** https://warpcast.com/vitalik.eth/0xa3ad7913","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Vitalik Buterin started an unofficial AMA last weekend on Warpcast</strong> after he posted about <a href=\"https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1827583576751181961\">stablecoin decentralization on X</a></p>\n\n<p>TL;DR of the original X post:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DEX</strong>: great</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralized Stablecoins</strong>: great</li>\n<li><strong>Polymarket</strong>: great</li>\n<li><strong>Semi-decentralized Stablecoin like USDC</strong>: Not great, but they&#39;re a practical and convenient necessity.
