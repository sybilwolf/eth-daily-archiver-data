I think that shows one more time that ETH is far ahead of its competition (if you believe that all L1s are competing, which might or might not be the case, depending on niche/ audience etc.). I don't think KS really understands MEV. It doesn't matter if we burn MEV or not, but MEV won't necessarily be captured at the base layer. Down the road apps and / or wallets will likely auction off the rights for private order flow and will share the biggest part of the proceeds with the user that created the MEV opportunity in the first place. I truly believe MEV shouldn't be and won't be a source of revenue for validators only. That was a nice narrative in 2021 (and I was a fan, it sounded so nice to get 20% APY on your validator just because of MEV, remember that bankless episode with Justin Drake?), but we are in 2024 now...
