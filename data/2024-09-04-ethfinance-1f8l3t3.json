What would be much better is if every smartphone was defacto a wallet somehow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can automate that all in app already without the smartphone upgrade problem.  You really can&#39;t get rid of the crypto key problem though.  The key has to reside somewhere and your most reasonable choices are hardware wallet, phone, and/or cloud.  </p>\n\n<p>What is a bit unsettling about the cloud option is that I can see that winning out for a lot of people because of the convenience factor.  The FIDO Alliance bent the knee on that issue in pursuit of adoption for &#39;better&#39; authentication.  I don&#39;t see how this industry will hold out either when mass adoption is at stake.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-09-04 17:55:54","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-09-04 18:09:47","id":"llk2xdp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1f8l3t3","parent_id":"t1_llk106k","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/BuyETHorDAI","body":"Personally, my choice would be the phone with a secure enclave that essentially performs the same function as a hardware wallet.
