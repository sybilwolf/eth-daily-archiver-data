If I swap ETH to EURe I get a slightly better rate than I see on coingecko for any of the large exchanges. Same with the GNO tokens.

If you want to use a one stop shop you can use jumper(dot)exchange which swaps your ETH from Ethereum to EURe on Gnosis chain. Currently you should lose 0.2% in the bridging process. You can even directly send the bridged and swapped tokens to your safe account connected to gnosis pay. If you go from a rollup from ETH to gnosis into EURe chain it currently costs you 0.6% in bridging/swap fees. There I think it makes sense to bridge raw ETH and swap manually afterwards.
