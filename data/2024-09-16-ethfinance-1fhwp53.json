If you deposit ETH you lock it into the protocol as collateral. Say for example you deposit 1 ETH and the value of that ETH is $2000 at the time of deposit. Then with that 1 ETH you decide to mint 1000 DAI. The price of DAI is always stable at 1$ so you basically took out $1000 worth of debt. \n\nAt a collateral value of $2000 and a debt position of $1000 you are 200% collateralized, i.e. the value of your collateral is 200% of the value of your debt. If the value of your ETH goes to $4000 you are now 400% collateralized. You could take out 0.5 ETH and still maintain your loan of 1000 DAI with a collateral of 200%.\nImportant to note that the ETH you deposited is always still yours, you don\u2019t lose it and you will get it all back once you pay back the loan.\n\nHowever if the price of ETH drops to $1000 you are now only 100% collateralized. This means your debt is now worth the same as your collateral. This is dangerous for the makerdao protocol because they could get in a situation where you decide to just keep the $1000 DAI and never pay it back for your ETH. Therefore the protocol doesn\u2019t allow you to come under a certain collateralization rate, I believe it\u2019s 150%. If in my example ETH drops under $1500, the protocol will automatically sell your ETH to pay back the loan. This is called liquidation. You now no longer have your ETH, just your 1000 DAI (which is now yours and not a loan anymore) and whatever is left in the protocol after selling the ETH and paying back $1000 + fees.\n\nThis resource explains it reasonably well.\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-does-makerdao-work-understanding-the-central-bank-of-crypto/\n\nThis resource explains liquidations\nhttps://medium.com/defi-saver/liquidations-in-defi-how-they-happen-and-how-to-prevent-them-9caddd52de71#:~:text=MakerDAO%20liquidations&text=Allowing%20your%20position%20to%20fall,and%20starting%20the%20liquidation%20auction.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Fyi I can see in your comment history that you replied but it\u2019s not visible here for some reason.</p>\n\n<p>There is no impermanent loss involved in this process. If you deposit ETH you lock it into the protocol as collateral. Say for example you deposit 1 ETH and the value of that ETH is $2000 at the time of deposit. Then with that 1 ETH you decide to mint 1000 DAI. The price of DAI is always stable at 1$ so you basically took out $1000 worth of debt. </p>\n\n<p>At a collateral value of $2000 and a debt position of $1000 you are 200% collateralized, i.e. the value of your collateral is 200% of the value of your debt. If the value of your ETH goes to $4000 you are now 400% collateralized. You could take out 0.5 ETH and still maintain your loan of 1000 DAI with a collateral of 200%.\nImportant to note that the ETH you deposited is always still yours, you don\u2019t lose it and you will get it all back once you pay back the loan.</p>\n\n<p>However if the price of ETH drops to $1000 you are now only 100% collateralized. This means your debt is now worth the same as your collateral. This is dangerous for the makerdao protocol because they could get in a situation where you decide to just keep the $1000 DAI and never pay it back for your ETH. Therefore the protocol doesn\u2019t allow you to come under a certain collateralization rate, I believe it\u2019s 150%. If in my example ETH drops under $1500, the protocol will automatically sell your ETH to pay back the loan. This is called liquidation.

Maybe you are shadowbanned I don\u2019t know. I suggest contacting the mods or making a new user handle.\n\nYou are correct that people that create a collateralized debt position are generally bullish. It\u2019s useful when you need some cash for expenses but don\u2019t want to sell your assets because you think they will go up. For example you want to buy a new car, but don\u2019t want to sell your ETH to have the cash to buy one. In that case you could put your ETH up as collateral and loan the money against it. If ETH does go up in the end, you don\u2019t miss out on gains. \n\nAnother way it\u2019s commonly used is during the bull market when people like to speculate on stuff onchain. If you want some liquidity to gamble on memes but dont want to sell your ETH to do it, you can take out this loan. For example I have 10 ETH worth $20k total and I want to buy $2K worth of memecoins. I could either sell 1 ETH and have 9 ETH + $2k in memecoins, or I could put my ETH up as collateral, mint $2000 DAI and buy memecoins with that. Then you have 10 ETH, $2000 worth of memes and $2000 debt. Or you could buy more ETH with the $2000 which makes you go levered long (this is what leverage is). \n\nPeople in Tradfi can also do this, it\u2019s comparable to taking a loan out against your house or company or stock portfolio. The difference is that you need a broker for it, where as with defi it\u2019s all automated.\n\nI\u2019ve taken out some loans via Aave (slightly different from MakerDao) in bull markets just to have some money to play around with all the apps in Defi and hunt airdrops. \n\nBtw this is a great question to ask top level in this daily.
