I bet this ends up looking silly.\n\nNo one likes Ethereum right now.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio\u2014a comparison of the price of Ethereum versus the price of Bitcoin\u2014recently hit its lowest level in three years. On a year-to-date basis Ethereum is flat while Bitcoin is up 38%, and Ethereum\u2019s top competitor, Solana, is up 31%.\n\nThe vibes in the community are tough.\n\nThere are many reasons for Ethereum\u2019s doldrums:\n\nElection Risk: Ethereum faces material risk in the November election. While Bitcoin has largely passed regulatory scrutiny\u2014even SEC Chair Gary Gensler admits it's not a security\u2014Ethereum has not. The SEC appears to think that staked ETH is a security, and the agency has significant worries about the broader DeFi ecosystem that drives much of Ethereum\u2019s value. If Harris wins and continues the Biden administration\u2019s skeptical posture towards crypto, Ethereum could face challenges.\n\nRising Competition from Solana and Others: Ethereum faces rising challenges from newer blockchains that offer higher throughput and lower costs. Solana is the leading example of this, but others\u2014both existing and soon-to-launch\u2014are starting to crowd the space. It\u2019s somewhat cool in crypto circles to be bullish on Solana and other new chains and bearish on Ethereum because of its older, costlier tech.\n\nChallenged Tokenomics: Over the past few years, the Ethereum community has made the decision to focus on growing transaction volume on \u201cLayer 2\u201d networks that surround Ethereum rather than on the core (or \u201cLayer 1\u201d) Ethereum blockchain itself. This has been wildly successful\u2014transaction activity on Layer 2s like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism is soaring. But the rise of Layer 2s has shifted so much volume away from Ethereum that its revenues are down to a four-year low. Many wonder if Ethereum has shot itself in the foot by scaling away from the foundational Layer 1 blockchain.\n\nMixed ETF Results: Ethereum ETFs have not had the same overwhelming success as Bitcoin ETFs. While newly launched ETFs have gathered billions, they\u2019ve been more than offset by $2.7 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).\n\nThese are good reasons to be concerned. But I think they miss the broader point.\n\nFrom 30,000 feet, it's true that blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are both trying to create a \u201cpublic computer\u201d\u2014global databases that other people can use for building applications. But when you look at which applications are seeing breakthrough success, they\u2019re almost all dominated by Ethereum:\n\nStablecoins: More than half of all stablecoins are issued on Ethereum.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): Over 60% of all DeFi assets are locked on Ethereum.\n\nPolymarket: The breakthrough prediction market ultimately settles on Ethereum.\n\nThere are many more examples.\n\nWhen BlackRock wanted to build a tokenized money market fund this year, it built on Ethereum; that fund now has more than $500 million in assets under management. When Nike launched a Web 3 gear platform called .Swoosh, it launched on Ethereum. When the next large traditional company wants to do a blockchain product, I bet they\u2019ll choose Ethereum too.\n\nEthereum has the most active developers, the most active users, and a market cap that is 5x bigger than its closest competitor. It\u2019s the only programmable blockchain that has a modicum of regulatory support in the U.S., with a booming regulated futures market and a multi-billion-dollar ETF market.\n\nIt\u2019s like the Microsoft of blockchains. Everyone wants to talk about Google and Slack and Zoom, and with good reason: Each of them has brought game-changing technology to the market. But Microsoft is still larger than all of them put together. \n\nNone of this means I\u2019m bearish on Solana or other chains. They are having significant impact, and there is a lot to be excited about. But I think people are too quick to look past Ethereum and the real-world success we\u2019re already seeing in its ecosystem.\n\nFrom my seat, none of Ethereum\u2019s challenges seem existential, and its opportunities are brimming. I suspect the market may reevaluate Ethereum as we get closer to the November elections and any regulatory clarity that emerges. For now, it looks like a potential contrarian bet through the end of the year.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><em>Decent <a href=\"https://experts.bitwiseinvestments.com/cio-memos/a-contrarian-bet-on-ethereum?_hsmi=325026337\">writeup</a> from Matt Hougan, the CIO at Bitwise, one of the spot ETF issuers:</em></p>\n\n<p>A Contrarian Bet on Ethereum\nMatt Hougan\nChief Investment Officer\nIt\u2019s cool to hate Ethereum right now.
