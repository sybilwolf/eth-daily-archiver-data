You can probably do anything from 10 minutes to read the proposal and vote to a full time job where you are coordinating with the community and actively creating proposals, attending calls and meetings. Some people travel to events, some don\u2019t. Ect.\n\n>Personally I spend maybe on average 30 minutes on 9/10 votes that come up. Read the proposal, read some feedback, make a post or two in the forums, vote. I do try to attend calls as they come up, basically just to listen or chat box comments. Sometimes votes are a little more complicated or controversial. Sometimes I\u2019ll take on expanded roles on stuff (temporary oversight committees, councils, ect)\u2026 It really varies how much you want to be involved - it\u2019s very flexible that way.\n\n>2) Nope, and honestly this is probably one of the easiest and approachable ways to get involved if you aren\u2019t a strong technical user. There will be technical votes that go over your head, but IMO part of the governance process isn\u2019t to be a know it all but to have oversight on those who are doing the work. And you can always phone a friend. Like, if your gonna vote on some technical upgrade your not expected to like review code or whatever\u2026. Often it\u2019s explained in laymen\u2019s terms. And truthfully 80% + of the votes are non-technical anyway.\n\n>I\u2019d probably caveat that you\u2019ll want to have some understanding of broad technical concepts. Or atleast the ability to read and digest information. I\u2019m talking like you wouldn\u2019t try to be a mechanic if you didn\u2019t even know what a tire was. But if your reading this post your probably already there by the fact your an active member in the community.\n\n>3) I\u2019ve found some personal fulfillment out of it. Whether I\u2019m making a true impact idk, but it\u2019s been cool to have the opportunity to make a tangible impact on the space considering my limited technical skill set.\n\n>You get to make connections with other users, and the opportunities that rise from that. I\u2019m not super into like getting to know every person on the planet here so it\u2019s not like I have 100 new friends, but I\u2019ve had some interesting convos with some cool people that I otherwise would not have. The networking aspect has lead to being able to join other mini-projects as well, if your into being involved in other ways.\n\n>There is also potential for payment. Whether that is directly incentivizing active delegates thru the DAO or just ancillary roles that pop up.

You can probably do anything from 10 minutes to read the proposal and vote to a full time job where you are coordinating with the community and actively creating proposals, attending calls and meetings. Some people travel to events, some don\u2019t. Ect.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I spend maybe on average 30 minutes on 9/10 votes that come up. Read the proposal, read some feedback, make a post or two in the forums, vote. I do try to attend calls as they come up, basically just to listen or chat box comments. Sometimes votes are a little more complicated or controversial. Sometimes I\u2019ll take on expanded roles on stuff (temporary oversight committees, councils, ect)\u2026 It really varies how much you want to be involved - it\u2019s very flexible that way.</p>\n\n<p>2) Nope, and honestly this is probably one of the easiest and approachable ways to get involved if you aren\u2019t a strong technical user. There will be technical votes that go over your head, but IMO part of the governance process isn\u2019t to be a know it all but to have oversight on those who are doing the work. And you can always phone a friend. Like, if your gonna vote on some technical upgrade your not expected to like review code or whatever\u2026. Often it\u2019s explained in laymen\u2019s terms. And truthfully 80% + of the votes are non-technical anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d probably caveat that you\u2019ll want to have some understanding of broad technical concepts. Or atleast the ability to read and digest information. I\u2019m talking like you wouldn\u2019t try to be a mechanic if you didn\u2019t even know what a tire was. But if your reading this post your probably already there by the fact your an active member in the community.</p>\n\n<p>3) I\u2019ve found some personal fulfillment out of it. Whether I\u2019m making a true impact idk, but it\u2019s been cool to have the opportunity to make a tangible impact on the space considering my limited technical skill set.</p>\n\n<p>You get to make connections with other users, and the opportunities that rise from that. I\u2019m not super into like getting to know every person on the planet here so it\u2019s not like I have 100 new friends, but I\u2019ve had some interesting convos with some cool people that I otherwise would not have. The networking aspect has lead to being able to join other mini-projects as well, if your into being involved in other ways.</p>\n\n<p>There is also potential for payment.

The priority is harming china, not benefiting america. </p>\n\n<p>On the rest I&#39;m not certain enough about the US budget process to comment. </p>\n\n<p>I believe they have particular mechanics to force through budgets but I dunno if that would appl to tarifs. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, I&#39;d like to say I really appreciate your replies to my comments, they&#39;re really well explained and they&#39;re exactly why I want to engage in these kinds of conversations.
