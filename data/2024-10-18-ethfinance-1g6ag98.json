Being a mod is truly a thankless job, I'm not here to criticize any of the mods individually.

Hard moderation, as enforced by mods, which can remove posts, comments, and ban users. Soft moderation, as enforced by users, which upvote/downvote posts, report violations of etiquette, and engage with discordant voices to either set the facts straight, call them out on blatant manipulation/lies or, (more rarely) find a common agreement/understanding.\n\nOf the two, the second one is the most important and effective day to day. Is what keeps the subreddit pleasant to come back and discuss, and a source of high signal/noise information. But the first one sets the right conditions for the second one to organically appear and do its job. Poor enforcement or excessively lax rules can cause the second form of moderation to disappear.\n\n/r/ethereum has lost to a large degree the second one. And it has lost it because the first one was often times too lax with abusers and slow to react to spam, scams and trolls. This has made /r/ethereum an adversarial place to discuss all things Ethereum, my experience (and seemingly that of others in /r/ethfinance ) is that you go there and try to explain things in a matter of fact manner, leaving aside opinions, just stating facts of the protocol behavior and you get downvoted or brigaded by trolls. If you leave that unchecked for a sufficient amount of time good-faith contributors simply leave. This is what has happened with /r/ethereum, the knowledgeable people that can contribute do not visit it often anymore because they have been pushed away by trolls in what should be the common plaza to speak all things Ethereum. This is a failure of past moderation practices, rules and enforcement. This has been in the making for years. And is going to take years to recover.\n\nAmericanScream is a minor nuisance in all of this, I personally prefer to engage with him in good faith and try to set the facts from the lies/stupid takes apart. I think that's more effective. Here is a recent example: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1g1vi9a/can_layer_2_scalability_really_undermine/lrla6k5/ and many other times in the past. I know my answer is completely useless to convince him of anything. My answer is not for him, though, is for the new arrivals that are trying to wrap their mind around Ethereum, see a critical voice and need different viewpoints to try to grasp what makes sense and what doesn't.\n\nWith that said, /r/ethereum takes a very very lax approach with FUDers. Probably an overreaction in the opposite direction to the /r/bitcoin debacle. It takes far less effort to produce FUD than to dispel it, and this asymmetry can only be dealt via harsh enforcement of systematic abusers or through shear numbers of posters that outnumber FUDders to the point of making their efforts go to waste. /r/ethereum has lost the second one as I tried to explain above, so it might have to enforce harsher rules to systematic abusers until it gets the social layer back.\n\nReaction time to clean up matters a lot too. It's not sufficient that a scam post gets eventually removed, I have reported many posts through the years and it's not uncommon to see no action is taken for hours. This is not to blame you or any other mods, I think the problem here is number of active mods vs size of the attack. /r/ethereum is a very juicy target, it likely attracts way more attention than other communities of equal size. /r/ethereum has a lot of mods that are close to the protocol, researchers, devs, etc... but that almost never participate on Reddit!

There are no mod settings or anti-brigade automod commands for karma manipulation. I looked into more yesterday based on your post to see IF there was a solution. It's not something automod deals with right now. I'm looking into another solution called ContextMod which sort of helps with this based on a user's post history, but again, karma manipulation is something we can't deal with and it's really frustrating as a mod because all I want is to flag posts with \"x upvotes in y minutes.\"\n\nAs for the trolls; I think this problem extends to before my tenure. I joined as a mod about 1.5 years ago. You may have noticed in this time that scam posts are taken down much faster than before. I have a setting on my phone where I get a push notification any time 2+ reports come in on any post or submission. And I act as quickly as possible (unless I am sleeping). I am not omnipotent. And so if there are trolls or scammers, I am only alerted IF the community alerts me (this type of soft moderation as you mentioned). I also have to toe the line of free speech. Certain things are spam and unacceptable, and we delete them. Other things don't break the rules and should simply be community moderated through downvotes (which will collapse the comment for other users).\n\nI haven't seen as many trolls recently, but again, I can't see everything. If you see something, report it, and I'll make a judgement. To be clear, we promote free speech and don't simply remove anti-ETH rhetoric or bears. As you mentioned with AmericanScream, the best way to deal with it is to respond in good faith. I generally agree with you that this is how these type of people should be dealt with.\n\n  \nRegarding FUD, maybe we do need to be more active on banning that type of behavior. If it's reported more, I'll check the person's account and see if they have a history of it. The problem is that many people just create new accounts and spam. I'll look into some mechanics for minimum karma and time in the sub to see what I can implement. I'm planning on doing an overhaul of our automod actually to help this.\n\nRegarding reaction time; as I've mentioned, the reaction time this last year to clean up scams has gone down vastly. I clean them up as they come into my notifications, which is generally between 15m-1h after they are posted. The faster the community reports them (2+ reports), the faster I can take them down. I actually don't think we need more mods here. We have added mods in the past, and most do something for a week and then stop forever. We could probably use ONE more mod to help me and cover the hours when I am asleep. Honestly, that would be enough. Or we just have another one of the current mods enable the same notifications that I have on.\n\nI agree with you that the sub isn't in a great place. I am actively working on bettering it. I sparked a conversation last night in our telegram that got good discussion as well to how we can improve things. I appreciate your sentiments and if you have feedback you can reach me at any time via DM. I'm even willing to privately give you my telegram if you think it would help.\n\nAgain, here to serve.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I would like to start off by saying thank you for this detailed post.

And so if there are trolls or scammers, I am only alerted IF the community alerts me (this type of soft moderation as you mentioned). I also have to toe the line of free speech. Certain things are spam and unacceptable, and we delete them. Other things don&#39;t break the rules and should simply be community moderated through downvotes (which will collapse the comment for other users).</p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t seen as many trolls recently, but again, I can&#39;t see everything. If you see something, report it, and I&#39;ll make a judgement. To be clear, we promote free speech and don&#39;t simply remove anti-ETH rhetoric or bears. As you mentioned with AmericanScream, the best way to deal with it is to respond in good faith. I generally agree with you that this is how these type of people should be dealt with.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding FUD, maybe we do need to be more active on banning that type of behavior. If it&#39;s reported more, I&#39;ll check the person&#39;s account and see if they have a history of it. The problem is that many people just create new accounts and spam. I&#39;ll look into some mechanics for minimum karma and time in the sub to see what I can implement. I&#39;m planning on doing an overhaul of our automod actually to help this.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding reaction time; as I&#39;ve mentioned, the reaction time this last year to clean up scams has gone down vastly. I clean them up as they come into my notifications, which is generally between 15m-1h after they are posted. The faster the community reports them (2+ reports), the faster I can take them down. I actually don&#39;t think we need more mods here. We have added mods in the past, and most do something for a week and then stop forever. We could probably use ONE more mod to help me and cover the hours when I am asleep. Honestly, that would be enough. Or we just have another one of the current mods enable the same notifications that I have on.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with you that the sub isn&#39;t in a great place. I am actively working on bettering it. I sparked a conversation last night in our telegram that got good discussion as well to how we can improve things. I appreciate your sentiments and if you have feedback you can reach me at any time via DM. I&#39;m even willing to privately give you my telegram if you think it would help.</p>\n\n<p>Again, here to serve.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-10-21 12:37:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lt2169h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1g6ag98","parent_id":"t1_lt0t5pn","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pa7x1","body":"Thanks a lot for your work.
