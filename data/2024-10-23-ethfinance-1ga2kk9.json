It is clear to me that we either a) need to close the sub if no active moderations returns, b) get a new bunch of moderators over there and purge old ones and c) find a way to get moderation over there to be more sustainable.\n\nI hate to break it to you guys but there's a very real possibility that r/ethfinance is not long-term sustainable. We don't see enough new users coming in at a fast enough rate to replace old ones, but while we have users, we have a powerful community. So I think it's time we used it. So I have a proposal.\n\nI'd like to propose that we get a team together to fight the FUD. Much like what Anthony Sassano has been doing in his Discord and X, and we can likely collaborate with the Daily Gwei discord members and the info there to start a resettling campaign in r/Ethereum.\n\nI know, it's a big and daunting task, but I see it as a critical place where we are losing would be new community members due to misinformation.\n\nSo what does this look like? I think we need a team of new mods, one which I would happily step up and be a part of and help to organise things similar to how I have seen u/jtnichol, u/the-a-word and u/hanniabu step up and get behind the daily doots podcast. Much like them, I think a core team of a handful of mods, ideally with some experience but more importantly with motivation as well as a wider coordinated effort of contributors to provide educational content similar to dooters could be built around the sub. I also think to sustainably encourage successful moderation we need incentives and it doesn't have to be much. But if we can get an organisation going and be transparent we can apply for public goods funding to compensate the most active moderators. This can be done by collecting data on moderated actions and community input to distribute any funds received. In my opinion, this will help to solve the sustainability problem we have had caused by burnout and a lack of a collective effort with previous r/ethereum moderation revival efforts.\n\nMaybe I'm just naive to the real scope of this goal, but I think it's very important. Thousands of people head into r/Ethereum by association and they see a cesspit devoid of information which is not even remotely representative of Ethereum, but regardless, as the first stopping point for many, it gives them a first impression and pushes people away before they can even join.\n\nDefinitely looking for feedback and input on this. I'm not an r/Ethereum mod either so this is more a pitch to them than anything. But I'd love to see a project spin out of this and I'm excited to see what we can achieve with a bit more coordination and community behind it this time around.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think a lot of people don&#39;t realise just how much damage is done by the sheer amount of misinformation in <a href=\"/r/ethereum\">r/ethereum</a>.

One of the things that stuck the most with me was that his thesis is that \"not all blockspace is created equally\". \n\nRight now there are a lot of people that say that blockspace is commoditised or will be in the future. There are several arguments for that (design of blockchains converging long term, chains abstracted away etc.) but obviously it's not a given we are headed down that path. Some chains just are more secure, neutral, etc. \n\nWhat's even more interesting is that these people often say that because blockspace is fungible, tokens will go to zero / sideways. \n\nI believe that is not the case. Crypto is a special industry because you are designing/ selling at least two, potentially even more \"products\". In the case of L1s this is blockspace and the token. (In the case of apps it could also include equity, see Uniswap) Even if blockspace is a commodity (which I doubt), you have some additional influence over your token design that can lead to a success story because it's unique. \n\nBitcoin is the perfect example. Bitcoin the asset will survive Bitcoin the network/ chain. And the same might be true for ETH. Why?

One of the things that stuck the most with me was that his thesis is that &quot;not all blockspace is created equally&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Right now there are a lot of people that say that blockspace is commoditised or will be in the future. There are several arguments for that (design of blockchains converging long term, chains abstracted away etc.) but obviously it&#39;s not a given we are headed down that path. Some chains just are more secure, neutral, etc. </p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s even more interesting is that these people often say that because blockspace is fungible, tokens will go to zero / sideways. </p>\n\n<p>I believe that is not the case.
