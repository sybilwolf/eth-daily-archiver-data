No, it's fantastic, it is just a consequence of the upgrade and activity not exploding _just yet_, but this is an illusion. If you take a look at L2Beat in mid 2023 and today, the amount of new L2s is absolutely ridiculous. It seems like there's more new L2s than new apps and it is insanely easy to underestimate the potential effects of this.\n\nWhile everyone is looking at useless ratios like ETH/BTC or ETH/SOL, plenty of new projects are appearing to develop their own L2s. Ethereum is no longer just an 'app chain' it is a chain of chains. Pretty much what Polkadot or Cosmos set out to be, but in a more 'open' way so to speak. I don't understand in full depth the implementation of app chains in these two other projects, but in Ethereum I know projects can have plenty of different configurations regarding where data is stored, where execution happens, etc etc. The appearance of macro-protocols like Eigenlayer is a clear telling that there's money to be made in scaling Ethereum, and this is where I presume most of the investor liquidity coming to fund projects on Ethereum is going. I'd be worried when this stops, but not right now.\n\nIn some way, what has been built on Ethereum is the ability to have external anchored applications, chains or other products of this kind which benefit from inheriting some level of security from the base layer blockchain.\n\nSo who's using this? Users I guess? Right now there may not be enough activity to justify the price increasing, as Ethereum being saturated in some way equates to 'cash flows'. Right now, given that the future of Ethereum's L2 and base layer explosive activity is 'on pause' as the upgrade _just kicked in earlier this year_, it is hard for investors estimate the value of those cash flows.\n\nFor BTC, the expectation that Bitcoin (the blockchain) will make any changes to itself in order to accomodate new featuresets is pretty much non-existent. On Ethereum, the fact that the base layer can be upgraded and changed allows for new concepts to emerge, for current concepts to be improved, etc. So Ethereum is inherently dependent on the combination of upgrades and activity improving its future cash flows (fees from on-chain activity). Right now, this is lackluster or inconsistent, so once this activity starts kicking in, which might depend or not on price, the consistency of those cash flows will be more visible. \n\nBasically, It's hard to justify investing large amounts of capital in a peer-to-peer network native currency when there's not enough certainty about its future cash flows. Before the upgrade such a comparatively meaningless amount of activity would saturate the chain that future cash flows were 'easier to expect'.\n\nI think there's several reasons why BTC is outperforming ETH this year:\n\n1. Historically this is the pattern in bullish periods (BTC outperforms, then it doesn't)\n2. The BTC ETFs started trading earlier in the year, when the war in the middle east wasn't at its absolute height of explosiveness, when the economy had a better outlook because the high interest rates hadn't affected the US job market, the profitability of the carry trade etc, etc. There's many macroeconomic reasons we can point out, but back in early 2024, things looked WAY better than now even when plenty of banks had collapsed the year prior due to high interest rates. They don't look _that_ bad now, but the outlook was very bleak during the summer.\n3. The ETH ETFs were a complete uncertainty, now they're a reality, but they started trading in quite literally the _weakest_ moment in the market of this year.\n4. Network activity on Ethereum has apparently subsided significantly (not really, but this is what it would seem like to the untrained eye, this is related to what I explained in the post)\n5. BTC is simply more popular not only due to its brand name, that too, but very importantly because it is a very static, unchanging asset with very little medium-term uncertainty, akin to gold. Which is something investors like. ETH is more uncertain.\n6. BTC seems to have no competition, ETH seems to have competition, even if it really doesn't.\n\nYou'd really have to be really deep into the rabbit hole to understand the value of ETH and the Ethereum blockchain beyond the surface-level perspective an investor trading many many assets in a traditional sense would have. Many traders trade based on cash flows and certainty of cash flows, and Ethereum carries some uncertainty with it and is having a 'weak' year in terms of cash flows.\n\nI won't get into why SOL is outperforming ETH in any meaningful level of detail, but in short, from my perspective:\n\n- the hype around memecoins (expectation of cash flows drives liquidity seeking returns in large numbers)\n- the fact that it's a smaller marketcap asset\n- the price is lower and you can buy 'a whole unit of it'\n- there's apparent activity on it\n- it's boosted by entities that want to pump the shit out of it to seek exit liquidity\n- it has a lot of marketing due to the previous point\n- it has provided extraordinary returns this year, so there's expectation that this will keep on happening\n- most of the supply is held by entities that don't sell it (large stakers and node operators which additionally receive most of the inflation)\n- etc etc\n\nIf anyone reads this wall of text pls correct me if you find any flaws in my reasoning. I hope it helps some have some perspective as to why I believe ETH's performance this year has been lackluster comparatively to other assets.\n\nEdit: small tweaks, typo fixes and corrected some term precision (I try not to use ETH and Ethereum interchangeably, as ETH is the asset and Ethereum is the network)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Believe it or not, the blobs upgrade might be one of the bigger reasons why ETH isn&#39;t doing much better price wise.

They are a very good engineering team. Their ability to iterate quickly and deliver cool features is good.

All of this of course is because they are not committed to stability nearly on the same level as Ethereum and have little historical baggage. And their scaling philosophy is, as we all know, very very different from Ethereum.\n\nTo me the most telling thing about any ecosystem is not any technological feature but whether developers go there. Developers do not pick their career or what they work on lightly and a lot of ideological, technical and historical factors go into that decision. A lot of companies go to Ethereum (I work for a company that's building on Ethereum, for one), but recently I was reading a Farcaster cast from a developer that their product feels unwelcome in Ethereum circles (forgot the reason, I think it was not public-goods enough or something?) and they decided to move on to Solana.
