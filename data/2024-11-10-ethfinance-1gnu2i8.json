I think it works because they are older and furthest removed from crypto.\n\nThe purpose of the above top indicators is not to create my DCA plan but to either confirm my DCA plan or more importantly warn me that the cycle is different and I need to trash my DCA plan and exit the market immediately. \n\nI believe /u/Tricky_Troll also had a similar strategy that he once shared.\n\nI'm also considering exiting the market completely if my top targets are not hit by end of 2025 (4 year cycle). Something of a time based sell warning sign. \n\n**DCA out plan** is made ideally in the bear (i am more rational than in the bull fomo) and based on my expectations of where the next top will be and my financial targets (buying toys / a house / FIRE):\n\n- DCA out starts just above previous ATH ($4800)\n- Final sell (90% out by that time) by the fib level I expect to be the top which is 2.618 = $11.2k, the rest 10% is for if I'm wrong and we keep going\n- The range between 4800 and 11200 is divided into equal intervals say 2%\n- Sell quantity is the same for each interval except at the major fib levels where I sell a bit more\n- I aim for a decent average DCA out price that is both reasonable and enough to meet my goals, but this DCA approach is much safer in case I'm wrong and the top is like $8k.\n- make the plan before we break 4800, and don't change it as FOMO grips you\n- Don't base sell targets solely on what you would like the price to be to achieve your goals but more on what the indicators say. \n\nNote: my trading stack is separate and I use a very different strategy there, including using memecoins & VC coins.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I appreciate it!

Back testing shows how good this works for both BTC cycles and the last 3 ETH cycles.</p>\n\n<p>I like to stop my DCA buys at under half of the previous ATH. It&#39;s what I did last cycle and I did it this time too. So I stopped around $2k on the way up. I like symmetry lol, started buying at 2k on the way down, stopped buying at 2k on the way up. </p>\n\n<p>I also keep an eye on BTC simply because there are more indicators for it than for ETH (such as lookintobitcoin.com):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BTC touching the 200 week MA, and going below it is BUY time for both BTC and ETH </li>\n<li>Puell multiple green zone is BUY time for both BTC and ETH</li>\n<li>2 year MA multiplier price below the green line is BUY time for both BTC and ETH</li>\n<li>Price before Realized Price indicator line</li>\n<li>MVRV Zscore in the green zone</li>\n<li>Price below the &#39;Longterm Holder Realized Price&#39;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>IMO its easier to identify bottom buy zones than the tops.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In real-time once the bull is underway</strong>: Tops can be identified by some of the above indicators plus a few more subjective things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Puell multiple red zone</li>\n<li>Pi cycle top indicator, when the orange line touches the green line</li>\n<li>2 year MA multiplier, price touches the red line</li>\n<li>Net unrealized profit/loss, line touching euphoria zone</li>\n<li><p>MVRV Zscore in the red zone</p></li>\n<li><p>Signs of retail piling in (ETF is a new thing to watch)</p></li>\n<li><p>When relatives suddenly remember the crypto they bought 3-4 years ago and ask me about it</p></li>\n<li><p>When my pastors mention bitcoin to me (100% hit rate for the top to the very month in the last 2 cycles!). I think it works because they are older and furthest removed from crypto.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The purpose of the above top indicators is not to create my DCA plan but to either confirm my DCA plan or more importantly warn me that the cycle is different and I need to trash my DCA plan and exit the market immediately. </p>\n\n<p>I believe <a href=\"/u/Tricky_Troll\">/u/Tricky_Troll</a> also had a similar strategy that he once shared.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also considering exiting the market completely if my top targets are not hit by end of 2025 (4 year cycle). Something of a time based sell warning sign. </p>\n\n<p><strong>DCA out plan</strong> is made ideally in the bear (i am more rational than in the bull fomo) and based on my expectations of where the next top will be and my financial targets (buying toys / a house / FIRE):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DCA out starts just above previous ATH ($4800)</li>\n<li>Final sell (90% out by that time) by the fib level I expect to be the top which is 2.618 = $11.2k, the rest 10% is for if I&#39;m wrong and we keep going</li>\n<li>The range between 4800 and 11200 is divided into equal intervals say 2%</li>\n<li>Sell quantity is the same for each interval except at the major fib levels where I sell a bit more</li>\n<li>I aim for a decent average DCA out price that is both reasonable and enough to meet my goals, but this DCA approach is much safer in case I&#39;m wrong and the top is like $8k.</li>\n<li>make the plan before we break 4800, and don&#39;t change it as FOMO grips you</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t base sell targets solely on what you would like the price to be to achieve your goals but more on what the indicators say. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note: my trading stack is separate and I use a very different strategy there, including using memecoins &amp; VC coins.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-10 03:45:36","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-11-10 08:17:58","id":"lwechpd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1gnu2i8","parent_id":"t1_lwe2m8r","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"> /u/TrickyTroll\n\nCongratulations on tagging a stranger.\n\n>I believe /u/TrickyTroll also had a similar strategy that he once shared.\n\n[Correctamundo](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/hiksh6/how_i_plan_to_identify_and_sell_the_top_of_the/)\n\nI was using:\n\n- MVRV Z-Score\n\n- Puell Multiple\n\n- Pi Cycle Top Indicator\n\n- Reserve Risk\n\n- Golden Ratio Multiplier\n\nNeedless to say I did not actially manage to sell the top.
