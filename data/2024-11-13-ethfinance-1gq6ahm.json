Cheers to Lamboshi for joining me as an EthFinance rep, I am glad I was not alone. So basically, the friction is because some OG mods have core alignment differences. However I believe we were willing to agree upon a compromise. We are happy to concede that price discussion is strictly limited to the daily threads. They are ok with price discussion featuring on the sub in this limited form. Generally at the table we had 3 groups; obviously us EthFinanciers who want to effectively move in and takeover if it were strictly up to us; there was the OG Ethereum mods who are rather cypherpunk and are all for avoiding price talk as they are strictly there for the tech and no \"censorship\" beyond removing scams; and finally there were the mostly active newer mods who are pragmatic and recognise that a) r/Ethereum is a bit of a dumpster-fire due to trolls being left to run rampant and b) there is a lack of community and little signal to noise, therefore, they are open to us coming in if not keen to have us.\n\nAfter about 2 hours of discussions, we seemed to be in agreement of general acceptable terms. As I understood it (and I hope everyone else remembers it this way), they were:\n\n- Price discussion is allowed but strictly in the daily discussion. Not in standalone posts. This likely applies to issuance discussions outside of maybe in the relevance of EIPs but that's a specific we can figure out later.\n\n- A more EthFinance style approach to banning and removing posts where we will ban low effort trolls rather than sticking with r/Ethereum's long-term policy of free-speech (aside from scams which have unsurprisingly always been ban worthy over there).\n\n- If we merge, our mod team can move over along with the community, but the OG mods wanted the mods who they considered \"trustworthy people\" in the top spots (top of the list mods can kick off lower hierarchy mods at any time). They indicated that they didn't consider us trustworthy because they didn't really know us (fair enough I guess). However, us EthFinance mods also said that we didn't trust the Ethereum OGs because of their disagreement with us over price discussion. Therefore, we said that the acceptable hierarchy would see the \"neutral\" mods at the top, people like abcoathup and DarkestTimelineJeff to ensure that us EthFinance mods can feel safe in that we won't get removed and that any disagreements in modding style/governance of the sub can be discussed rather than us getting rage ejected. After allocating the top 2-3 spots, I said it was fine for the OGs to be above us in the hierarchy as they wished to be in the top 5 for \"security reasons\" (basically this is to prevent us from ejecting them which is fair enough and also to prevent getting taken over after an account hack, Ligi is a pretty hardcore cypherpunk after all so I imagine he has good OpSec.).\n\n- Our community building stuff like the podcast, doots etc would be greatly welcomed as it helps build community and this increases user retention.\n\n- We will purge all non-active mods after giving them a warning that we will do so unless they wish to become active again (aside from Vitalik I believe).\n\nThe plan from here is to agree upon a framework of rules to guide when we approve, remove, ban and temp-ban users in an effort to prevent rogue mods on either side of the OG vs EthFinance split. This should help for any future disagreements too as we have a bit of a constitution type thing to refer back to to settle things. After that we can consider how we do the actual merge. \ud83d\udc3c\n\nI also would like to hear what the community here has to say. At the end of the day, if most people here are against a merge, then we probably won't do it. But the current reality is that this subreddit is slowly dying due to a lack of new users and r/Ethereum lacks community and consequently cannot retain the new users it does get. By merging the subs, we believe we can fix these issues and create a more impactful community to promote Ethereum and its core values.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Checking back in after the meeting.

And yes, Anatoly is wrong about this and Jon Charbonneau is wrong about this. When you have 99.9999% staked (picking an extreme value to make the case explicit), everyone staking is doing it at a loss. Because whatever minimal costs you may have (CapEx, Opex, taxes...) is subtracted from your earnings. But at 100% stake rates, the token issuance is just a token re-denomination. It behaves like a stock split, you are not earning any new value because you are diluting from yourself! And yet you have to pay from your own self-dilution the OpEx, CapEx and taxes... End result, everyone is under water. Staking becomes a cost for everyone.\n\n- They lead towards centralization of the validator set due to economies of scale. Pushing out solo stakers in favor of LSTs and institutional products like the ETFs.\n\n- They pose a risk to the protocol. As very high stake rates create an incentive to break consensus rules in case of a bug.

In fact, the point of addressing this issue now is that we can set up the issuance curve so that solo stakers are incentivized and protected from being pushed out economically.\n\nWhile the longer we wait it will become very hard to undo.

Then, we use cost structures that are reasonably realistic for different types of validators.

Large stakers can also put the effort to uncorrelate better their validators, in that case they will also benefit.

Lots of talks, lots of food, and lots of frogs. I did have some other commitments to juggle as usual, but for the most part it was a chill day.\n\nTrying to keep it a little short today so I can get some sleep, but here's an overview of the talks I attended:\n\n* Will Villanueva, author of EIP 2938 on account abstraction and current contributor to Bonkbot, gave a lightning talk on how to rethink Ethereum's account model. The main vision is use of state access lists, specified by each transaction and enforced by the runtime. Biggest benefit is that it would allow for parallel block execution, but it would also provide better security as compared to the approve flows we're used to.\n* Marc Harvey-Hill, core dev at Nethermind followed up with another lightning talk, this one on encrypted mempools. The proposal suggested that all transactions from an encrypted mempool would be included in priority order at the top of the block, which sounds like it's overly constraining MEV but okay. You need a key keeper of some sort, could be a TEE, threshold encryption, or a VDF. There was a quick mention of homomorphic encryption to allow for adjusting the ordering of transactions without visibility into what they are. For now there's EIP-7793 which would provide an opcode to enable out-of-protocol encrypted mempools, but ultimately he's eyeing an enshrined solution.\n* Luca Donno, researcher at L2BEAT, compared systems for fraud proofs on optimistic rollups. The ideal of having any single honest challenger able to defend a rollup from attacks is threatened due to the effectiveness of Sybil attacks. In a *full concurrency* system, an attacker could send millions of invalid state roots faster than they can be proved wrong. The challenger needs to lock up an ETH bond for each challenge, so if the attacker has deeper pockets they can exhaust the challenger's capital and eventually get an invalid root through. Solution: make the bond requirements asymmetrical to bias it in the challenger's favor. In a *partial concurrency* system, challenges are resolved individually and sequentially, so a Sybil attack doesn't exhaust capital but instead locks up the system for potentially many years. Solution: create a binary tree of roots and make that like a competition bracket, so Sybils eliminate each other over the course of `log(n)` rounds. There's a trilemma of sorts between promptness vs safety vs decentralization.\n* Gabriel Coutinho de Paula, researcher and contributor to the Cartesi ecosystem, gave a great followup by presenting the Dave fraud proof algorithm. This strikes a balance on the trilemma by offering a fairly low bond requirement, low expenses, and ~4 week total time. It's structured as a pairwise refutation game: in each round state roots are grouped in pairs, and the goal is to prove to the L1 base layer that their opponent's result of computation is incorrect. Players act in turns in a binary search, with a timer like a chess clock's (I didn't quite get it all so I can't present it too coherently). Losing a single match isn't immediately eliminatory, because that would mean a little censorship at the right time could block the challenger; instead you get eliminated after some `n` losses. In the end, hopefully, a single honest challenger with a simple laptop would be able to defeat a well-resourced attacker, without it taking years.\n* Dennis Trautwein and Yiannis Psaras of ProbeLab gave an overview of their suite of tools for monitoring the health of the Ethereum network. Nebula is a p2p network crawler that can monitor liveness of peers. Hermes is a gossipsub listener and tracer, measuring latency, duplicate messages, and bandwidth consumption. They've found a high ratio of duplicates per message, and that IHAVE messages represent 33% of bandwidth usage. Ookla is a network bandwidth monitor, which downloads a specific volume of data from peers so as to not saturate their upload speed, while measuring the transfer speed to estimate bandwidth. Could be very useful for understanding home staker bandwidth requirements!\n* Nixorokish of EthStaker/EF and Pol Lanski of Dappnode hosted a fishbowl discussion at the Home Node Operator Hub discussing how solo stakers can advocate for themselves. I just learned about this \"fishbowl\" format, where they had 4 chairs and the goal is to always have one chair open. So if there are three people chatting and someone from the audience comes up to join in, one of the other three must volunteer to step out, opening up another seat. Anyway, discussion produced a few ideas. One was to work on a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for solo stakers--basically just guides but for after your node is running, like debugging maybe but also how to spread awareness of your pain points and get involved in the wider ecosystem. Nixo likes picking a specific topic of concern and making a big stink about it, which she admitted wasn't for everyone. The Aztec team encouraged solo stakers to get involved in running testnets and providing feedback from the solo staker perspective.\n* Michal Zajac, leader of the research team at Nethermind, explained some considerations for the security of the Fiat-Shamir transformation for zero-knowledge proofs. As background, many ZKPs can be structured *interactively*, where the prover has to respond to a series of challenges by revealing a tiny bit of information each time, and if they can do so repeatedly and correctly, you can feel confident they have a correct proof. Fiat-Shamir takes this process and makes it *non-interactive*, an important property on a blockchain so the proof can be generated once by the prover and verified asynchronously by anyone else any time. The security consideration is as follows. In an interactive proof, if a malicious prover encounters a challenge they can't fake, they're done and have to just stop responding. In a Fiat-Shamir non-interactive proof, the malicious prover can \"rewind\" if they run into a challenge they can't beat, change a few proof parameters, and try again until they find the perfect setup to beat the challenges. Assume probability of breaking a protocol of ~2^-100. The whole world might be able to put out ~2^85 attempts per day, so the *actual* probability of breaking a Fiat-Shamir system is ~2^-15 per day. Okay for now, but worrisome as compute power grows. Parallel repetition helps. Moral: it's hard to implement Fiat-Shamir properly and be careful tuning your parameters.\n* There was a cool-sounding talk on the calendar about why token voting sucks, but looks like it just didn't happen :(.\n\nETH price doesn't matter. The ratio doesn't matter. There's all sorts of cool stuff going on here, and a ton of presentations that demonstrate the sheer amount of buidling that's gone down this year. Disregard noise. Acquire signal.\n\nOkay, sleepy time. Lidoconnect tomorrow I guess. Maybe just for a little while then back to the main venue.

Like, how are we still telling people about bitcoin 4-year cycles, halving trends, and people still don\u2019t buy / call btc purchases right now dumb because btc is \u201cat the top\u201d ??</p>\n\n<p>Sorry to bring some pessimism back into the threads, but I think because I\u2019m now at a point where I have capital and see bitcoin performing, and I didn\u2019t follow the advice when I was younger to \u201chave a bit of both so you don\u2019t get fomo during these trade off periods\u201d I\u2019m really feeling it now for some reason.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>All this to say, I love this community and the mission of Ethereum, but I\u2019m starting to feel like the retail pitch of complexity is something I personally am convicted by, but is starting to feel like it\u2019s not the smartest investment thesis solely from a roi perspective.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>End of rant, but I think I\u2019m also hoping to ask for advice here because I trust this community so much more\u2014given I\u2019m looking into buying bitcoin for the first time, now is as good a time as any right? We\u2019re about 150 days past halving which historically has never dipped to a lower price point to buy, we\u2019re ramping up into the holidays when family members will be shilled, bull feels like it\u2019s loading up; if there\u2019s liquid capital to purchase, now is about as good a time as any despite it being ath for bitcoin\u2026 am I right in thinking that and seeing the trend lines from past post-halvings? Any pullbacks will be fairly negligible in overall gain a year from now if no black swan events carry out? Don\u2019t invest more than you\u2019re willing to lose and all that jazz assumed.
