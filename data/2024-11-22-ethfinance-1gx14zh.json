The sales, which concluded on Friday, May 24, were part of FTX\u2019s broader efforts to liquidate its assets following its high-profile bankruptcy.\n\n> Figure Markets secured a block of 800,000 SOL tokens for approximately $80 million, translating to about $102 per token. This price represents a significant discount, with Solana trading at $169 at the time. Pantera Capital also participated in the auction, although the exact details of their purchase remain undisclosed.\n\n> Just like with the previous SOL auctions, all tokens are subject to a four-year vesting period. This means that the tokens are locked and cannot be sold by buyers immediately. Instead, they will be gradually unlocked over the course of four years, starting with 20% in March 2025.
