That is why it was agreed that the rollup centric roadmap is the way to go forward. \n\nLet me go into more detail:\n\nDecentralization is difficult to quantitatively define, but I guess most of us have an intuitive understanding of what it means, so I leave it at that. Decentralization in itself is not why we want to decentralize the network. We want to have properties which come with decentralization. These properties are:\n\n- Permissionlessness: Anyone can participate.\n\n- Trustlessness: You do not have to trust a central authority to make sure your funds are safe.\n\n- Immutability: Once a transaction is on chain it is difficult to revert it or even pretty much impossible after the block has been finalized a few minutes later.\n\n- Censorship resistance: No single entity/state actor can apply pressure to prevent certain users to use the network or prevent interaction with certain contracts.\n\n- Resilience: Local outages cannot harm the Ethereum network at all.\n\n- Security: No one can move your funds without having access to your private key.\n\n- Transparency. Anyone can verify that the transactions have been applied correctly.\n\nRollups can achieve these properties without having to have tens of thousands of nodes running all around the world by the following methods:\n\n- Increase and distribute number of sequencers. This can be permissionless or even permissioned as long as multiple entities are allowed to sequence and they are in different jurisdictions they are not beholden to a single entity. This makes access to the network permissionless. There do not need to be thousands of sequencers to achieve that. A handful are enough. \n\n- Having more than 1 centralized sequencer massively increases the resilience. Again, a handful are enough. Some rollups also have the property that if no new state roots have been proposed for some time they become permissionless and anyone can the jump in to become a sequencer.\n\n- Fraud proofs or zk proofs directly give you trustlessness. A centralized sequencer cannot move your funds as as long as a fraud proof system is there. This gives you the same security as on L1 .\n\n- With posting state roots to the L1 the rollups cannot revert transactions anymore as they would have to attack the L1. This gives us immutability. The larger rollups (Base, Arbitrum and Optimism) post state roots every minute or 5 minutes. This means we get immutability on pretty much the same level as on L1.\n\n- Censorship resistance: If you have escape hatches and forced transaction inclusion in the smart contract on L1 we can have censorship resistance even with a single centralized sequencer. Sure it is not real-time censorship resistance, but for most practical purposes good enough to prevent censorship as any attempt to censor can be circumvented through the L1. A more decentralized sequencer set can help in real-time censorship resistance, but it is technically not necessary for general censorship resistance.\n\n- Publishing transaction data in blobs lets anyone follow the current state of the rollup. Similar transparency as Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAre rollups the infinitely scalable, resilient, permissionless and censorship-free utopia that we set out to build a few years ago? No, not by any means. There are so many ways that your money can be stolen, you can be censored or they just stop working without anyone being able to get their funds out. The most extreme example is if you use an optimistic rollup without fraud proofs a sequencer can essentially move your funds without you signing anything with your private keys and there is nothing you can do about it. Pretty similar to what your bank or credit card company can do, right? But we now also have some positive examples how a good rollup design helps user keeping access to their funds: The recent shutdown of dydx v3 does not mean that anyone lost any money, users can still exit their funds through the escape hatch. Kudos to StarkEX (starknet) for designing this rollup properly.\n\nThat is why the work of L2beat is so important. They defined all the different stages and look at various ways a rollup can steal your funds. The most advanced ones like Arbitrum and OP mainnet are now on a level were they are pretty close to the end stage and the only inherent danger for your funds are bridge upgrades on Ethereum L1. In my impression these are mostly an issue of how much rollups trust their overall design and not so much a technical issue. Meaning, rollups (or the DAOS behind them) 'just' have to decide to make the L1 bridge contracts immutable. They could do that today, but I guess they rather let it accumulate more lindyness before they do a next step. I generally feel pretty comfortable having a large portion of my wealth on selected optimistic rollups (Arbitrum, OP mainnet or Base) as well as some smaller portions on zk rollups.\n\nAnd if you think about it, it is pretty mind blowing being able to transact through centralized sequencers and still being able to have most of the advantages a fully decentralized L1 gives you but at an orders of magnitude higher scale.

It may just be getting started. Ether and the exchange-traded funds that track it are up about 49% since Nov. 5, compared to bitcoin at 38% in the same period. After the expectedly lethargic launch of the ETFs in July, they began registering big inflows after the election following a trend of mostly outflows. Investors had abandoned ether for much of 2024, questioning its investment opportunity. Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition became easier to grasp than ether\u2019s alongside the success of bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum competitor Solana surged in popularity and ether\u2019s supply rose despite a previous tech upgrade that should have had reduced supply. Plus, the absence of regulatory clarity has meant an inability for investors to \u201d stake \u201d their ether for yield. It\u2019s still up 59% for 2024, but it\u2019s trailing bitcoin at 126% and the rest of the crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 index, at 94%. Now there\u2019s room for ether to run higher. It simply stands to gain more than bitcoin from the regulatory shift to come in 2025. \u201cEthereum use cases are more extensive than Bitcoin\u2019s and do require clear rules of the road from regulators in order to fulfill its full vision, and that\u2019s why the election outcome is even more important for Ethereum than it is for Bitcoin,\u201d said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale Investments \u2014 which manages the GBTC and ETHE ETFs. Mark Connors, head of global macro strategy at Onramp, said ether suffered from \u201cmiddle child syndrome\u201d this year as the market overlooked it in favor of its older sibling bitcoin and younger digital currency Solana. He also agreed that a friendlier regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump should boost its price in the coming months. \u201d[The] Trump impact on bitcoin and crypto including ETH is not priced in yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing price discovery take place as we speak to determine the next price level.\u201d Bitcoin, which has become more widely accepted as a store of value, is the crypto asset with the clearest regulatory status in the United States. By contrast, Ethereum needs to interact with traditional financial services firms for things like payments, tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). The supportive regulatory environment Trump promised will lead to growth in financial applications that hasn\u2019t been possible in the U.S. under President Joe Biden, Pandl explained. \u201cThe fact that the election results went the way that they did means Ethereum has a strong chance of leading in tokenization, stablecoins and DeFi and really solidifying itself as the global settlement layer for finance,\u201d he added. The market cap for stablecoins spiked 9.5% after the election and now stands at more than $180 billion. The market cap of Tether ( USDT ), which makes up 72% of the stablecoin market, increased 10% and USD Coin ( USDC ) grew 6% since Nov. 5. Ethereum is the main blockchain for both stablecoins. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management \u2014 which also issues a bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) and an ether ETF ( ETHW ) \u2014 said he expects the new Congress to pass stablecoin legislation, which could take the market cap to more than $1 trillion in the next year or two. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a shotgun start of major Wall Street firms who want to make sure they have a foot in the door in crypto, and we\u2019ve seen that those firms tend to build on [Ethereum],\u201d he said. JPMorgan\u2019s Ethereum-based blockchain, dubbed Onyx, which allows for real-time cross-border money movement is one example. \u201d[Ethereum] is the dominant chain for issuing stablecoins, it\u2019s a dominant market for DeFi, it has been the favored public blockchain for large Wall Street firms to build on it,\u201d Hougan added. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that Solana et al don\u2019t do well as well from this regulatory shift, but I do think there\u2019s specific catalyst for ETH coming out of this regulatory change that help explain why it\u2019s rallying and why I think the outlook there is good.\u201d To be sure, there\u2019s an awareness gap among average investors of bitcoin versus ether. A Harris Poll conducted on behalf of Grayscale showed that while nearly all participants indicated some awareness of bitcoin, just around half were aware of Ethereum, he noted. \u201cThe reality is institutional is still getting its hands around bitcoin,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cWhile there is interest in ETH \u2014 and I think it will increase and I think we\u2019ll see strong ETF flows in ETH in 2025 \u2014 it\u2019s still exceptionally early on the institutional side.\u201d \u201cBitcoin and other alternative assets are still probably front of mind, but ETH is a nice contrarian play,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has long-term tailwinds behind it.

By contrast, Ethereum needs to interact with traditional financial services firms for things like payments, tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). The supportive regulatory environment Trump promised will lead to growth in financial applications that hasn\u2019t been possible in the U.S. under President Joe Biden, Pandl explained. \u201cThe fact that the election results went the way that they did means Ethereum has a strong chance of leading in tokenization, stablecoins and DeFi and really solidifying itself as the global settlement layer for finance,\u201d he added. The market cap for stablecoins spiked 9.5% after the election and now stands at more than $180 billion. The market cap of Tether ( USDT ), which makes up 72% of the stablecoin market, increased 10% and USD Coin ( USDC ) grew 6% since Nov. 5. Ethereum is the main blockchain for both stablecoins. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management \u2014 which also issues a bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) and an ether ETF ( ETHW ) \u2014 said he expects the new Congress to pass stablecoin legislation, which could take the market cap to more than $1 trillion in the next year or two. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a shotgun start of major Wall Street firms who want to make sure they have a foot in the door in crypto, and we\u2019ve seen that those firms tend to build on [Ethereum],\u201d he said. JPMorgan\u2019s Ethereum-based blockchain, dubbed Onyx, which allows for real-time cross-border money movement is one example. \u201d[Ethereum] is the dominant chain for issuing stablecoins, it\u2019s a dominant market for DeFi, it has been the favored public blockchain for large Wall Street firms to build on it,\u201d Hougan added. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that Solana et al don\u2019t do well as well from this regulatory shift, but I do think there\u2019s specific catalyst for ETH coming out of this regulatory change that help explain why it\u2019s rallying and why I think the outlook there is good.\u201d To be sure, there\u2019s an awareness gap among average investors of bitcoin versus ether. A Harris Poll conducted on behalf of Grayscale showed that while nearly all participants indicated some awareness of bitcoin, just around half were aware of Ethereum, he noted. \u201cThe reality is institutional is still getting its hands around bitcoin,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cWhile there is interest in ETH \u2014 and I think it will increase and I think we\u2019ll see strong ETF flows in ETH in 2025 \u2014 it\u2019s still exceptionally early on the institutional side.\u201d \u201cBitcoin and other alternative assets are still probably front of mind, but ETH is a nice contrarian play,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has long-term tailwinds behind it. I think it\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-29 09:35:25","distinguished":null,"edited":"2024-11-29 09:50:52","id":"lzl5257","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1h2f5g1","parent_id":"t3_1h2f5g1","score":39,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/epic_trader","body":">ether\u2019s supply rose despite a previous tech upgrade that should have had reduced supply.\n\nReally so tiring seeing this shit repeated over and over.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>ether\u2019s supply rose despite a previous tech upgrade that should have had reduced supply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Really so tiring seeing this shit repeated over and over.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-11-29 10:03:15","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"lzla061","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1h2f5g1","parent_id":"t1_lzl5257","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/nllfld","body":"Yep.
