The &quot;great works of art&quot; that are known and loved around the world, how were they created? For the most part, the masters who worked on them were commissioned by people willing to pay a fortune for the <em>social status that comes with commissioning and owning the work</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Different NFT projects are valued in different ways by different people. But a lot of what&#39;s going on here is not new, just classic human behavior.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Wanting to fund artists, for social status, or to just get them to keep making more</p></li>\n<li><p>to signal that &quot;you were there&quot; to a certain community</p></li>\n<li><p>to signal your contribution to some charitable cause</p></li>\n<li><p>to pool together funds and launch some crazy new cult/dao/community/scam/unlicensed security offering. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously, that last one is where the boundaries between art and scam get blurry. But blurry boundaries between art and scam have existed as long as art has existed!
