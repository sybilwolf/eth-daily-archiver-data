There is no quantum computer yet which does anything useful. Anything else in their press release is just their marketing department creating a reality distortion field which would even make Steve Jobs proud.\n\nThe reason no quantum computer does anything useful is that no one can properly control enough qubits to be able to run even an minimal version of anything which resembles an algorithm. In the coming years, larger labs might be able to get a minimal algorithm running, but this still means they would need orders of magnitude more qubits on their chips to be dangerous to any encryption algorithm used nowadays. This means even when a minimal version of an algorithm is running on these in the future we will have several years to make Ethereum quantum resistant. \n\nEven longer answer: One of the difficulties scaling quantum computers is the readout and control of single qubits. Every qubit nowadays needs several connections to the outside world to control it. If you need several thousands or ten of thousands of qubits (not 100% sure of the actual numbers here) to actually attack current cryptography you would need several thousands or several tens of thousands of cables from the chip to the outside world. Each of these need to be connected to a measurement and control instrument like this one https://www.zhinst.com/ch/en/products/shfqc-qubit-controller and as far as I understand you need several hundreds to maybe even several tens of thousand of these ones.
