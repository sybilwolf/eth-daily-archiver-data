Ignore for now that the post is about Bitcoin but the key takeaway is that finally the penny is dropping for many tradfi folks that they have been WRONG. There is a sense here that &#39;Okay but this is why I always did index investing so that winners finally are part of my portfolio&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>And once this trend accelerates, no doubt all the new money doesn&#39;t flow just into Bitcoin alone.

The speaker explores potential scenarios where Ethereum's system could face challenges and discusses the importance of global power distribution in the network.

The talk also touches on topics such as programmable cryptography, the risks of centralization in staking, and the promotion of technologies like tees for solving complex problems in the blockchain space.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can Ethereum improve its global power distribution within the network to enhance decentralization and prevent centralization issues, especially in the context of staking?\n\n- In what ways can programmable cryptography and technologies like tees be further leveraged to address complex challenges and promote a more efficient and decentralized blockchain ecosystem on Ethereum?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

They spoke of a few hundred addresses being leaked. When the file finally turned up it was several thousands.</p>\n\n<p>They then boasted to investors how much money their ledgers have under management, showing that they track addresses and users to compile these data. I did not like that.</p>\n\n<p>Then they had a some of their codebase exploited and hackers published malicious code which actually made some people to lose money with normal on-chain transactions. That whole fiasco was so preventable if they just did the minimal part of securing their build toolchain or design the software in a way that if shit hits the fan it does not affect everyone instantly.</p>\n\n<p>And finally they were surprised that people did not like the news that they can extract private keys through a ledger firmware update. They were so surprised about the backlash and wrote a long piece how it was misunderstood and stop the release. They stopped the release for some time and later released it anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I write this all down to show that ledger, the company, is not very good in having the proper mindset and safeguards in place considering the sensitive area they are working in. That is why I try to avoid them in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Funniest thing is, I am pretty sure I missed being in the leaked addresses by just a few hours. If I had ordered another backup Nano S just a few yours earlier I should have appeared in the list according to their post mortem.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-12-15 12:06:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m27ulu6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1hembku","parent_id":"t1_m27n7xv","score":17,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"Let us know how you like it coming from the nano s, I know I'll have some questions","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Let us know how you like it coming from the nano s, I know I&#39;ll have some questions</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2024-12-15 13:24:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m2894qg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1hembku","parent_id":"t1_m27cc3h","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Gumpa-Bucky","body":"I just completed my transition from Ledger Nano S to Trezor 3.
