The panel discussion touched upon topics such as the evolution of terminology from zero knowledge to programmable cryptography, the potential future impact of obfuscation, and the integration of AI with programmable cryptography. They discussed how programmable cryptography could shape future interactions and digital agents, potentially leading to transformative changes in digital communication and autonomy. The panel also addressed questions around the implications of using programmable cryptography for decentralized applications and compliance with regulations. Overall, the discussion highlighted the possibilities and challenges associated with incorporating programmable cryptography into blockchain technologies.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How do you envision the integration of AI with programmable cryptography impacting the development of decentralized applications within the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem?\n\n2.
