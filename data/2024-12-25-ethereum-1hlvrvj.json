Since Frax won&#39;t be buying the T-Bills directly. I think how it works is Frax gets money, they give to Blackrock who buys T-Bills, and gives Frax, BUIDL, in return Frax issues frxUSD to users. On the snapshot it says &quot;Invest in BUIDL as a backing asset for Frax USD&quot; which you can read here <a href=\"https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x77562982f577db75ad2392a84cd00e4e16d585ab3c97ce51229962b756842f15\">https://snapshot.box/#/s:frax.eth/proposal/0x77562982f577db75ad2392a84cd00e4e16d585ab3c97ce51229962b756842f15</a> so it seems silly to do but at the same time it&#39;s the games we play in the US.
