If you want all of these features at a very high level, you will need something big and bulky like a VR headset today or Meta's prototype glasses not for sale that cost like 20k to produce. The sunglasses type that I have (Viture Pro XR) have very limited movement tracking. It's not like the Apple Vision pro where you can lock screens around you. The screen feels great watching movies (I commute a lot) and reading subtitles but word documents or working in excel doesn't feel sharp enough to work comfortably. Opacity is impressively good, you can dim the room with a button or minimize the screen to a bottom corner and take your dog out for a walk while watching something. Also, many people have glasses. These ones can adjust for bad vision (+5 to -5) but most can't. \n\nThe biggest thing is the limited field of view though. My glasses are comparatively sharper and better screens than what's available but the FOV is only 50 degrees. Our eyes see closer to 180 degrees and I would like 100 degrees to work with two screens side by side. They also have a single cord. If we want mainstream adoption, they need to be wireless. \n\nFinal thing but which is probably the smallest obstacle is the support from smartphones isn't there yet. You want to be able to connect them and have a desktop, not phone environment. Samsung has Dex, which is good but on iPhone and Android, you basically screen mirror and screen has to be turned on, so your phone battery drains quickly.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Is it the screen quality?
