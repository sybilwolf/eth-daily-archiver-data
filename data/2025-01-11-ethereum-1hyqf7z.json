The story involves degens, leverage, liquidations, and a protocol managing $1.5B. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n*I don\u2019t have exposure to Usual products and haven\u2019t followed them closely, so I might miss some details. Feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong.*\n\nUsual launched a unique stablecoin product, USD0, in summer 2024. It started slow but saw explosive growth, gaining $1B by December 2024. Today, USD0 is the 6th largest stablecoin, with $1.8B in market cap.\n\n**How does USD0 work?**\n\nAt its core, USD0 is a complex \u201cReal World Asset\u201d (RWA) stablecoin. Users mint USD0 by depositing USDC at a 1:1 ratio. This USDC is then used to purchase short-term US Treasuries, effectively backing USD0. Sounds straightforward, right?\n\nHere\u2019s the twist: Usual offers another token, USD0++. You can mint USD0++ by staking USD0 (1:1). USD0++ holders receive:\n\n1. Yield from treasury bills.\n2. $USUAL, the governance token for the Usual DAO.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: USD0++ is locked for **four years**. While it can be traded on secondary markets, the lockup introduces risk.\n\nAt first glance, 1 USD0++ should equal 1 USD0, but that\u2019s not the case. Why? Locked capital has less value today than in the future. If Treasury yields are 5%, $1 grows to $1.21 over four years. It was implicitely assumed that it works like this, like the LSD/LST staking tokens. ... but that's not case case. It's the other way round. You can redeem 1 USD0++ in 4 years for 1 USD0, thus, it should trade around $0.85 factoring in this yield. Of course, other factors can push the price higher, e.g. the additional $USUAL tokens earned.\n\nTo stabilize USD0++ prices, Usual introduced a floor mechanism, allowing the DAO to buy back USD0++ from secondary markets if prices fall too low. They also promised early redemption options for USD0++, but these features are yet to be implemented.\n\n**A \"depeg\" occured**\n\nSomehow, the market abruptly judged that USD++ should not trade around $1.00, which has been the case of the last months. Some big players abruptly sold USD0++, cause some slight depeg, then a \"full depeg\" happended to a value of $0.9. Also, Usual changed their docs regarding the floor mechanism abruptly, adding fuel to the fire.  There are some rumours / traces that insiders might have known and profited from this depeg scenario. While retail loopers still helding the bag.\n\n**What's the drama?**\n\nThe controversy revolves around how USD0++ was marketed and used:\n\n1. Some \"risk managers\" (MEV Capital, Steakhouse Capital, Gauntlet) created on Morpho money markets with USD0++ to be pegged at $1.\n2. These pegged pools offered high Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios to USD0++. This encouraged looping (borrowing and reinvesting repeatedly) to amplify exposure.\n3. In lending markets with market rate oracles, liquidations would naturally occur in case of a depeg. But in case of hard pegged markets, no liquidations occurs, but naturally lenders would move away capital, spiking borrow rate for borrowers. Borrows can't exit their position (in case of looping), respectively they would realize their loss. So they might keep the position and just not pay back. Leaving bad depts for the depositors.\n4. Because of 3.) happening at Morpho, APY for this pools spiked, up to 60% APY and currently around 30%. That seems attractive on first glance, but is it truly? How big is the risk of bad debt in this pool? IMHO a fairly high risk play (it could be even worth), retail lenders maybe not understand all the risks. Keep in mind, that Morphos pool risk are separated, and work as intended, there is no capital outside of this pools with USD0++ exposure at risk.\n5. Also lending protocols with market rate oracles could have run into issue, because for such a big depeg  there wouldn't have been much liquidity to redeem the funds.\n6. Also some USD0++ pendle pools were also affected. LP and PT-helders are the one bearing this depeg risks.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe recent USD0++ depeg caught many by surprise, but it\u2019s not entirely unexpected when you dig into the mechanics. Degens who leveraged their USD0++ exposure are now paying the price\u2014there\u2019s no free lunch in Defi.Protocols like Pendle and some Morpho users may have been blindsided as well, likely unaware of the risks involved in treating USD0++ as a \"stable asset\". The extent of the damage? Unclear. There might be some relief with some 1:1 redemption.

The closing ceremony highlighted the importance of long-term thinking, the impact of subtraction as a strategy for the future, and the significance of openness, collaboration, and defensive technology in the Ethereum ecosystem. The event showcased the global and vibrant nature of the Ethereum community, with attendees from over 130 countries, an emphasis on improving Ethereum for humanity, and a focus on long-term impact and contribution to the Ethereum project. The event also hinted at the next iterations of Devcon, including DevConnect in the coming years, allowing for deeper dives into specific themes and domains within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe transcript chunk provides insights into proposals for hosting events like DevCon and Ethereum events in Southeast Asia and neighboring countries. There is mention of a forum where proposals can be submitted, highlighting the opportunity for community involvement in hosting events. Additionally, the text touches upon celebrating cultural experiences and the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem in the region, urging participants to engage in various activities during the event. The chunk also recognizes the diverse team and volunteers who contributed to making the event a success, emphasizing the strength of the Ethereum community's diversity.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can the Ethereum community leverage the principles of openness, collaboration, and defensive technology discussed at DevCon to address emerging challenges and opportunities within the ecosystem?\n\n- In what ways do you think hosting Ethereum events in Southeast Asia and neighboring countries can further expand and enrich the global Ethereum community, considering the emphasis on cultural experiences and community involvement as highlighted in the talk summary?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
