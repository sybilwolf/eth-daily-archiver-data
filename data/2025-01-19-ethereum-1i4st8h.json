My life has changed so much in this time. Working in a different industry, setting up a home validator node, meeting you all in Hawaii, moving overseas for a while, returning home, different partners, becoming a Masters student, graduating \ud83e\udd73, going to my first ever Devcon (Devcon 7 SEA), meeting you all again in Phuket for Hodlercon 2, successfully merging with r/Ethereum and then taking a leap of faith and finally finding work in this industry while touring NZ in my camper van with my partner over her summer break and living the absolute dream. What an incredible 1,000 days. Thank you all for being such a cornerstone of this journey. Nothing beats this community online. Nothing even comes close for me. Such amazing things have come from EthFinance, now at home in the r/Ethereum daily threads. We've educated and onboarded so many people, built so many great things together and now at home in r/Ethereum it really does feel like we're only just beginning to scratch the surface of what can be achieved with this community.\n\nSo here's to another 1,000 daily doots, many more new community members and many more new relationships formed and much more infrastructure for a brighter future built.

We hope you enjoy a good sandwich today and even get some sprinkles on your ice cream.  </p>\n\n<p>You are a treasured member of this community and we sincerely thank you for your service to the greater good of Ethereum Reddit.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers and Big Hugs from Kanas City</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: ALMOST FORGOT</p>\n\n<p>spent last night taking all dooters with more than 10 and adding them to the approved users list here.  Over 170 accounts...so if you got a message from the mod team...just know that was because you&#39;ve earned it over time and quality of your contributions.</p>\n\n<p>I also went through automod and took a gander and cleaned up a bunch of stuff to help keep automod from getting too drunk and removing stuff for review.

The question is when. Weeks, months...\n\n\nI think if we enter a full blown mania phase, all LSTs are likely to temporary depeg too.

I just came back to Ethereum and switched back to ETH.\n\nMy thinking was that I could get in relatively early and that it was a good short term play. It launched late in the US, I buy it about 12 hours after launch, on a weekend, on a dex because it's not listed yet on CEXs and sell a couple days later, max a week.\n\nI bought at *the worst* price since launch, so far. I was watching it move from 20, thought a pullback would come but never did. Struggled a bit to move my ETH to Solana without using a CEX and without getting scammed because I have never used a Solana bridge or Solana before. I have heard all the failed TXs and was experiencing it quite a bit. I approved 15 TXs with my hardware wallet on Solana but they all timed out (no cost). The transaction data on Solana is very different from Ethereum. For Ethereum, I can kind of guess what's happening before approving but Solana is a black hole. \"Compute budget program, Instruction 2/4\", is a swap.  Don't know if the Lattice team (hardware wallet) has some work to do or if that is normal. I eventually switched to a different Dex (Raydium) that worked on the first try. I got in at 32, it dumped 30% immediately. I was pissed off at myself and the simulation. It hasn't dropped 30% since at any time, though close recently. I don't hold meme coins or alts anymore, but whenever I did, this *always* happened. I was close to using my mental stop loss and selling. I read on Twitter (falsely) that the FBI and the SEC were investigating. I didn't sell because of a single green candle. It stabilized and went sideways until I went to sleep. \n\nI wake up today, having slept four hours, and price is at 50. I am on my PC the whole day, reading twitter and reddit. I decided to sell about 1 min after the Trump ETH buys happened. I was again having issues selling. Now the dex wasn't working for me. I eventually figured out I made the rookie mistake of not having any SOL in my wallet to pay TX fees. I could still make and approve TXs but they just timed out, same as before with no warning. I bridge more SOL to pay the fee and swap back to SOL. I decide I don't want to hold it and start bridging back. The same bridge gave me an error going the other way, saying my hardware wallet didn't support custom transactions. I find another supposedly reputable bridge, Simpleswap. It works like the old Shapeshift, you send to an address and they send you your requested token back. They took 15 min to process my 1 SOL test TX, while the other bridge (Debridge) took like 30s going the other way. I also read some threads that Simpleswap sometimes scammed people or requested KYC. F that. I tried to get my backup hardware wallet, ledger nano s to work but apparently, the firmware is so old that I can't use smart contracts on Solana, only simple transfers. There is no way I will ever update the firmware on it.\n\nI eventually tried the first bridge again with my Lattice and now it worked. I swapped my SOL to USDC since the bridge fee was much cheaper, 1% fee on 120k is otherwise a lot. I went to Cowswap to swap back to ETH and due to some bug, manage to get quoted a positive slippage of 10%. I approved quickly but the price moved back. It was probably just a glitch you can't actually take advantage of. I looked MEV of recent blocks and it was normal amounts.\n\nQuite an eventful and stressful weekend, not really what I needed but I am glad it worked out. The gain is like two years worth of DCA to me. I don't have anyone IRL I can mention this to.

No matter if you think Trump is a cunt or not, that meant our interests got aligned with the president of the US.\n\nIf you want decentralization to succeed, having powerful allies is a good thing. Just like having powerful enemies is a bad thing (think of Gary Gensler if you need convincing about this).\n\nWhat I don't like at all is that we can now expect a decent portion of the Trump memecoin profits to be reinvested in sol. Remember, so far he reinvested all profit made on Ethereum into eth.\n\n[One source claims](https://x.com/SolanaFloor/status/1880840858913878084) that \"*the $TRUMP team wallet, which deployed liquidity on Meteora's pools, has been actively buying SOL using fees collected from the pools, purchasing $7M worth of SOL so far*.\" I haven't checked it but it would definitely make sense.\n\nProblem is that insiders (mostly Trump of course) apparently hold 80% of a $72B FDV coin, which means that it's not at all crazy to expect Trump will soon have a multi-billion dollar position in sol. He already has a multi-billion position in the Solana ecosystem via his coin after all.\n\nIf he only reinvested 10% of the profit made on Solana into sol, that would be more than $5 billions.\n\nNot only that but Solana is a US based, easily controllable blockchain. They might just have managed to perfectly align their interests with the US.\n\nEthereum is certainly built to be able to face any type of adversity. By design, we must be able to face any nation state enemy.

Rather than using a conventional approach, Pang J implemented a large-scale indexer named Alat tress that leveraged a compact and structured input format called PCKT. The data processing was done in a parallel manner using Apache Beam and storing the processed data in Google Bigtable. The process took around 10 hours, cost $350, and resulted in 7.1 billion records being written to the database, showcasing efficient scaling capabilities. The talk also touched on making the indexing process real-time after the initial indexing was completed.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nHow does the implementation of the Alat tress indexer and the use of Apache Beam contribute to the efficient processing and scaling of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain compared to conventional approaches?\n\n\n\nWhat are the potential challenges and considerations in transitioning from batch processing to real-time indexing of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, and how might these challenges be addressed effectively?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
