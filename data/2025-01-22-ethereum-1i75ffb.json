We need to align that the price of ETH going up is GOOD for Ethereum and the future. The way we get the price to go up in part\u00a0is we massively push positive news and grab attention.\u00a0Ethereum is the best project in crypto by FAR and basically the only thing actually worth spending time on trying to build. But building means, we build attention, hype, and a shit ton of money into it, not just technical and moral superiorities.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-22 01:34:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m8ie0xt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i75ffb","parent_id":"t3_1i75ffb","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hanniabu","body":"My favorite clip from devconnect\n\n[https://x.com/paulbarrontv/status/1866581875759943860](https://x.com/paulbarrontv/status/1866581875759943860)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>My favorite clip from devconnect</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/paulbarrontv/status/1866581875759943860\">https://x.com/paulbarrontv/status/1866581875759943860</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-22 10:26:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m8kvq5h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i75ffb","parent_id":"t1_m8ie0xt","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/CryptoChief","body":">  when they invested in Consensys\n\nEmbrace, extend, extinguish?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>when they invested in Consensys</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Embrace, extend, extinguish?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-23 05:02:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m8pt5bb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i75ffb","parent_id":"t1_m8ie0xt","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/growthepie_eth","body":"Ethereum is dominating in Stablecoins:  \n\\- In the past 30 days over $10 Million worth of ETH was spent in transferring stablecoins on Ethereum L1  \n\\- Ethereum Layer  1 is at a yearly high in Stablecoin Marketcap  \n\\- Ethereum Ecosystem (L1 + L2s) is hitting another all time high in Stablecoin Marketcap  \n\\- Ethereum has the largest share of stablecoins of any chain - money is literally moving towards Ethereum","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum is dominating in Stablecoins:<br/>\n- In the past 30 days over $10 Million worth of ETH was spent in transferring stablecoins on Ethereum L1<br/>\n- Ethereum Layer  1 is at a yearly high in Stablecoin Marketcap<br/>\n- Ethereum Ecosystem (L1 + L2s) is hitting another all time high in Stablecoin Marketcap<br/>\n- Ethereum has the largest share of stablecoins of any chain - money is literally moving towards Ethereum</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-01-22 05:37:13","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"m8j7ibf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1i75ffb","parent_id":"t3_1i75ffb","score":28,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/cryptrd285","body":"INTRODUCING ETHEREALIZE\n\nAn institutional marketing and product arm for the @ethereum ecosystem\n\nOur goal?

In his last year at the EF he spent a lot of time trying to analyze and verbalize the dangers of having a lot of ETH under the control of single protocols, DAOs and contracts. I am not sure if Danny ever explicitly mentioned Lido, but it was clear to everyone that Lido is meant among others. Danny explicitly mentioned that having most ETH staked is not a good outcome for the same reasons. These statements are in direct opposition to Lidos goals, which are: 'Most ETH will be staked and stETH will be the majority of it'. In short, having Danny back would limit their future growth possibilities. That was why I was wondering how they would tackle this. And yes, having an antipope (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope) is a possible way to subvert the legitimacy of the EF and their goals. \n\nAs always, I could be very wrong and in this case I really hope I am. It might be they are building a non-overlapping organization besides the EF which does important stuff for the space and help institutions. If done properly they might make a good profit from these endeavors. And Lido people have shown that they can build very profitable businesses.

In his last year at the EF he spent a lot of time trying to analyze and verbalize the dangers of having a lot of ETH under the control of single protocols, DAOs and contracts. I am not sure if Danny ever explicitly mentioned Lido, but it was clear to everyone that Lido is meant among others. Danny explicitly mentioned that having most ETH staked is not a good outcome for the same reasons. These statements are in direct opposition to Lidos goals, which are: &#39;Most ETH will be staked and stETH will be the majority of it&#39;. In short, having Danny back would limit their future growth possibilities. That was why I was wondering how they would tackle this. And yes, having an antipope (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope</a>) is a possible way to subvert the legitimacy of the EF and their goals. </p>\n\n<p>As always, I could be very wrong and in this case I really hope I am.

He highlighted the prevalence of web 2-based attacks on web 3 and DeFi systems, particularly focusing on threats originating from the domain name system (DNS) and how these attacks target users through fake airdrops and malicious smart contracts. To combat these threats, Alex proposed a collaborative approach involving sharing intelligence about malicious domains, conducting takedowns, blacklisting fraudulent websites, and utilizing the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) to reclaim domains. The presentation emphasized the need for collective action within the community to address these security challenges proactively.\n\n\n\nMalika Gaza, a legal research associate at ENS, elaborated on the strategies employed to combat malicious activities, such as reporting to hosting providers, blacklisting fraudulent websites, and submitting UDRP complaints. The speakers advocated for a unified effort to reclaim malicious domains, sharing intelligence, and leveraging legal mechanisms to address the persistent threats to the Ethereum ecosystem. They encouraged collaboration among community members to collectively combat bad actors and enhance the security of web 3 and DeFi platforms.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can the Ethereum community effectively collaborate and implement the proposed strategies to combat malicious activities and enhance security within the ecosystem?\n\n- In what ways can the utilization of legal mechanisms like the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) contribute to creating a more secure environment for web 3 and DeFi platforms?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
