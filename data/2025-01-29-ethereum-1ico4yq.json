So we would publish most of the program and we would keep the secret key hidden. And then by having that encrypted within the IO box, we can ensure that the output and the behavior of the program is correct without revealing the entire program itself. So this allows for programmability while maintaining the security and secrecy of the underlying operations. And in terms of verifying correctness, other people can verify the output of the program by checking the signatures produced by the IO box, ensuring that it aligns with the expected results without needing to expose the underlying details of the program itself. So it's a way to have both transparency and security in the computation process.\n\nThe transcript discusses topics related to programmable cryptography and its applications, including zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), interactive oracle proofs (IO), and exotic cryptographic assumptions. It explores the concept of programmable privacy enabled by ZK snarks and the evolution of mental models on how to approach programmable cryptography. The speaker emphasizes the importance of grounding ideas in reality through building prototypes, testing new mental models, and addressing challenges like interactivity and scalability. Additionally, reflections on the nature of encryption and agency within cryptographic systems are presented, hinting at the potential for novel applications in building decentralized systems with global private state.
