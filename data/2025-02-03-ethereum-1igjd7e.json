In PoS, it's just a shuffle: It's money moved from one ETH holder to another ETH holder. Stakers are ETH holders, and holding the ETH gives you the right to stake. If we print some money to pay a staker, the change to the average ETH holder is zero: There's a + for the staking ETH holder, offset by a - to the non-staking ETH holder. If we change the protocol to cut the block reward or burn more ETH, the change to the average ETH holder is also zero: There's a - for the staking ETH holder, offset by a + to the non-staking ETH holder.\n\nMEV is revenue that goes to a staking ETH holder. If we make a way to burn it, that will be a shuffle from the staking ETH holder to the non-staking ETH holder, but the net effect across all ETH holders will also be zero. That's because MEV does in fact accrue to ETH holders: ETH holders who use their ETH to stake.\n\nNow, it's true that some ETH holders don't stake, so they don't get all the revenue coming in, and it instead goes to the ETH holders who do. You can think of them like shareholders who don't cash their dividend cheques. But some shareholders not cashing their dividend cheques doesn't alter the revenue to the company. And even if you're not cashing your dividend cheque this year, the shares you hold give you (or anyone you sell your shares to) the right to future dividends, so if the company develops a new product that will make it more revenue and it intends to pay it out as future dividends, that makes your shares more valuable, even though you didn't collect the dividend this year.\n\nSo the revenue for ETH holders is MEV + fees paid, regardless of whether they're burned or collected by stakers. From that you need to subtract the actual cost of running the validator hardware (not the amount that stakers get paid), but that's pretty tiny.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>OK so there&#39;s some confusion here which I blame on the &quot;ultrasound money&quot; people who got really enthusiastic about an EIP and misguidedly brought over some intuitions from PoW that don&#39;t apply to PoS.</p>\n\n<p>In PoW, issuance is a cost: It&#39;s money printed and spent, most of it not even ending up with the miner. In PoS, it&#39;s just a shuffle: It&#39;s money moved from one ETH holder to another ETH holder. Stakers are ETH holders, and holding the ETH gives you the right to stake. If we print some money to pay a staker, the change to the average ETH holder is zero: There&#39;s a + for the staking ETH holder, offset by a - to the non-staking ETH holder. If we change the protocol to cut the block reward or burn more ETH, the change to the average ETH holder is also zero: There&#39;s a - for the staking ETH holder, offset by a + to the non-staking ETH holder.</p>\n\n<p>MEV is revenue that goes to a staking ETH holder. If we make a way to burn it, that will be a shuffle from the staking ETH holder to the non-staking ETH holder, but the net effect across all ETH holders will also be zero. That&#39;s because MEV does in fact accrue to ETH holders: ETH holders who use their ETH to stake.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it&#39;s true that some ETH holders don&#39;t stake, so they don&#39;t get all the revenue coming in, and it instead goes to the ETH holders who do. You can think of them like shareholders who don&#39;t cash their dividend cheques. But some shareholders not cashing their dividend cheques doesn&#39;t alter the revenue to the company. And even if you&#39;re not cashing your dividend cheque this year, the shares you hold give you (or anyone you sell your shares to) the right to future dividends, so if the company develops a new product that will make it more revenue and it intends to pay it out as future dividends, that makes your shares more valuable, even though you didn&#39;t collect the dividend this year.</p>\n\n<p>So the revenue for ETH holders is MEV + fees paid, regardless of whether they&#39;re burned or collected by stakers. From that you need to subtract the actual cost of running the validator hardware (not the amount that stakers get paid), but that&#39;s pretty tiny.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-03 03:17:49","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-02-03 03:22:14","id":"mapwzts","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1igjd7e","parent_id":"t1_mapv576","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"[deleted]","body":"[deleted]","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>[deleted]</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-03 03:29:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mapyb2u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1igjd7e","parent_id":"t1_mapwzts","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/edmundedgar","body":"> It's money moved from one ETH holder to another ETH holder.\" But at the same time, it's also revenue.

She highlighted the use of encumbrance to share or rent the right to sign with private keys, breaking the assumption that private keys are held by one entity. Dark Dows were identified as decentralized cartels buying on-chain votes opaquely. The discussion included implications for various systems, such as quadratic voting/funding, NFTs, airdrops, and multisigs, and emphasized the need for defenses like Proof of Complete Knowledge (CK) utilizing trusted execution environments (TEEs). The importance of addressing undetectable encumbrance and the potential impact of liquifaction were also explored, with suggestions for community efforts and research on TEEs.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How might the concept of dark Dows and private coordination challenge the current assumptions around decentralized governance in blockchain networks like Ethereum, and what potential risks or benefits could this bring to the ecosystem?\n\n\n\n2. In what ways could the development of defenses like Proof of Complete Knowledge using trusted execution environments impact the ability to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities related to undetectable encumbrance in blockchain systems, and how could this shape the future of security measures in the industry?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
