Thankfully, the Ethereum Foundation has uploaded all of the presentations onto Youtube, [so you can watch it if you want!](https://youtu.be/hOrDqlGcmJE?si=uP73LXIOtxob9Qxe)\n\nThe presentation is titled: *Next Generation AMMs - Eliminating LVR*. It is (naturally..) focused on the topic of MEV on AMMs, and in particular it goes into a deep dive on Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR).\n\nI quote from the video description: \"*LVR is the most significant form of MEV, yet it has the fewest solutions addressing it. LVR remains a significant challenge for AMMs. This session delves into a comprehensive analysis of how CoW AMM addresses the problem of LVR through its unique batch mechanism. Drawing from 9 months of empirical data, the talk will explore the effectiveness of CoW AMM in mitigating LVR and offer insights into the impact of LVR resistant design on trading outcomes and market efficiency\"*\n\nBelow is some additional information I gathered from various Cow Protocol [blog](https://blog.cow.fi/) posts:\n\n[What is](https://blog.cow.fi/what-is-loss-versus-rebalancing-lvr-128aa8c6e636) Loss-Versus-Rebalancing? \"\n\n*\"LVR is a form of arbitrage that occurs whenever an AMM has an outdated (stale) price in comparison to some other trading venue.*\n\n*Arbitrageurs exploit this difference by trading from the AMM to the more liquid exchange (usually a centralized exchange like Binance), correcting the arbitrage and extracting value from LPs in the process.*\n\n*...*\n\n*Rather than leaving your money in an AMM or simply holding, in a rebalancing portfolio you trade your way up the price curve when it\u2019s going up and trade down when it\u2019s going down, effectively \u201crebalancing\u201d your portfolio in real time.*\n\n***\u201cLoss-versus-rebalancing\u201d is the difference in value between an LP portfolio and a rebalancing portfolio.\"***","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey friends! I just read <a href=\"/u/haurog\">u/haurog</a> comment (slightly below) on the new Balancer v3, which is a fantastic write-up. This made me remember an excellent presentation I watched while in Devcon some months ago, by Cow Protocol&#39;s Anna George. Thankfully, the Ethereum Foundation has uploaded all of the presentations onto Youtube, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hOrDqlGcmJE?si=uP73LXIOtxob9Qxe\">so you can watch it if you want!</a></p>\n\n<p>The presentation is titled: <em>Next Generation AMMs - Eliminating LVR</em>. It is (naturally..) focused on the topic of MEV on AMMs, and in particular it goes into a deep dive on Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR).</p>\n\n<p>I quote from the video description: &quot;<em>LVR is the most significant form of MEV, yet it has the fewest solutions addressing it. LVR remains a significant challenge for AMMs. This session delves into a comprehensive analysis of how CoW AMM addresses the problem of LVR through its unique batch mechanism. Drawing from 9 months of empirical data, the talk will explore the effectiveness of CoW AMM in mitigating LVR and offer insights into the impact of LVR resistant design on trading outcomes and market efficiency&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>Below is some additional information I gathered from various Cow Protocol <a href=\"https://blog.cow.fi/\">blog</a> posts:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.cow.fi/what-is-loss-versus-rebalancing-lvr-128aa8c6e636\">What is</a> Loss-Versus-Rebalancing? &quot;</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;LVR is a form of arbitrage that occurs whenever an AMM has an outdated (stale) price in comparison to some other trading venue.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Arbitrageurs exploit this difference by trading from the AMM to the more liquid exchange (usually a centralized exchange like Binance), correcting the arbitrage and extracting value from LPs in the process.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>...</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Rather than leaving your money in an AMM or simply holding, in a rebalancing portfolio you trade your way up the price curve when it\u2019s going up and trade down when it\u2019s going down, effectively \u201crebalancing\u201d your portfolio in real time.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\u201cLoss-versus-rebalancing\u201d is the difference in value between an LP portfolio and a rebalancing portfolio.&quot;</em></strong></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-05 04:13:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mb3ddi4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ii4did","parent_id":"t3_1ii4did","score":19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"Thanks this post and for the link to the talk. I heard about COW AMM quite often, but never bothered to read up on it. COW AMM is also built on top of balancer v3. It is interesting how large the design space for AMMs still is and how one can increase their efficiency even further. \n\nAs far as I understood COW AMM uses batching windows in which all swaps get cleared at the same price, meaning arbitrageurs will have to share all the MEV gain they could have had with all the people in the same batch and the liquidity providers. This setup levels the playing field between sophisticated actors and passive actors quite a bit.

They discussed details of the Balancer v3 release as well. These are the points which stuck with me.\n\n- They keep fungible pool tokens as they saw the negative effect the concentrated non-fungible pool tokens bring. This means that there aren't MEV extractors which can just frontrun large swaps with concentrated liquidity deployment to extract the fees. There are also protocols like Gyroscope which built concentrated liquidity pools on top of fungible pool tokens on balancer. This sounds like one can have concentrated liquidity together with non-fungible pool tokens. \n\n- They also have hooks similar to Uniswap v4. No idea who had the idea first, but they said they had to rename a few things to use the same terminology as uniswap to make development on balancer easier for people who developed on uniswap\n\n- One interesting hook is that the pool is aware of the priority fee paid by the transaction, so if one pays a very high priority fee there is a big chance that this is a MEV bot, extracting value. In that case, the swap fee increases automatically and gets distributed to the liquidity providers.\n\n- They have a vaults system, where most of the liquidity is deposited to aave and only when needed it will be taken out of aave and be used in the swap. This means there you earn aave yield while providing liquidity. This only works with yield bearing tokens which follow the ERC-4626 standard. I guess aave follows this, maybe other protocols as well.\n\n- Balancer helped launching the on-chain ETF bCSPX together with backed.fi. Not sure if balancer v3 was strictily necessary for this or not.\n\nI do not expect the two MEV mitigation techniques (swap fee depending on priority fee and fungible pool tokens) to be the end all be all for MEV mitigation, but they definitely help. \n\nAs a caveat I am not knowledgeable enough to make a nuanced analysis how important this balancer upgrade is, especially in comparison of uniswap v4.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I just listened to the epicenter podcast with Fernando Martinelli from Balancer about their v3 release: <a href=\"https://epicenter.tv/episodes/584\">https://epicenter.tv/episodes/584</a></p>\n\n<p>Was an interesting discussion about AMMs, their origin and their future.

The speakers discuss how memes are crucial in shaping culture within the crypto community.

Additionally, they highlight how memes influence behavior, market dynamics, and even government policy, exemplified by figures like Elon Musk using meme culture for impact. The talk underscores the importance of understanding memes' role in shaping identities, ideologies, and power dynamics within the crypto space.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nHow do memes in crypto culture serve as vehicles for shaping market dynamics and influencing behavior within the community?\n\n\n\nIn what ways can the utilization of memes, as highlighted by figures like Elon Musk, impact government policy and decisions within the crypto space?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

This is certainly not unusual, depending on device compatibility.\n\nProvided the same algorithm is used on a given device, a seed phrase completely defines the \"wallet\" (or rather, the entire sequence of wallet key pairs that may be generated from the seed).

AFAIK there is usually a lot of compatibility between devices (both hot and cold wallets).\n\nAn easy way to check (although tedious) would simply be to program the Trezor with your seed, and see if it generates the same keys.
