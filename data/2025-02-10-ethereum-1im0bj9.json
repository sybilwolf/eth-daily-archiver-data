He emphasized that privacy is crucial for building trust and accountability in online spaces. Zach highlighted the history of privacy technology, including zero-knowledge proofs, and how it can revolutionize blockchain and information networks. He explained how privacy technology allows for trust infrastructure, composable decentralized protocols, and the transformation of web 3.0 into a more user-centric and private ecosystem. Zach also addressed the challenges of censorship risks with on-chain IDs and the limitations of smart contracts on privacy-preserving chains. Ultimately, he emphasized the need for integrating privacy technology to make Ethereum cypherpunk again and foster a more transparent and composable blockchain ecosystem.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1.

The way you wrote it it sounds like you are aware of some of the possible issues with this approach so my points below criticizing this approach might not be new to you.\n\nThe Gompertz function has 3 free parameters whereas the Bitcoin rainbow chart has 2. It is not surprising that this function fits the 3 datapoints better. Any function with 3 independent parameters can be fitted to 3 datapoints. To make such an approach more believable one must have a good reason to use a specific function. This brings me to the next part.\n\nIt looks like the Gompertz function inherently assumes that there is a saturation point. This makes sense if you try to fit technology adoption (percentage of population using it), but not so much USD denominated price increase. For percentage of users there is a obvious saturation at 100% of people using it. With a price increase there is no obvious saturation. Simply said, there might be an infinite amount of USD in the future and if you price something against USD the price could become infinitely large. No saturation anywhere. Even over a short time span where currency debasement is not an issue there is also no clear reason to assume that there is a saturation anywhere. This means that one of the basic properties of the function is not met, so it probably should not be used.\n\nOne interesting question would be if the red and the green curve end up in the same saturation level. Or was one of the fitting conditions that they end up at the same saturation level, that is why you only used two points in the lower curve?\n\nWe will see how well it fits in the coming year or so. If Bitcoin goes to 150k-200k this would be way above your current fit. If not we will see if the fit holds in the next cycle.\n\nI personally think the price is so speculative it is difficult to just pick the speculative frenzy peaks and try to fit a curve to it. Sure, a logarithmic scale helps a bit as it glosses over volatility a bit. If you look at the lower price band however, this is much more 'smooth' over many years. There is a large time range where I think I can see the lower price to follow a curve by just looking at the chart. Interestingly, the rainbow chart can still fit that lower part of the curve pretty well. It is just the peaks it failed obviously.\n\nIn summary, thanks for doing this, I am just not convinced that this is the correct approach. But as always I could be wrong and Bitcoin will just saturate at around 150k or so and never ever go above it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks, I like this kind of stuff. The way you wrote it it sounds like you are aware of some of the possible issues with this approach so my points below criticizing this approach might not be new to you.</p>\n\n<p>The Gompertz function has 3 free parameters whereas the Bitcoin rainbow chart has 2. It is not surprising that this function fits the 3 datapoints better. Any function with 3 independent parameters can be fitted to 3 datapoints. To make such an approach more believable one must have a good reason to use a specific function. This brings me to the next part.</p>\n\n<p>It looks like the Gompertz function inherently assumes that there is a saturation point. This makes sense if you try to fit technology adoption (percentage of population using it), but not so much USD denominated price increase. For percentage of users there is a obvious saturation at 100% of people using it. With a price increase there is no obvious saturation. Simply said, there might be an infinite amount of USD in the future and if you price something against USD the price could become infinitely large. No saturation anywhere. Even over a short time span where currency debasement is not an issue there is also no clear reason to assume that there is a saturation anywhere. This means that one of the basic properties of the function is not met, so it probably should not be used.</p>\n\n<p>One interesting question would be if the red and the green curve end up in the same saturation level. Or was one of the fitting conditions that they end up at the same saturation level, that is why you only used two points in the lower curve?</p>\n\n<p>We will see how well it fits in the coming year or so. If Bitcoin goes to 150k-200k this would be way above your current fit. If not we will see if the fit holds in the next cycle.</p>\n\n<p>I personally think the price is so speculative it is difficult to just pick the speculative frenzy peaks and try to fit a curve to it. Sure, a logarithmic scale helps a bit as it glosses over volatility a bit. If you look at the lower price band however, this is much more &#39;smooth&#39; over many years. There is a large time range where I think I can see the lower price to follow a curve by just looking at the chart. Interestingly, the rainbow chart can still fit that lower part of the curve pretty well. It is just the peaks it failed obviously.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, thanks for doing this, I am just not convinced that this is the correct approach. But as always I could be wrong and Bitcoin will just saturate at around 150k or so and never ever go above it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-10 12:04:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mc2jzt3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1im0bj9","parent_id":"t1_mc1s12j","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/actualbadger","body":"Thanks for the thoughtful comments and I agree with all your points.
