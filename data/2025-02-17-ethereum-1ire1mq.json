It's been a little over three years since Ethereum hit its last ATH. So for me, prices have been going down for 20% of the time I've owned crypto, with some relief rallies to $4k even. That's not very long at all. But I know I'm not an average investor.

Everyone thought it was dead, and they were deleting their wallets along with their 300MB copies of the blockchain. I was also there in 2018 when Ethereum crashed from $1400 to $85 and the ethfinance daily had the energy of a funeral. It always comes back.
