The tool aims to make risks more personalized and visible to users, potentially suggesting mitigations for certain risks, such as different bridging paths for tokens like USDC. Attendees inquire about incorporating additional data into L2 beat, detecting scams in real-time, and analyzing various types of risks beyond just decentralized exchanges.

Not sure which ones natively do that.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty sure Monerium is still not able to interact with the safe itself, so that&#39;s why you can&#39;t use that to make onchain transactions. </p>\n\n<p>It also makes it currently impossible to send bank transfers out from your Gnosis wallet, because Monerium wants you to sign with the safe&#39;s address, which you can&#39;t. Unfortunately this means if you want to make outgoing bank transactions you need to create a seperate sub account in Monerium and tie that one to your IBAN. So basically any bank transfer can go to/from your Monerium account and then you need to send the onchain tx manually yourself between the Gnosis Pay address and that... an annoying extra step that&#39;ll hopefully get solved soon.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-21 08:22:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"me0e41w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iukyyr","parent_id":"t1_me0aszs","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/AuspiciousEther","body":"So it looks like I'm (partly) trying things that just aren't implemented yet...\n\n\n>So you'd need a wallet that supports safe, I suppose.
