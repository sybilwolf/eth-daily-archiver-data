What they can do however is propose blocks, without attesting. With enough blocks, the chain can handle attestations and slowly bleed out the non attesting validators without bleeding ETH themselves. That is exactly what the plan is at the moment: get as many validators online, but keep the slashing database intact.

As always there are different viewpoints, the fundamentalists saying these were the rules everyone agreed to, so we should follow them. Whereas other ones mention that slashing these validators does nothing in improving the security of Ethereum which was the goal of slashing and a social consensus should be reached to give them amnesty. There was also some input from EVMavericks and ethfinance community members which was well received stating that slashing all these validators in a real incident would lead capital to flee Ethereum and be a death sentence for the chain even though it might have been saved technically. \n\nAll in all client devs are improving their clients to handle situations like this better. Core devs play through many different possibilities to get holesky back on track and see what rescuing such a network entails. \n\nI personally was not able to sync the valid chain yet. I have 32 GB RAM shared across a few nodes. This limits me quite a bit. Lighthouse is very RAM hungry on this non finality state. Lodestar also turns off every 20 minutes for me due to memory usage. Nimbus, which was my goto client for situations like these does not seem to work very well with the many forks that are out there. More RAM will be delivered tomorrow I hope that this will be good enough. \n\nThe discussion on how to go forward with pectra is also ongoing and there seems to be no objection towards Pectra on Sepolia.

Renzo appreciates that there was a period of no slashing, where operators and AVSs could \"speed date\" and get to know each other, though recently they've been de-registering from AVSs that they see as vaporware or otherwise have no concrete plan to pay operators.\n* The second was a talk by Alon Muroch of SSV, describing their vision for \"based applications\". This is part of their larger SSV 2.0 effort, which involves some new ERC-20 \"tickets\" which users can earn (e.g. through staking), and use as payment for based applications. The actual description of based applications was, well, a mess. I wasn't sure if I missed something, but judging from the questions at the end, I was not alone in my confusion. My understanding afterwards is that they're basically just creating a restaking platform with a lot of similarities to EigenLayer. I don't know if there's any difference between a \"based application\" and an AVS.

Wormhole handles a billion messages (I think the graph said weekly) valued at 50 billion, and can work in a variety of ways for tokens and NFTs and even more, acting in a way like Stripe does in the tradfi space for plug and play commerce uses. Wormhole also launched that morning a settlement module that uses intents to allow a user to do cross chain swaps, swaps and actions, chain abstraction and more all within a finality cycle.\u00a0\n\n\nI went offsite again to the Preconf.erence hosted by SSV and focusing on preconfimrations, execution markets, credible commits, and shared sequencing. The first chat I saw was \"Makking Interop FAST\" moderated by Josh Bowen of Astria, with Can Kisagun of T1, Ismael Hishon-Rezaizaded of Lagrange, Mayur Relekar of Arcana, and Irfan Shaik of Interstate (he mentioned something in his intro about sidecar software that can help home stakers increase profitability, I need to look into that). The talk was a little disjointed, as it seemed to focus on bridges and most of the panelists aren't in the business of bridges, but mainly discussed how users want fast and cheap bridges and sacrifice security, until a bridge hack happens and there's a big freak out until everyone forgets. Again mentioned the XKCD Nebraska comic.\n\n\nFinal talk I watched there was \"Restaking for a Faster Ethereum\" moderated by Juan Gadea of Obol, with Wes Floyd of Eigenlayer, Lucas Kozenski of Renzo, Jorge Sanchez of Blockdaemon and Cody from Obol (he wasn't on the schedule so I didn't catch is last name). Eigen, and Renzo with them, are excited to debut slashing soon, and have seen the user base go from native Ethereans to more offchain commercial enttites like cloud providers and others looking for trusted decentralization. Renzo is excited that with slashing they will finally meet their V1 goals from two years ago, and want to move beyond the LRT phase, which was just the easiest place to start. With that Eigen and Renzo are working on the chicken and egg problem of AVSs and rewards for them and operators; Redstone on Renzo will launch soon to pay out Eth for preconfirmations, and their accompanying project on Solana is rapidly catching up. Obol is thinking about a lightweight AVS client that home stakers could deploy, perhaps a distributed one just like their staking product.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>As I walked to another stage, there was a EDM/rap style song about L2s and commits and stuff that sounded neat, my phone couldn&#39;t ID it though.</p>\n\n<p>Watched a presentation by Lincoln Murr and Josh Nickerson of Coinbase Developer Platform and AI.

He highlighted the need for standardized protocols to enable seamless communication between different wallets and apps, emphasizing the challenges faced by app developers in vendor-locking users and the fragmented nature of current wallet interactions. Greg outlined key ERCs and capabilities such as pass keys, embedded wallets, and chain-agnostic improvement proposals like CAPE 275 to streamline onboarding and permission management. He also touched on the potential for enhanced user permissions and expressive app development through protocols like ERC 7715 and 7579, with a vision towards multi-chain asset management and improved communication channels for remote accounts in the near future.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\nHow can standardizing wallet protocols like ERCs and implementing features such as pass keys and embedded wallets enhance user experience and accessibility in interacting with smart contract wallets, particularly in a multi-chain environment?\n\n\n\nIn what ways can the adoption of chain-agnostic improvement proposals like CAPE 275 and the development of protocols like ERC 7715 and 7579 contribute to the evolution of wallet standards and facilitate more expressive and secure app development within the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.

Also the solutions all have pros and cons, and in no scenario does Bitcoin come out retaining the ideological purity that people value it for.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-02-27 23:48:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mf7v2r9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1iz9yjg","parent_id":"t1_mf7tie2","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/harpocryptes","body":"An L2 does not solve the L1 becoming insecure.\n\nIn theory, any change is possible with a hardfork, including switching to proof of stake.

My questions are:\n\n\\- Is there verifiable proof that the etfs are backed 1:1?\n\n\\- If they're backed 1:1 with the underlying asset, how long do the brokers of the etf have before they need to purchase the underlying asset on behalf of the client?\n\nIf there isn't verifiable proof that the etfs are backed 1:1, I believe we've been fully captured by tradefi and all price movements are completely inorganic.  This may be taken as bullish or bearish depending on your opinion of brokers and MMs.\n\nMy reasoning is that if we can't prove etfs are backed 1:1, then we have considerable rehypothecation risk.  Example: \n\n1. Joe buys 1 ETH etf share.\n\n2. Joe's broker lends the etf share to institutional investor for shorting purposes. (They sell the share).\n\n3. Fred buys 1 ETH etf share (presumably from the institution that shorted the share).\n\n4. Fred's broker lends the etf share to institutional investor for shorting purposes.\n\n5. Cycle repeats...\n\nThe net result of these trades if backed 1:1 is neutral buying/selling pressure because Joe and Fred both have an actual unit of ETH backing their purchase.  Eventually the there will not be enough ETH in the market at a given price, and risk for the shorter increases dramatically.\n\nThe net result of these trades if **not** backed 1:1 is also presumably neutral because no real ETH actually changed hands and therefore supply/demand forces were not placed on the tangible ETH market.  However, if that's the case it would result in a tail wagging the dog situation where tradefi is naming an arbitrary price to buy/sell ETH at which has a price controlling effect on the real ETH markets.  \n\nThis unbacked scenario would ultimately result in paper trading scenario with infinite liquidity to replace real buy pressure (ETF buyers) with fake/paper buy pressure and every purchase is matched with short.  The price will effectively be driven to wherever brokers and market makers can create the most transactional fees and trade against retail ETF positions.  No real supply driven buy pressure will ever be realized in the tangible ETH markets.  Prices will move up only because there is enough retail to dump on at a higher price and later shake off at a retail loss.\n\nI believe a staking etf would help alleviate this risk since fees would need to be paid to etf holders even if they are just paper positions behind the curtain.  However, we don't know what the return structure of staking etfs will be.  Brokers may claim most of it for themselves.  The pessimist in me also believes that we haven't seen more filings for staking etfs for a reason.  It may be more profitable to not offer it and keep the current game going.\n\nAnyhow, do we have actual proof that these etf 'inflows' are resulting in actual ETH or BTC purchases?
