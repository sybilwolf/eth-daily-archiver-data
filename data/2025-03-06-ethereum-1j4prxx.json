People forgot about holesky a bit in the last few days and were also waiting what the plan actually is for the testnet. That is why participation dropped. In todays ACD call it was made clear that they want holesky to finalize again. So, there is a push to get as many node operators as possible online again. There are some public beacon nodes where one can direct their validator clients to. This should make sure as many people as possible will be up. Not sure if it is enough though to reach finality soon. \n\nLodestar said that they improved their client massively and do not see any memory issue with it anymore even with extended no-finality for weeks. Lighthouse seems to work ok for some and Nimbus seems to work as well for some. I use Lodestar for a few days now and it is pretty stable considering the network conditions.\n\nAbout 27% of all validators on holesky are now in the exit queue. These are mostly validators who have not been online since the borked upgrade. Under the current churn, it will take over 230 days to exit them all. More and more validators are also entering the exit queue. Now validators who have been online only for a few attestations since the upgrade are getting exited. The churn will increase as it is now apparently not defined by number of validators anymore (8), but by the amount of ETH that can exit the beacon chain per epoch (256 ETH). The lower the ETH amount per exiting validator, the more validators can exit per epoch. \n\nIn the ACD call they did the math and said that around the 28th of March holesky should reach finality again (~22 days). At the current rate (last 4 hours) an offline validator leaks about 0.8 ETH per day. My online ones leak about 0.1 ETH per day as they miss a few attestations due to the unstable network conditions. Thins means the first of my validators will enter the exit queue in about 10 days and the last one in about 16 days. If the network does not improve massively I am not sure I will be able to keep my validators alive even if I would try my hardest. And this is probably true for many of the 'professional' node operators as well. Some of their nodes already are in the exit queue. Overall, this is pretty similar to the initial botched holesky genesis and rescue operation where we saw that even if we are online all the time we leak too much ETH and will be exited before we reach the supermajority. Back then we were only about 5-10% of the network. Now, about 30-60% of the validators are online, but due to the bad network condition we might still lose many online validators.\n\nIt could be, that the lowering of the effective balance of the offline validators will help in having more blocks proposed which in turn improves the attestation efficiency and thus reduces the leakage for online validators. A finalization in the next few days might also help in stabilizing the network and improve the overall attestation efficiency as well. We will see if we manage to do this.\n\nAddendum: My leakage lowered quite a bit over the last 12 hours. It is now at 0.045 ETH per day. If it stays like that, my validators might make it after all.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Some holesky update.

Now obviously there is a desired ratio of gold holdings to security guards. If this gets too out of balance some thieves are going to rob the gold vault. No gold mine is infinite though so over time the gold being mined depletes so there is less available from there to pay the security guards.

Doubling the price of gold doesn't help this situation. The only solutions in the long term are to either continuously increase the foot traffic bill as much as is needed to pay enough security guards until people get pissed enough that they take their gold to a different vault with a better security model which winds down the shitty vault to 0 holdings over time, change the billing structure to be based on holdings instead of foot traffic which amounts to a wealth tax, or find an infinite gold mine so there is a sustainable subsidized security budget.\n\nThe gold in the vault is the market cap of BTC here. Either blockspace fees need to increase to offset any inflation decrease, a chain wide wealth tax on BTC holdings needs to siphon funds for miners, they need to remove the 21M hard cap and use inflation as an alternative wealth tax, or the BTC market cap needs to fall in line with the security budget.

The goal was to showcase the process of developing an on-chain app from scratch using scaffold eth and tools like hard hat or Foundry. The demonstration included setting up a smart contract, building the front end, deploying the app to a network like Bas, and interacting with the deployed app. Additionally, the inline extensions, testing capabilities, and potential improvements with Foundry were also discussed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development process. The session also touched upon upcoming projects focusing on medium to hard content and learning resources like Speedrun Ethereum and the EthDev Tech Tree. Participants were encouraged to explore scaffold eth, engage with the build Guild community, and continue learning and building app functionalities using the provided resources and extensions.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How does the integration of tools like hard hat and Foundry enhance the development process of on-chain apps using scaffold eth, and what specific benefits do they bring to Ethereum developers?\n\n\n\n2.
