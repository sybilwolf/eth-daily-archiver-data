In reality, tokenomics (economics) is far, far more complex. Some of the smartest people in the world study and trade this stuff for a living and even <em>they</em> will admit that they don&#39;t know what will or will not be a good investment.</p>\n\n<p>Now of course there are <em>factors</em> that contribute to something being a good vs bad investment (supply, inflation, demand, etc) but at the end of the day we simply don&#39;t know. When you throw in the complexity of blockchains (burning mechanisms, release schedules, locking, staking, etc.) it complicates things <em>even more.</em> There are <em>countless</em> examples of this in crypto- of projects that checked off pretty much every box you&#39;d want...and yet they crashed and burned or have just slowly bled out against USD or BTC.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying ETH is a bad investment, but I think you need to carefully consider the bolded portion above when buying it (or any coin), and I think more people should consider, in my opinion, an area of investing that many crypto investors overlook because they&#39;re just so focused on things like scaling, TVL, etc: general psychology/beliefs/values/attitudes of the market and people.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, enough rambling.

He highlighted examples of unaccounted funds within government budgets, emphasizing the magnitude of financial discrepancies and their impact on global governance and economic stability. Jared also delved into the challenges of addressing illicit financial flows (IFFs) and the limitations of current anti-money laundering (AML) measures in combating financial crime effectively. He proposed a shift towards improving institutional frameworks and reducing transaction costs to unlock trillions of dollars in value and enhance governance worldwide.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n1. How can blockchain technology, particularly Ethereum, be leveraged to enhance transparency and accountability within financial systems to mitigate corruption and combat illicit financial flows (IFFs)?\n\n2. In what ways can the Ethereum community collaborate with regulatory bodies and institutions to develop innovative solutions that improve the effectiveness of anti-money laundering (AML) measures while reducing the cost of compliance for entities operating within the financial sector?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
