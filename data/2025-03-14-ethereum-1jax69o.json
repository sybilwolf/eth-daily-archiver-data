Just a reminder of the fundamentals that got me into this in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Since Satoshi published the whitepaper that laid out Bitcoin, there have really only been three truly original types of technologies launched.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin - Proved a decentralised cryptocurrency running on blockchain was possible.</li>\n<li>Ethereum -  Proved using a blockchain and cryptocurrency to run applications was possible.</li>\n<li>Tokens/Apps/Things built on either of the above.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The blockchain trilemma, a phrase first coined by Vitalik lays out that basically, the three difficult parts to achieve with a blockchain are security, scalability and decentralisation.  Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only blockchains that prioritise being in the most perfect place possible with current blockchain development.</p>\n\n<p>Everything else is just a copy of one these three types of cryptos and they all sacrifice one of those three core trilemma tenets to try to differentiate themselves. These things are important and at some point these other projects will probably get found out at some stage if they grow.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s the famous quote &quot;Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m happy holding my Eth, one day the markets will no longer be irrational, well at least to some extent but I&#39;m pretty sure the larger world will wake up to what is possible on Eth and why it matters to build things with either Bitcoin or Ethereum rather than the millions of copies.  </p>\n\n<p>I think we are seeing that already with the US and other governments looking at Bitcoin seriously.

DevCon #101:\n\n[Top Hacks since Devcon VI: what did we learn? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQjw2ffttzw)\n\nIt's Friday, March 14, 2025 \u2014 day 101 of our DevCon Ethducation listen-along series.\n\n##Summary:\n\nSo far at the Ethereum Developer Conference, discussions have covered various hacks and incidents related to Ethereum blockchain technologies. The workshops highlighted key hacks and vulnerabilities discovered since the previous DevCon, including issues like key compromises, Oracle manipulation, and smart contract vulnerabilities. In one instance, a significant security flaw in the ERC-20 standard was discussed, which led to financial losses for Ethereum users due to handling of transactions. The importance of thorough code auditing, enhancing security measures, educating users, and addressing these issues at the wallet level were emphasized. Additionally, panelists provided insights on the complexities of handling upgrades, secure key management practices, and user error prevention within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe speaker discussed a private key compromise and mentioned that the presentation shared will include more hacks and details. A question was asked about managing software updates for air gap machines used for signing. The speaker explained that for signing purposes, constant updates may not be necessary and that whitelist repositories and firewall settings can be used for updates without disconnecting the machine entirely from the internet. They also suggested using live CD style systems for secure transactions and emphasized the importance of minimizing continuous exposure to vulnerabilities. The session ended with the offer for further discussions outside the workshop and a recommendation for the next Workshop by the red Guild on avoiding phishing attacks.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How do incidents like the security flaw in the ERC-20 standard and key compromises impact the overall trust and adoption of Ethereum blockchain technologies, and how can the community collectively work towards mitigating such vulnerabilities?\n\n- In what ways can the blockchain community effectively balance the need for regular software updates to enhance security measures with the potential risks and complications associated with continuous exposure to vulnerabilities, especially in the context of secure key management practices and user error prevention?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments. The primary goal here is community development through education.\n\n- [Yesterday's discussion](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ja5dmp/daily_general_discussion_march_13_2025/mhjglb0/)\n- [All DevCon talks ranked by views](https://github.com/hanniabu/devcon-7-videos/blob/main/videos.md)\n- [The grand idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1h0xkvx/daily_general_discussion_november_27_2024/lz8b95w/)\n\n***\n^The ^summary ^and ^discussion ^questions ^are ^AI-generated ^from ^Youtube's ^autogenerated ^transcript. ^The ^transcript ^may ^capture ^some ^names ^and ^terms ^incorrectly.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><h1>Daily DevCon #101:</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQjw2ffttzw\">Top Hacks since Devcon VI: what did we learn? </a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s Friday, March 14, 2025 \u2014 day 101 of our DevCon Ethducation listen-along series.</p>\n\n<h2>Summary:</h2>\n\n<p>So far at the Ethereum Developer Conference, discussions have covered various hacks and incidents related to Ethereum blockchain technologies.
