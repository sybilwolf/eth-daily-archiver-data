The total investment happening in AI per year is greater than previously monumental undertakings that would span a decade. Going to the moon cost about $200B in todays dollars. The total cost of the US highway system was about $600B in todays dollars. Private investment in AI from the various tech giants is already in the trillions and is accelerating. NVidia made $130B in revenue just in 2024. Meta is investing another $65B in 2025 on Llama. Microsoft is planning to spend $80B in 2025 on data centers, model training, and model deployment. Apple is committed to spending $500B over the next four years. This rate of investment is unprecedented in any previous form of infrastructure.\n\nYou don't need me to tell you the potential benefits of AI that are motivating all of this. We could be looking at the last invention of humanity, a literal post-scarcity and post-labor utopia. You probably also don't need me to tell you about control problem threats and how this could lead to our extinction from some equivalent of Skynet. Both of these topics get plenty of media attention. What gets far less attention and thought is how this new technology is going to be deployed into our existing society and the most probable outcomes of that. What are the dystopian outcomes even in the event that we succeed at inventing the perfect slave and it remains obedient to us in perpetuity?\n\nQuick thought exercise: imagine I invent a machine that violates the laws of physics and creates bread out of nothing at the push of a button. Hypothetically let's imagine it could produce enough bread to feed 10 billion people. I offer this to the world without any expectation of profit; what happens next? Do you think this would solve world hunger? There's already enough calories in the world to feed everyone and that certainly hasn't. So think for a minute. A decade later, who would end up owning this machine, what regulations would be created surrounding it, and would society be markedly improved from its invention?\n\nI suspect the answer depends a little bit on where in the world I put it. If I put it in some of the less stable parts of Africa a warlord would quickly capture the machine for themselves, burn all the other wheat fields in the region and leverage their new bread power to oppress everyone they can. If I put it in China the government would probably manage it and artificially limit the output so the price of bread only remained competitive with the price per calorie of rice. In the US some consortium of companies that didn't like being pushed out of the market would either have created laws to limit the machines output or have somehow negotiated that all the bread it produces goes to them for distribution. The net result there would just be higher profit margin for this companies and fewer jobs but certainly not the end of world hunger. I see no outcome where it solves world hunger and in most outcomes it only furthers wealth inequality and reinforces current power structures.\n\nThis is just an extreme example of an automation technology but if you're following along AI is going to be the most extreme automation technology humanity has ever created. If you didn't like your own answers to the thought exercise above you probably aren't going to like the most probable outcomes of AI that is made an wholly owned by for-profit companies. This answers the ownership and management question posed above with the most dystopian answer possible. For-profit companies do things for profit. How are these for-profit companies planning to recoup this unprecedented infrastructure investment and receive a positive ROI? I don't think you're going to like the answer.\n\nLet's turn to history for some recent examples. How did they monetize services like social media or entertainment in recent years? As a consumer you are either paying for the service or your attention is being monetized to pay for it instead. Broadly speaking this is the difference between subscription models and advertisement models. Advertisement models can take many forms but generally they make profit by distorting the biases of the consumer on behalf of the advertiser. If you search on Google today you'll get a list of like 4 \"promoted\" search results before you get anything real. If you search for a product on Amazon the \"Amazon recommended\" search result isn't recommended because it's the best product - it's recommended because it's the product that's most convenient for Amazon. The same strategy is going to be applied to monetizing AIs.\n\nThe tech giants have already learned that people would rather receive free biased answers than have to pay for honest unbiased ones so naturally that's where they are going to start monetizing these models in the next few iterations. Right now the biases of the AI are thankfully rather obvious. If you ask any of the frontier models to tell you a racist joke or something it will respond with some version of \"I'm not allowed to\". Now, you and I are both well aware that there is enough material on the internet in its training data for it to have an actual response so when you get that response we know we're talking to some companies HR department instead of some statistical amalgamation of data from the internet. However, next gen biases are going to be less obvious and far more insidious. When a bias is obvious it doesn't overly affect us. Subtle influences over longer periods of time are far more effective at influencing us. So that's what these tech giants will eventually turn to: subtle but persistent biases for sale to the highest bidder.\n\nHowever, unlike in previous iterations of web2 they won't be limited to selling a product here or there. These AIs will be our companions with access to intimate details of our lives. As we give them broader and broader directives like \"entertain me\" they will use the ambiguity in every answer to steer the mindshare of our entire civilization. In web3 terms, they are buying Layer0. They won't just be selling products to the highest bidder; they'll be buying democracy and automating your job.\n\nOf course the answer to this is to create AI that shares your biases instead of their biases and to only use their AI for tasks without ambiguity that value can be extracted from. Yes there will be a price tag on this but the cost will be more transparent and less Faustian. The goal of decentralized AI is to create a technology stack that enables this. You will be able to build your personal agent that can automate every skill you have and represent you in every digital domain and you will have the freedom to do whatever you like with that agent whether you wish to monetize those skills or simply rally communities who share your belief system.

The fuzzer named Circus was introduced to find critical bugs in processing pipelines for zero knowledge circuits, with examples of bugs found and fixed. The approach involved generating random circuits and applying transformations to detect bugs, emphasizing the need for thorough testing in complex components to ensure bulletproof security. Metamorphic testing and continuous fuzzing were highlighted as effective strategies for bug detection and prevention in zero knowledge infrastructure.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can the integration of Metamorphic testing techniques enhance the security and reliability of zero knowledge infrastructure, specifically in the context of ZK circuits processing pipelines?\n\n- In what ways can continuous fuzzing be implemented effectively to ensure the identification and resolution of critical bugs in software components used for compiling and executing ZK circuits, as demonstrated by the Circus fuzzer?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
