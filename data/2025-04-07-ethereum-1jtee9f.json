It's the dry powder I only bring out when all indicators look completely FUBAR.

I think there's a decent chance we hit $2500 again relatively soon, even in 2025.

They emphasized the economic efficiencies and collaboration benefits of open source software. The talk covered different types of open source licenses such as business, copyleft, and permissive licenses like BSL, GPL, and Apache 2.0, highlighting the differences between them. Additionally, the speaker touched on ensuring legal protections for code, security practices, vulnerability disclosures, software build materials, software and artifact authentication, and building open communities with transparent governance models. They also discussed revenue strategies for financial sustainability in open source projects and the role of on-chain governance in the future. The audience engaged in a Q&A session, covering topics like governance transitions, open source software evolution in decentralized solutions, resources for governance model transitions, and public good funding in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can open source software projects strike a balance between encouraging community collaboration and ensuring financial sustainability through revenue strategies?\n\n- In what ways can on-chain governance play a pivotal role in shaping the future of open source projects, particularly in the context of decentralized solutions like Ethereum?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
