My understanding is that, yes, the Uniswap router will attempt to route through all available pools for a token pair, including ones with restrictive hooks \u2014 but if a pool has a hook that restricts access (e.g., only certain NFT holders can swap), and the user doesn&#39;t meet those conditions, the swap will fail for that pool. The router will then either revert the whole route or skip to another pool if fallback routing is enabled. Which is another amazing characteristic of V4 imo</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-14 07:21:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mn2ddxe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1jyrwki","parent_id":"t1_mn2bcej","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"Pools with hooks are whitelisted for the router, way too dangerous to auto include.

They emphasized the importance of open-source standards and identified various opportunities for improvement, such as asynchronous programming, session keys, and cross-chain token standards. The speaker outlined a user journey for a blockchain application and highlighted the significance of composability in Web3 development. They also described their vision for the future of Ethereum, including mass adoption and a user-owned internet. Throughout the talk, the speaker exhibited passion and energy, engaging the audience with their insights and suggestions for enhancing Ethereum technology.\n\n##Discussion Questions:\n\n- How can the Ethereum community work towards achieving seamless interoperability and addressing fragmentation within the blockchain ecosystem, and what role do open-source standards play in this process?\n\n- In what ways can asynchronous programming, session keys, and cross-chain token standards contribute to enhancing user experiences and fostering composability in Web3 development, as highlighted in the speaker's vision for the future of Ethereum?\n\nYour mission is to consume the content, then comment with insight on this thread, and vote up other valuable comments.
