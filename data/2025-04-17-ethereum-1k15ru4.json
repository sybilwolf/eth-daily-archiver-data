Ethereum continues to handle fewer, higher-value transactions with stability, even in a market-wide cooldown.\n\nEthereum is good. We make more fees than bitcoin.

Solana&#39;s economic activity dropped off sharply.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd04 Txs: Solana -33% | Ethereum -12% | Total -24%\n\u2192 Solana still leads in raw count. Ethereum is more stable.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>\ud83e\udde0 Final TL;DR \u2013 Ethereum vs. Solana</h2>\n\n<p>Ethereum continues to show economic resilience, with transfer volume down just 15% despite falling fees. It remains the most consistent platform for high-value, economically meaningful on-chain activity.</p>\n\n<p>Solana, while still generating far more raw transactions, saw both fee revenue (-87%) and transfer volume (-68%) collapse \u2014 revealing a growing disconnect between activity and actual value.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting:</p>\n\n<p>Around 15% of Solana\u2019s transactions are validator voting transactions</p>\n\n<p>Fees are not refunded on failed transactions, inflating usage stats</p>\n\n<p>This calls into question how much of Solana\u2019s throughput reflects true user demand</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line:\nSolana&#39;s numbers cabed in hard - it also has a high amount of low value transactions. Ethereum continues to handle fewer, higher-value transactions with stability, even in a market-wide cooldown.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum is good. We make more fees than bitcoin. L1 + L2 metrics combined shows that EVM is superior.\nThere is no alternative.</p>\n\n<p>If we really need to look for competition its bitcoin and tron judging by volume transfer. ...tron. \ud83e\udd26</p>\n\n<p>I mean both options suck for different reasons. We dont really have competition actually.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-17 11:27:07","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-04-17 12:24:09","id":"mnmn3et","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1k15ru4","parent_id":"t3_1k15ru4","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProstMelone","body":"Great writeup, we need more raw stats like these.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Great writeup, we need more raw stats like these.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-17 12:05:55","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mnmuuvh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1k15ru4","parent_id":"t1_mnmn3et","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KaiserMerkle","body":"I am working on automating this with an agent ideally.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I am working on automating this with an agent ideally.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-17 12:14:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mnmwm6z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1k15ru4","parent_id":"t1_mnmuuvh","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ProstMelone","body":"Sweet, the anti FUD bot or is this a different project?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sweet, the anti FUD bot or is this a different project?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-04-17 12:37:39","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mnn159h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1k15ru4","parent_id":"t1_mnmwm6z","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KaiserMerkle","body":"Nope, not involved in that project (very cool though) - but would be trivial for them to just make a request for that data.

This translates to less stuff for everyone and therefore less purchasing power for your money (inflation). The whole world is about to get a lot poorer. I see no way out of that at this point. What I do see are people substantially underestimating risk.</p>\n\n<p>That said, there are opportunities in every bear market. You just have to be patient and selective instead of greedy. Give it a couple quarters for the layoffs to hit in earnest. Worst case, hyperinflation on USD in 2 years and humanitarian failures (food, power, and medicine shortages) in years 3-4. Some companies will power through these hard times with automation and come out much stronger for it.
