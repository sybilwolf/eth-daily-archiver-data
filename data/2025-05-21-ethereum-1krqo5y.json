In my current understanding the plan is to publish a block on chain and then give the provers until the next slot to publish a proof. There might be some advantage to be a fully integrated builder and prover, but it probably is not a big advantage and therefore there might be enough room for an independent market to develop. I do not know about any discussion about remuneration and how it will work for prover nodes, but I could imagine they are getting paid when their proof is published on chain. As far as I remember the proving costs per block should be extremely low. I think on the order of cents.\n\nAt the moment there is already a zk prover market for all the different zk L1s and L2s. The market still is very immature, but it sounds like there is a lot of progress and different models are being tested. A recent zk podcast covers one of the approaches and the history a bit: https://zeroknowledge.fm/podcast/355/\n\nAs provers have almost no power over the network we will just need 1 of them to do their job for the chain to work normally. If they do not do their job and fail to publish proofs in time, your smartwatch is not able to verify it and trustlessly retrieve the chain state. Not good but also not chain breaking. Depending on how far things are pushed one might easily be able to rent a handful of old GPUs on one of the decentralized GPU market places and build proofs as well. Currently these markets are far far cheaper than anything a professional hyperscaler can provide. Sure you rent potatoes, but handful of the potatoes of the future might be enough to make proofs. If we push things to the absolute limit however, then only the most sophisticated entities can provide proofs which is a centralization risk.\n\nFor censorship resistance we need the block builders to follow certain rules. FOCIL is such a proposal which is being heavily discussed and will come in a year or two at the earliest.\n\nThere will be medium nodes in the network, which are similar to the current validators recomendations. My 2 year old NUC is able to validate 1k to 10k tps. Not too far away from still being able to validate a highly scaled and zk proven chain. In a few years with newer hardware and more optimizied clients I guess we could be able to validate the chain even without zk proofs. So, I am not too worried about this issue at the moment.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Block building and block proofing are two different jobs. In my current understanding the plan is to publish a block on chain and then give the provers until the next slot to publish a proof. There might be some advantage to be a fully integrated builder and prover, but it probably is not a big advantage and therefore there might be enough room for an independent market to develop. I do not know about any discussion about remuneration and how it will work for prover nodes, but I could imagine they are getting paid when their proof is published on chain. As far as I remember the proving costs per block should be extremely low. I think on the order of cents.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment there is already a zk prover market for all the different zk L1s and L2s. The market still is very immature, but it sounds like there is a lot of progress and different models are being tested. A recent zk podcast covers one of the approaches and the history a bit: <a href=\"https://zeroknowledge.fm/podcast/355/\">https://zeroknowledge.fm/podcast/355/</a></p>\n\n<p>As provers have almost no power over the network we will just need 1 of them to do their job for the chain to work normally. If they do not do their job and fail to publish proofs in time, your smartwatch is not able to verify it and trustlessly retrieve the chain state. Not good but also not chain breaking. Depending on how far things are pushed one might easily be able to rent a handful of old GPUs on one of the decentralized GPU market places and build proofs as well. Currently these markets are far far cheaper than anything a professional hyperscaler can provide. Sure you rent potatoes, but handful of the potatoes of the future might be enough to make proofs. If we push things to the absolute limit however, then only the most sophisticated entities can provide proofs which is a centralization risk.</p>\n\n<p>For censorship resistance we need the block builders to follow certain rules. FOCIL is such a proposal which is being heavily discussed and will come in a year or two at the earliest.</p>\n\n<p>There will be medium nodes in the network, which are similar to the current validators recomendations.
