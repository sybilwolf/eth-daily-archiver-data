It looked hairy at some points but tornado cash transactions always ended up on chain with around a delay of maybe 30-40s instead of the 12 seconds (or actually ~6s) one would expect on average. This was definitely not perfect, but Ethereum handled it pretty well considering the power of the US government imposing these sanctions. In the end, the battle was won in court, but Ethereum has shown it is pretty resistant even against censorship attempts from the largest powers in the world.\n\nIf you look at censorship.pics (by Tony Wahrst\u00e4tter) today there is almost no censorship anymore. It looks like at the end of March all relays decided to include tornado cash transactions again. The block builders followed this as well. This was around the time the U.S. Department of the Treasury made a press release to remove the Tornado cash contracts from the OFAC sanctions list. The battle around the tornado cash sanctions is officially behind us now. There will be other attempts by governments around the world to censor transactions from and to entities they do not like. We just got some room to breathe now. Having a good censorship resistant chain still has to be the goal. And there is work being done to achieve this. Maybe the upgrade after Fusaka will get a first implementation.\n\nCensorship is not the only issue there is in the block building process though. In the last few months it has become more and more obvious that private order flows are dominating the market. This means if you submit a transaction, your transaction does not directly go to the Ethereum network, but it first goes to a block builder which then builds a block with it, which then gets proposed. I would guess the wallets and RPC providers have special deals with block builders and get paid a small part of the block rewards to provide this order flow. For the user it is also an improvement because depending on the exact contracts between the wallet provider (or RPC) and the block builder the user might be safe from the most toxic MEV extraction methods like sandwiching. For the Ethereum network as a whole however it is an additional centralizing force, as there is no way for smaller block builders to have access to this order flow and therefore no way to become competitive in the space. The established actors can keep their position just because there is no way for other actors to enter it. \n\nHere comes BuilderNet by flashbots. They are trying to decentralize block building again by getting rid of many of the sources of trust that were needed in the private order flow model. Instead of running everything on normal CPUs they use so called Trusted Execution Environmnents (TEE), which most high end CPUs have, to run some of the code. This ensures that all the participants follow the rules without having to sign contracts with each individual participant. All the rules are written in the code. This allows many more participants to take part in the block building process. At the moment, Beaverbuild, Flashbots builder and Nethermind are the largest participant in BuilderNet. According to mevboost.pics (again by Tony Wahrst\u00e4tter) they already build around 10% of the blocks on Ethereum. Not sure how much of the order flow they receive, but seeing that they are building 10% of the blocks means that they have access to at least a very competitive size of the order flow market. As far as I understand beaverbuild is still transitioning to BuilderNet, so the BuilderNet share is expected to grow further. Lets hope there will be a more flourishing ecosystem of block builders to counter the centralization we have seen in the last 2.5 years.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Censorship resistance was a big topic in the last few years with the tornado cash sanctions and the ever more centralizing block builder market.

The sentence you quoted took me some time to write, as there is pretty much no way to boil it down in a way I thought was good. That you picked this one out makes it obvious I should have rewritten it a few more times. The example you brought up is also not something I would call censorship. Censorship normally is defined as preventing speech, communication or information. I guess financial censorship would fall in the communication/information part of it, but stretches the definition a bit already. Financial censorship is also sometimes used as an way to indirectly censor groups or companies, see for example the case of wikileaks 15 years ago.\n\nI think more generally the way one looks at censorship goes back to some core beliefs one has about the society one wants to live in. Similar discussions were had when the internet got more and more public attention in the mid 90ies. For many people it was a horrifying thought that 'bad' people could publish whatever they wanted and there is very little one can do about it. The internet was relatively permissionless back then and that gave rise to new ideas and also new issues. Some companies like compuserve and AOL tried another approach and built a closed off, curated 'internet'. Within a short period of time it became obvious that these curated 'internets' will not survive very long as they did not only prevent bad people publishing bad things but also prevented innovation and therefore the curated 'internet' was just boring and all the action happened on the permissionless one. There is obviously a lot more nuance to that as the regulations in the USA also pushed providers to a more hands-off approach.\n\nI see the Ethereum base layer in a similar way. Without neutrality and permissionlessness we will not have built a system where interesting things can be built on top. Censorship resistance is a property necessary to be a neutral and permissionless system. If censorship is possible on the base layer someone will have to have the keys to impose this censorship. Might be the good guys of today will turn into the bad guys of tomorrow and we just handed them the keys. This does not mean that everything built on Ethereum needs to be censorship resistant. Every project can design it in whatever way they want and people can choose to participate or not. But if the base layer is censorable already there is no possibility to build anything permissionless or neutral on top of it anymore. Or in other words you are limited already by the base layer. This still means that people committing crime will go to jail and depending on what they did, they most probably should.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I agree with you that censorship is a more complex topic than I gave it space here.

For many people it was a horrifying thought that &#39;bad&#39; people could publish whatever they wanted and there is very little one can do about it. The internet was relatively permissionless back then and that gave rise to new ideas and also new issues. Some companies like compuserve and AOL tried another approach and built a closed off, curated &#39;internet&#39;. Within a short period of time it became obvious that these curated &#39;internets&#39; will not survive very long as they did not only prevent bad people publishing bad things but also prevented innovation and therefore the curated &#39;internet&#39; was just boring and all the action happened on the permissionless one. There is obviously a lot more nuance to that as the regulations in the USA also pushed providers to a more hands-off approach.</p>\n\n<p>I see the Ethereum base layer in a similar way. Without neutrality and permissionlessness we will not have built a system where interesting things can be built on top. Censorship resistance is a property necessary to be a neutral and permissionless system. If censorship is possible on the base layer someone will have to have the keys to impose this censorship. Might be the good guys of today will turn into the bad guys of tomorrow and we just handed them the keys. This does not mean that everything built on Ethereum needs to be censorship resistant. Every project can design it in whatever way they want and people can choose to participate or not. But if the base layer is censorable already there is no possibility to build anything permissionless or neutral on top of it anymore. Or in other words you are limited already by the base layer. This still means that people committing crime will go to jail and depending on what they did, they most probably should.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-05-23 17:44:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mtvfs8x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ktcbmc","parent_id":"t1_mtum6j1","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/timmerwb","body":"Sure, I don't disagree with your views - perhaps it was just unfortunate language.

The whole idea that Ethereum\u2019s value must come from how often it's *used* seems completely irrelevant to me. Bitcoin is valuable because people believe it will go up in price. That was my assumption with ETH too - and for a while, it worked.\n\nSure, there were rough patches - like when it crashed to $80 in 2018\u20132019 - but by 2021, ETH had recovered, and many still saw it as a legitimate store of value.\n\nBut over the past few years, something shifted. For some reason, ETH got kicked out of the \u201cstore of value\u201d box and shoved into the \u201cutility\u201d box, where it suddenly had to justify its worth through complex metrics: transaction volume, gas fees, developer activity, network upgrades, and comparisons with newer chains.\n\nThat was never the deal. The thesis was simple: buy ETH, hold it, and let it appreciate - possibly even outperform BTC. If Bitcoin outperformed ETH by 10%, fine. But a 250% outperformance since the Merge?

For some reason, ETH got kicked out of the \u201cstore of value\u201d box and shoved into the \u201cutility\u201d box, where it suddenly had to justify its worth through complex metrics: transaction volume, gas fees, developer activity, network upgrades, and comparisons with newer chains.</p>\n\n<p>That was never the deal.
