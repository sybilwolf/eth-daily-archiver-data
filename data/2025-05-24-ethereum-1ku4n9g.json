The co-founder of Ethereum has liquidated, is it time to escape the peak? What exactly happened? Let's first talk about the shocking news regarding Ethereum. Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey transferred $260 million worth of ETH to the exchange, essentially selling all his positions, and calling it a run is not an exaggeration. Moreover, the impact of this event goes far beyond that, as he, being a co-founder of Ethereum, is definitely an insider, and he himself is a master of selling at the peak. The last time he sold ETH was 6 months ago when Ethereum was $3,700, selling 20,000. The time before that was a year ago, in March last year, when ETH was $3,800, and he transferred 10,000 to sell at exchange K, each time selling close to the peak position. Now this insider and peak-selling master has transferred all his coins to the exchange, directly liquidating. What does this mean? I think everyone already has the answer in their hearts. So if you hold ETH, you really need to be extra careful; if there's a high point, consider taking some profits. I estimate that the current price of $2,700 is about right, or it might go up another 10% to close to $3,000. It depends on whether you want to greedily chase a little tail. Additionally, I wonder if everyone has noticed that there is a very magical rule in our cryptocurrency circle: that is, when the price of a coin doubles, it often indicates that the peak is approaching or a major correction is imminent, and Ethereum has triggered this rule.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Is this real and how come it didn&#39;t affect the price yet if it is?</p>\n\n<p>Bad news, everyone.
