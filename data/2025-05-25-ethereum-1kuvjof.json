It's second only to BTC in terms of SOV credibility, and it's up over 210,000% since launch. No other crypto asset besides BTC comes close to that performance or resilience.\n\nJust as Bitcoin is the original (OG) blockchain, Ethereum is the OG smart contract platform - the foundation on which the modern decentralized ecosystem was built. Yet despite its legacy status, ETH continues to evolve and arguably has stronger fundamentals than BTC.\n\nFrom a security standpoint, Ethereum's economic model makes it more resistant to a 51% attack than Bitcoin. Its tokenomics are solid, and before the Pectra upgrade, ETH's inflation rate was lower than BTC\u2019s - though I\u2019m not sure where it stands post-Pectra. It has the potential to become deflationary again.\n\nSo why are people trying to lump ETH in with newer high inflation chains like Solana, Sui, etc., as if it has to constantly prove itself? These other chains are often more centralized and less battle-tested.
