If you go up to 150 million I am currently of the opinion that this should only be done once we have ePBS because of the bandwidth constraints some nodes have. As we will most probably also decrease slot times in the future, which in effect increases the throughput without increasing the gas limits, it is unwise to push the gas limit to their absolute limits now which would make it necessary to reduce them again later on. And yes I am signalling for 60 million since the Pectra upgrade. </p>\n\n<p>I wrote a much longer piece a few months ago, most should still be valid: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ikhihv/daily_general_discussion_february_08_2025/mbn7z7b/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ikhihv/daily_general_discussion_february_08_2025/mbn7z7b/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-05-26 07:27:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mub0ya9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1kvn3n3","parent_id":"t1_muas5wo","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Inevitablechained","body":"Wow, thanks!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Wow, thanks!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-05-26 07:40:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mub29sq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1kvn3n3","parent_id":"t1_mub0ya9","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/pa7x1","body":"A quick rationale for why 60M is likely safe now, while higher is a bit more untested.\n\nWith Pectra we introduced a repricing of calldata gas cost.
