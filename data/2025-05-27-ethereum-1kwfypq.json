great blog post was published today](https://ethpandaops.io/posts/60m-gas-sepolia-hoodi/) by the EF DevOps team (ethPandaOps) that analyses the impact of recent gas limit increases (to 60M) on the Sepolia and Hoodi testnets.\n\nIt's well worth a read for anyone that runs validators or is interested in seeing the L1 scale through gas limit increases ( like u/Weitarded and about 150k validators on Ethereum currently signaling for a 60M gas limit ).\n\nThis is exactly the kind of analysis that imo should be included in each and every post calling for higher gas limits, instead of almost blindly calling for a higher number. We already have 15% of the network signaling for 60M on mainnet, and we don't even have a rough idea of how safe that is yet...\n\nNotably:\n\n> There is a large difference between the two networks on both metrics.

We can't push the gas limit into the sky just because we can _execute_ large blocks quickly enough. Apart from the issues surrounding state growth, we also need to account for worst-case blocks that are specifically constructed by an attacker to take as long as possible to execute, a sort of DoS attack.\n\nTo wrap up, here's the conclusion from the team:\n\n> Based on the data from Hoodi & Sepolia, 60M is safe as far as block/blob propagation is concerned. It's very important to note that these testnets are not representative of Mainnet. We'll be conducting additional analysis on Mainnet in the coming days, but for now we can say that 60M is possible on a fundamental level.\n\nSidenote: this may sound like I'm personally strongly against a gas limit increase, but that's not the case.

Thanks for doing this. As mentioned in my other post I am a bit skeptical around the statement \"This may indicate a sensitivity to large execution state size.\" It is not that I think the statement is wrong, but I think the data is not really conclusive in that case. My point being there are at the moment a lot of other possible explanations. I could for example imagine that the Sepolia validator nodes are much less beefy ones than the Hoodi validator nodes. Let me explain: there are only around 1700 validators on Sepolia, which means the client teams only run around 100 validators on their machines. This is different on Hoodi where each team has around 25k validators. This means they most probably have very different machines running Hoodi than Sepolia, because the Hoodi nodes get bombarded with 25k validators compared to just 100 validators for the Sepolia nodes. This difference then also shows in the execution speed of blocks. \n\nDid you also take a look at Holesky. Holesky should be closer to Sepolia in terms of state size, but still have a 'node beefyness' closer to Hoodi, because the different teams run 10k-100k validators. So, doing the analysis on Holesky could be an important datapoint to decide if it could be state size or if it is something else.\n\nOverall, the influence a large state size has on the execution time, should be easily measurable. Not easily in the sense that I could do it within a few minutes, but easily in the sense that one only has to look at a single node and not at the whole network to decide if it is an issue or not.\n\nThanks again for analyzing and writing the report.

Thanks for posting it. As far as I understand it, there is no issue to be expected from propagating larger (60M) blocks in the network, but there probably is some additional discussion needed around the state growth with the larger blocks. By looking at my own machine, this to me does not seem like an issue at the moment. A too large state would show itself in a slower execution time of the blocks. On my NUC13 i5, most of the blocks get executed within 20-200ms. Over the last 24 hours (7200 slots) there has been 1 block which took more than 1 second to execute and around 30 blocks where it took more than 0.4s. I have not checked if these handful of blocks accessed a lot of state or if they are just computationally intensive for other reasons. This means for more than 99% of the blocks my machine has more than a factor of 10 headroom. As far as I see it, there is very little indication that we currently have an issue with state growth. However, the problem with state growth is that it shows up only slowly over time and if you run into issues it is already too late as you can not easily shrink the state anymore and the larger the blocks, the faster we run towards this potential barrier. Now, that the stateless Ethereum roadmap item is being redesigned after verkle trees have been scrapped, we also do not have a clear way to solve a large state in the foreseeable future. This means it makes sense to be on the safer side here and make sure that we do not overload the nodes with state growth a few years down the line.\n\nI also have to say, that purely from the data, I am not convinced that the difference in Sepolia and Hoodi regarding the \"New Head Metric\" is a clear indication that the state size is the differnce. But I will try to formulate it a bit more clearly and ask samcm directly.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What a great read. Thanks for posting it.
