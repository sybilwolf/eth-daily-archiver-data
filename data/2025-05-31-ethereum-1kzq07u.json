And even in such highly unlikely case he would be able to steal only 100 USDC per day. Use the recovery code to reassign signing rights.\n2. **What if my Trezor gets stolen or lost?** The same reasoning for the phone applies. Use the recovery code to reassign signing rights.\n3. **What if my recovery code gets stolen or lost?** An attacker would still need the decryption password to access it. Should he somehow have it, he'd still have to wait for 1 month to take control of the account, during which you'd get notified on the Safe Wallet app and be able to cancel the attempt. Use your phone and the Trezor to replace the recovery code.\n4. **What if I am threatened with a 5$ wrench to hand everything over?** Pretend the Trezor is broken and give the attacker the wipe code. Using that will make the device effectively unusable. From that moment the only option the attacker has is to use your recovery code and wait for one month. Hopefully you get rescued in that time.\n\n**A couple of features I wish Safe had to make this even better:**  \n\\- The ability to block spending immediately without delay using the recovery code. This would allow to immediately block the attacker from accessing your 100 USDC daily allowance in the worst case of scenario #1.  \n\\- The ability to replace the recovery code with social recovery, similarly to Argent's guardians concept.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all!</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago I wrote some considerations about how to achieve a convenient yet safe self-custodial setup.
