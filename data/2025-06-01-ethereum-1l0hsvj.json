If you only \"sell\" the ETH after 1 year, the potential gains on that is tax free. The yield you made from DeFi is taxable income either way, valued in Euro at the time of receiving it, i.e. when you claim it.\n\nBut of course it gets muddy with this because if you put your 1 ETH \"into DeFi\", you're technically trading 1 ETH for some 1.238 xDebtETH token, and depending how you look at it, that could be considered a sale. I personally believe that perspective is insane for multiple reasons, so I'm not going to treat or declare it like this. That this is all gray area and unmanageable is what sucks so much though.\n\n>If you swapped 0.05 BTC for ETH, do you have to hold that ETH for another year?\n\nYes.
