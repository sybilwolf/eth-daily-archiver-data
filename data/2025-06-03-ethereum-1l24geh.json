Similar is the Ipsilon team. Only 2 of the 7 people stay at the Ethereum Foundation. The ipsilon team did the implementation and analysis of everything related to the EVM. I guess after the whole EOF debacle things had to be reorganized. Also the two programming language specific teams (Javascript and Python) have been disbanded.
