There are many challenges here.

Where does the money come from?\n\nIf you try to tax it from corporations and billionaires I expect they'll just incorporate in a different jurisdiction. You're playing a [race to the bottom](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/molochs-toolbox) game between various governments around the world for who is willing to give those billionaires the most favorable treatment to live there. Any form of wealth tax on digital wealth (most things except property tax) can escape the tax jurisdiction. Also good luck jailing an AI agent or corporation for not being in compliance with your tax laws. Blockchains only exacerbate this problem because judicial orders can't be enforced on addresses like they can be on bank accounts. Laws only hold people accountable, systems that function independent of people lack an enforcement point for laws.\n\nPrinting the money isn't viable at this scale either when everyone can just store their value in something that isn't robbing them. A long running thesis of mine is that blockchains are removing the friction of converting between different denominations of value. A combination of tokenized securities, decentralized exchanges, and fiat offramps will enable you to \"spend\" MSFT shares at point of sale to buy a sandwich. The buyer won't need to hold hyperinflationary fiat. Even the receiving business doesn't need to hold their cashflow in fiat  as long as they carve off the sales tax before converting it into the store of asset value of their choice. So what's left?\n\nThe most sustainable implementation I've read about bypasses the existing monetary system entirely. Rather than give people money to spend you create automation at a common good level (excludible, non-rivalrous) that grants each person a non-alienable claim to a pro-rata share of the output. Everyone can claim their ration of bread. However, as soon as you give people choice in what goods to claim you're going to end up creating a market with some new type of [FoodCoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xzINLykprA&ab_channel=WendoverProductions) to balance supply and demand on each commodity. This is basically a new money that only has claim on automation rather than human labor. Of course even proposing this system begs the question of how do you build it in the first place. It's like saying we could solve world hunger if someone gave us the magic bread making machine from the thought exercise above. I'm open minded to new ideas but I haven't come across anything I deem sustainable yet.\n\nThe internet's favorite take increasingly seems to be burn it all down and start the monetary system from zero. I don't know if a revolution is actually viable in a world where AI can deduce the thought leaders and then the police just disappear them as terrorists. Modern technology has increased the number of people that can be suppressed by a single compliant individual by a few orders of magnitude since the last time wealth inequality reached this level and the guillotines reset everything. I doubt it will play out this way but if it does it isn't going to play out like the romanticized ideas of the collapse community.\n\nAlso, controversial take: I'm not actually a fan of a pure UBI future. Even in the unlikely case where we could politically align on both a direction and implementation *and implement it* without corruption, coordination failures, or eventual corporate capture I still think it dangerously disregards human psychology and incentive alignment. Amongst the best possible outcomes of this route is some distant Wall-E/Brave New World style future where our lives consist of empty pleasures all day, we lose our capacity for critical thinking, and either populate until we reach the resource limits of whatever section of space we have access to or go extinct because we have no drive to expand at all.\n\nThe sole source of hope I'll give you in this direction is that there's nothing in the rules of physics which says that we should be able to make so much more with so much less work and that we should be poorer for it at the median. Rome was able to offer the daily bread to citizens 2000 years ago when the productivity per farmer wasn't 1/100th of what it is today. One out of two people in the US used to be farmers; now it's less than 1%. The world doesn't have an energy, housing, or food shortage. Humanity has a giving-a-shit shortage, especially amongst those with all the power. We have a global empathy shortage and mass coordination failure that perpetuates extraordinary amounts of unnecessary suffering.

Is there a positive role for humanity in a future where AI has access to orders of magnitude more computation than the sum of human intellect and can communicate at speeds quadrillions of times faster than people?\n\nClearly our best future needs to be a world of relative abundance. Humanity isn't virtuous in the face of shortages, perceived or real. Other than that the prevailing wisdom from a few thousands of years of philosophy is that humans are happy when our needs are met, we are part of a loving community, and when we are intrinsically motivated to work by the goal we are working towards rather than just for survival. The most inspiring goals are those that are larger than ourselves and so we are happiest when we are swept up into grander purposes than ourselves and devote our lives to them. Humanity isn't at its best living a hedonistic paradise. We're at our best when we're coordinating in pursuit of our nobler values. Basically, I want full employment for humanity.\n\nAccomplishing this requires 3 things:\n\n1) A resource distribution system that enables people to work towards these goals without having to otherwise worry lower tiers of the hierarchy of needs. All the bootstrap problems of UBI are still true here.\n\n2) An information system where people can discover causes they believe in.\n\n3) A coordination system that provides people the means to contribute to those causes and ensures that the output of everyone can be combined.\n\nThe difference between a UBI and full employment outcome depends on whether someone has to offer value to justify a share to the rivalrous resources our universe has to offer us. If the answer is no, the endgame is UBI. If the answer is yes, the endgame is either that capital is the last thing of value any human can offer (late stage capitalism) or that we find limitless demand for human contributions (full employment).\n\nAssuming you follow this line of reasoning, in addition to solving all the challenges of UBI we have to find a credible answer to work that around 10 billion people can contribute to that AIs can't just do better or that we choose to let humans do anyway. So, what are the characteristics of ideal occupations for full employment? Are there any jobs that can scale to 10 billion people while offering something of at least nominal value?\n\n1) The work shouldn't require too many resources. Not everyone can be literally building and launching rocket ships because we don't have enough energy and materials for that but learning is entirely informatic and scaling this to billions of people is something we can do with the technology of today.\n\n2) The job should be done with little coordination. It should have characteristics of [Stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy) or [Swarm Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence) so the majority of the effort is being put into useful outcomes rather than coordination. I'd also settle for an AI overlord for coordination in this regard.\n\n3) The work should be infinite. Anything that scales to 10 billion contributors probably scales to a trillion.\n\n4) The work should be valuable. Work that is meaningless will be perceived as meaningless which defeats the point of full employment as a goal. \n\nWhat jobs fit these criteria? Here are a few.\n\nFirst, we could create perpetual students. Learning requires little more than tools for information retrieval which we can easily scale to 10 billion people. Learning requires very little coordination and much of it is self-directed. As the brain learns it also tries to integrate the new knowledge into the existing knowledge which serendipitously creates novel outcomes. Finally there are essentially infinite combinations of topics each person can learn different subsets of. This process leads to novel discoveries which push the frontier to our species knowledge. \n\nThe second is governance. You decentralize decision making when it is worth trading execution efficiency for resilience. Representing multiple perspectives decreases the chance of failure from something being overlooked or from corruption. People hate governments for how slow and bureaucratic they are but many of those pain points are due to the architecture of the governance system rather than a side effect of balancing diverse perspectives in decision making. I'm not suggesting that everyone will have a full time job as a senator deciding planet scale matters all day every day. More likely, we will create digital twins of ourselves that represent our perspectives and we will let our personal AIs represent those perspectives in governance decisions and then justify their votes to us. This way we use AI to scale our perspectives and scale governance participation well beyond it's usual limits. For good or ill what will be remain is a global mindshare competition for the most memetic ideas. Maybe the most negative of those ideas can be managed in a technocratic way.\n\nFinally there is dispute resolution. There are several attack vectors that apply to AI that can't (yet) be applied to humans when humans are serving as a mediator or judge. For example, in the case of an AI, the AI can be copied and fed unlimited variations on an input to try to manipulate its output. Practically this means that an AI can't really be impartial as long as it can be copied by an attacker. A prosecutor with access to the AI model can run millions of permutations of attacks until your guilt is assured. With a person, you only get one try and the uncertainty forces an attacker to at least maintain plausible deniability. If you want to bribe a police officer out of a ticket you can't dial in the exact bribe amount and you want to use language that doesn't constitute a bribe offer beyond a shadow of a doubt. Worse yet is if the weights themselves can be manipulated by an owner. In that case, the owner and whomever they wish to protect are entirely above the law. The owner just has to ask the judge \"[would you kindly](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/would-you-kindly) dismiss this case\" and the AI slave will obey. From a game theory perspective uncertainty constrains dishonest behavior. When dealing with an AI you can remove all of this uncertainty and exploit corruption to the fullest degree. As an aside courtroom decisions are something you could manage with a governance framework so these may not be two different jobs.\n\nSo what are you doing in this AI endgame in your day to day? You are educating yourself, developing your expertise to gain governance weight, training your AI digital twin with your perspective so it can scale out representing you in every relevant decision impacted by those thoughts, and reviewing its decisions to hold it accountable. Together we can ensure we make the best decisions possible to create a world consistent with our values. You will be engaged and hopefully get to watch as our species collaborates with AI to create inspiring things.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hypothetically, what is the optimal world we want to live in and does it include AI at all?

The observation that these things can perform useful labor is a trillion dollar idea, but probably not a $10 trillion dollar idea. By this, I mean that I think that it will prove to be a huge boon for small business and catalyze a huge amount of innovation by unloading intern-level labor barriers to startups. But AI is not actually human, doesn't think like a person does, performs best when it can be fed a ton of relevant training data, and performs poorly when dealing with cutting edge problems where there is little to zero available training material. Consult Youtuber Internet of Bugs for a more informed opinion on this.\n\nSo the effect AI will have is to push human discussion to the cutting edge. In so many words, **after people internalize that LLMs are not on track to reach singularity, human discussion will naturally crash out of the broader internet and precipitate into micro-communities, which will naturally lean into becoming think-tanks.**\n\nThis is entirely why I am so preoccupied with creating the next generation of internet forums. The cutting edge discussion which these communities will produce naturally is insanely high value, so I am trying to redesign community monetization to focus on selling governance (and by proxy social standing) rather than advertisement, and to redesign the forum format to favor more complex discussion.\n\nAs to UBI: I don't think that anyone who favors UBI policies understands the human factors involved in poverty. I don't know everything, but I am active in my community with helping less fortunate or mentally ill people. While some people can be knocked into poverty by life handing them disasters, it's sustained by poor impulse control leading to poor money skills. You can often address acute needs with a one-time gift, but unless you treat the root cause--the lack of self-control--recurring gifts will tend to get squandered on unnecessary purchases, and ultimately wasted.\n\nUBI is not actually an effective way to lift people out of poverty because UBI proponents tend to have an oversimplified or rose-tinted perspective on poverty.   A person who is trapped in poverty has a life like a car which is both running out of gas and the engine block is on fire at the same time. Just adding money is like pouring gasoline on top of the flaming engine block; sure, that IS the stuff which should make the car go, but you're only going to make the flames bigger and turn what's already a permanent disaster into permanent damage.

Then you can carefully fill the tank with gas.</p>\n\n<p>This is obvious when you talk cars, but for some reason when we start talking about people, this becomes less obvious.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-06 02:20:00","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mw8x8ob","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1l2y43t","parent_id":"t1_mw1552z","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Equal-Jellyfish1","body":"Ethereum","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-04 06:11:01","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mvwnkyz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1l2y43t","parent_id":"t3_1l2y43t","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TimbukNine","body":"$2623","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$2623</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-04 06:23:17","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mvwoy5l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1l2y43t","parent_id":"t1_mvwnkyz","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/FrenktheTank","body":"0.0249","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>0.0249</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-04 06:35:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mvwq8tk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1l2y43t","parent_id":"t1_mvwoy5l","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Childsp","body":"Well gentlemoons and etherladies I'm officially on 3 week vacation in Ireland.
