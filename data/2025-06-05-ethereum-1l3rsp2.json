Lol, what an experience. Congrats on going through with it. Seriously, you put in motion a set of events that no one could have conceived of. What happens next? We don't know. But you innovated.\n\nIn coding (as you probably know), a very necessary part of the testing process (in most cases) is to make the code do stuff it wasn't supposed to. What happens? Does it break? Does it break *predictably*? Or does something totally unexpected happen? This is also rather like scientific method. This is how we \"make progress\".\n\nThe vast majority of people remain in their little comfort bubbles their whole lives, too scared to explore and take risks---to \"live\". Whatever else, don't dwell on the \"failures\" of this experience (if even their can be said to be any). It's just an experimental step. Hopefully it will guide and inspire you to do something else novel, and who knows what effect it might have elsewhere.
