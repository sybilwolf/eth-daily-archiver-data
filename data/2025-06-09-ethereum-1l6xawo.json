The proposal suggests a modular compliance strategy, leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies to manage personal data effectively while preserving decentralization. Key elements include pushing personal data to wallets and decentralized applications (DApps), using offchain storage with metadata-erasure, and splitting roles cryptographically. It also proposes integrating technologies like proto-danksharding (EIP-4844), zk-SNARKs, Fully Homomorphic Encryption, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), multiparty computation (MPC), Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), and Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS).<br/></li>\n<li>Virtuals Protocol announced via an <a href=\"https://x.com/virtuals_io/status/1932087678578921644\">X post</a> that &quot;The Future of AI agents.
