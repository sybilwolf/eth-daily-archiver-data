Back then, general purpose rollups did not exist. OP mainnet started in a limited fashion only 7 Months later and Arbitrum over a year later. Polygon brought high throughput (peak was 170 tps over a day) and cheap transactions to the Ethereum ecosystem (term used very losely here). The Polygon team bought crypto media figures left and right and brought them on as advisors. The polygon team stretched definitions and tried to convince people that they are an L2 and not a sidechain. They got criticized heavily for it, rightly so. The reality however was that if your dapp was not a high value dapp, you could not really deploy on Ethereum mainnet because of the high transaction fees. Sure, there were other sidechains, but polygon with their business development team managed to bring so many major Ethereum projects to their chain. If you wanted composability and cheap fees, you had to be on polygon. That is why in 2021/2022 it was the place to be for many lower value dapps. I also deployed quite a few contracts on there. Rollups were still painfull to use, unreliable and more expensive. The plan of Polygon was to migrate the POS chain to a zk rollup once the tech was ready. They bought the Hermes team to build it for them. \n\nOver the coming two years. Rollups matured and various zkRollups were released (Starknet, ZKsync, linea, scroll, ...). Unfortunately, none of the zkEVMs got massive traction. Zksync seems to be doing better than others though and Linea has at least the backing of Consensys. Polygons own zkEVM has been trailing behind the other zk rollups and it did not seem to catch up by any metric, even though the UX got better. Optimistic rollups also stole the mindshare away from Polygon POS. In addition, zk rollups seem to struggle to find product market fit, even though they are more secure than optimistic rollups and improve on some UX issues optimistic rollups have. I guess at the moment, the most reasonable path forward for zkrollup teams is probably to try and become the stack onto which native rollups are built upon or later on even the snarkified mainnet. Not sure how big the chances are for each team is to reach this goal though. So, I would guess the Polygon team did not find a good way to finish their zkEVM and migrate their chain to their zk stack. So they had to salvage what is possible and now try to find a way forward with their POS chain. \n\nAt the moment Polygon POS does about 2.5 times the transactions Ethereum mainnet does. Not really spectacular considering the scaling goals we have with mainnet. Polygon will be a slower, more centralized sidechain without interoperability. Centralized high throughput chains are also a dime a dozen and the Polygon POS stack is just massively outdated. Not really a good way to convince people to develop on it.
