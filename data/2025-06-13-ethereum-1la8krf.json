The interviewer (Friederike Ernst) wants to go very deep with technical questions, but Joaquin cannot really answer all of them, but it is great to hear them talk about some of the trade offs in detail. It is seldom that people from projects talk so openly about the compromises they had to make and the plans to fix them in the future. In many other podcasts these discussion are nothing more than shillfests for the project. Not really helpful if you want to learn anything. \n\nWhat I learned:\n\nTaiko brands itself as a zk rollup. At the moment they are not. They use the provers from Risc0 and Succinct to prove the validity of the chain. This is great as they do not rely on a single zk implementation which could lead to a catastrophic failure if a bug in one specific implementation is exploited. But according to Joaquin about 80% of the blocks are proven using TEEs (trusted execution environment) and not zero knowledge proofs. This adds additional trust assumptions. This is mostly done for historical reasons as zk proofing has only recently become performant enough to be used for all blocks. They are increasing the fraction of zk proven blocks, but it seems to take some time. \n\nBased rollups have the advantage that there is no central sequencer, but this leads to issues for the user experience. Transactions are only included once the blobs land on Ethereum mainnet. This will happen at most every 12 seconds. If there aren't enough transactions in between blobs, these blobs will only be partially full. Partially full blobs cost more to publish than they give to the builder and proposer. This leads to a loss for everyone involved. To have full blobs Taiko would have to wait over a minute in between publishing blobs. That would be a user experience on the level of Bitcoin. That is why their own block builder subsidizes blobs to have a blob every 36 seconds or so. Not a great user experience, but also not a really horrible one. Preconfirmations will help in improving that massively, as they will allow a trustless confirmation of inclusion before a blob has been published. This means time between blobs can be longer, until they are full, without impacting the user experience.\n\nIn the podcast they talk about how they want to have preconfirmations ready soon. The podcast is a month old. Preconfirmations are now a reality on their testnet. I just tested it and it takes 2 seconds to confirm that my transaction has been included. The lag still is clearly noticeable compared to other rollups with centralized sequencers, but it is a massive improvement already. I do not know if they plan to reduce the preconfirmation time further. They expect to release preconfirmation on Taiko mainnet in 1-2 months. Pretty exciting.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Finally, I had the time to listen to the epicenter podcast with Joaquin Mendes, the COO of Taiko: <a href=\"https://epicenter.tv/episodes/597\">https://epicenter.tv/episodes/597</a></p>\n\n<p>They go quite deep into the details of how Taiko is built, what tradeoffs it has and what will be done in the coming months.

Again - don&#39;t chastise lol, I&#39;m probably asking dumb shit and just don&#39;t fully understand it. But... if that&#39;s the rate, it seems I&#39;m better off just taking a personal loan for $8k-$10k for a term of 60 months, under 10% APY, from my local credit union, no? And then maybe using AAVE to lend out my eth or something? That part at least seems like it may be worth it? And I am probably dumb for just sitting on all that eth for so long and not doing anything with it, but... I&#39;m just so nervous I&#39;m going to lose it doing something stupid and feel safer with it sitting on my ledger until I need it ::shrug:: </p>\n\n<p>tips for a stupid dude that needs money for genuinely important things? </p>\n\n<p>tl;dr: understanding defi better; re: loans/aave/defi vs tradfi (why, if APY = similar?)</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-13 13:29:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mxk6861","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1la8krf","parent_id":"t3_1la8krf","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TheHansGruber","body":"When you provide an asset (eth, stablecoins, etc) to a platform like aave, you have the option, but not the obligation, to enable the asset as collateral. \n\nIf you choose to enable it as collateral, those assets will be *earning* interest at a rate that is decided by the current market conditions.
