It emphasizes ETH&#39;s scarcity due to burning, its programmability, and its role as infrastructure rather than speculation, projecting values like $8,000, $80,000, and even $740,000. The video draws a parallel to oil&#39;s role in the industrial revolution, suggesting ETH is building &quot;digital civilizations.&quot; Given the video&#39;s portrayal of ETH as &quot;digital oil,&quot; do you think this comparison accurately captures its role and potential, or does it oversimplify the differences between physical resources like oil and digital assets like ETH?
