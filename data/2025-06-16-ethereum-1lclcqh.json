We were in the pub as a group and we variously spoke about startup banks like Revolut, Starling, Monzo, and whether they are regulated within the UK and safe to put money into, even if only for the purposes of sending across borders, converting between currencies and then withdrawing immediately to minimise exposure to (potentially) unregulated companies. \n\nIt's important to note that I didn't once mention cryptocurrency because I couldn't think of a crypto-based solution to the problem of converting EUR to GBP without routing via USD in some way using a cex like coinbase. E.g. mum deposits EUR to coinbase, converts Eur-->usdc on coinbase, mum sends usdc to daughter, daughter sells usdc to GBP, daughter withdraws GBP. \n\nDuring the conversation I was asked by Anna's husband John whether there was a crypto way to do it, and I explained the above and said the only bit worth doing would be the sending, and I used Base network as an example, because it would cost less than $0.01 to send usdc from mother to daughter, but the reality being that coinbase fees would mean it would probably even out vs just using a startup bank to do the converting and sending.\n\nEven hinting at the suggestion of using crypto made Anna angry, she said she would never use crypto. I asked why not. She didn't seem ready for this question so her response was a few seconds of angry silence followed by: \"Because of every reason imaginable\" said with an intonation that made it sound like I should already know all the reasons why she wouldn't want to use crypto to solve this problem. I was feeling antagonistic after a couple of pints so rather than leave it there I followed up with: \"Ok, but that isn't an actual reason; do you have any specific reasons why you wouldn't use crypto to do this if it was cheaper and easier than the way your mum currently does it?\" Anna replied: \"Because it uses obscene amounts of energy.\" So I said \"not all cryptos do; you're thinking of bitcoin.\" Anna said \"not all\" in a sarcastic manner and I said something similarly sarcastic about not hearing any complaints about the energy consumption of Netflix and we left it there and the group conversation moved on.

And I&#39;ve done EUR and GBP too.</p>\n\n<p>It does work. The Monerium side is seamless. My linked wallet is actually a Safe account with 2/2 for &gt;100 transfers, and 1/2 for &lt;100 transfers resetting daily. So I&#39;m quite confident on the security side tbh, although I don&#39;t keep as much balance.</p>\n\n<p>The swapping is the part with most friction, but since I have the Safe account, I can easily open the Cowswap widget and it all happens in Safe.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also very convenient for taxes. Minting and swapping count as buy and sell respectively. Swapping and Burning count as sell. </p>\n\n<p>Since it&#39;s all on chain, tax reporting tools pick it up easily (it almost amounts to nothing if you do it same day).</p>\n\n<p>Other Monerium users (not me) report that big amounts sometime trigger AML checks and that can lock funds for a while, same as with any IBAN issuer in the EU.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus: I also have a Gnosis Pay card linked to the Monerium IBAN and I pay with the credit(actually, debit) card and burn the tokens automatically.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly we are almost there in terms of usability. If Monerium offered swaps in-app directly and governments weren&#39;t such bitches about tax events, it&#39;d be a no brainer.</p>\n\n<p>But for the use case mentioned by the OP, this is still worth it. Gnosis is a GREAT sister chain of Ethereum.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-16 16:34:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"my3tmje","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lclcqh","parent_id":"t1_my3qj3b","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Few-Bake-6463","body":"Thank you!
