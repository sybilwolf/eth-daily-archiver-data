When I block someone, I want them to vanish!</p>\n\n<p>If you are running uBlock Origin and RES, it&#39;s dead-simple to add a custom rule to obliterate those people from existence. The rule I posted previously was overly aggressive and also hid severely downvoted comments from people you may not have blocked. I have fixed this with an updated rule:</p>\n\n<p><code>www.reddit.com##.comment.collapsed.collapsed-for-reason .collapsed-reason:has-text(/^blocked user$/):upward(3)</code></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-17 18:45:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"myb86rd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ldfmrr","parent_id":"t3_1ldfmrr","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}}}
