In a late stage capitalism endgame AI will not subjugate humanity by its choice; humanity will do this to itself. Furthermore, you can\u2019t expect this technology to slow down. The stakes are too high; the momentum is already too great. Instead we need to prepare for this future. We need to scale up investments in technologies that preserve a place for humanity in the world. This includes [human coordination](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/human-coordination/) technologies I write about frequently, but also we need to prepare defensive applications of AI that can protect you from the biases and extractive interests of those currently investing hundreds of billions a year into this grand endeavor. If the problem with using AI for information retrieval is bias injection then having a defensive AI detect and strip those biases is the answer. This is similar to ad-block in your browser today. If the problem with using AI for automation is that you aren\u2019t being compensated for your subject matter expertise then building a personal or community AI you can monetize is the answer. We need to accelerate AI in a [defensive way](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html). To accomplish this we need to focus on making model creation accessible to the masses.\n\nThis gets a little technical but here\u2019s an incomplete list of technologies we should focus on developing:\n\n* Models need ownership frameworks and those owners need to be able to monetize use. This is important to fund the creation of the model but a revenue stream from model ownership is also the answer to having all of your skills monetized and being made obsolete. This is possible in multiple ways using either privacy technologies like MPC (Multi-Party Computation) or special ways of encrypting the data so decryption is required at the time of use.\n\n* Personal data needs to be more readily convertible to a training-ready format. Training data needs to be curated by little more than watching you perform skills. Historical data needs to be convertible to training data in bulk by doing little more than granting permission to access it.\n\n* Data labeling for more complex tasks needs to be crowd-sourced. If you are using AI today you are already crowd sourcing this data for the tech giants but we can create platforms that let you do this to earn partial ownership of the models that train using the data you label.\n\n* Community models will require governance frameworks which are more sophisticated than the tools we have today to manage patching open source code.\n\n* Hardware for training the model needs to be widely accessible without relying on large cloud providers like AWS. Literally billions of people aren\u2019t able to create AWS accounts. This will require a globally accessible supply of hardware which can be accessed without KYC and with little more than a mobile phone or a decade old laptop.\n\n* The cost of creating models needs to be reduced by orders of magnitude. This can be done in two ways. First, a public listing of models and some type of benchmark of their competencies will let you reduce costs by starting training with a model which is already competent at similar tasks. Second, if we create peer-to-peer markets for enterprise grade hardware we can reduce the exploitive margins the largest cloud providers charge.\nThe technical competence of training needs to be accessible without an interview process. The cleanest way to do this is to create job-board style marketplaces where those with this expertise can bid against each other to guarantee a fair rate while making this skillset available to whomever needs it.\n\n* Individuals need to be able to protect their data sets while accessing this hardware. This can be achieved with TEE\u2019s (Trusted Execution Environment) if done very carefully.\nAI inference needs to be viable on consumer hardware that can sit beside the owner. This is possible by either training on much smaller models to start or by training large models and then discarding weights that weren\u2019t relevant to the specialization training set. I\u2019ve seen specialized models which were 90% smaller than frontier LLMs they were trained from without sacrificing task competency.\n\n* AIs need to be composable into agentic-meshes so many smaller AIs can be combined to complete more complex tasks.\n\nTogether these advances can enable billions of people to create small scale personal and community AIs. Can this be done? Can you really build an AI without hiring a team of data scientists and running your own AI company? Can an AI you make really compete without the same scale of capital as the leading players today? It\u2019s actually more viable than you probably think. With respect to capital investment, AIs with narrower focus and higher quality data can be made effective at tasks with exponentially less data and capital investment than the AGI efforts of the tech giants. With respect to technical skill, solutions to all of this are already in development in an ecosystem called [Decentralized AI](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/demystifying-the-crypto-x-ai-stack).\n\nFull post is available on [my blog](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/ai-endgame).","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Concluding my AI Endgame <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kklbna/daily_general_discussion_may_12_2025/mry7owy/?context=3\">post series.</a></p>\n\n<p>Regardless of the path we take as a species it\u2019s worth noting this isn\u2019t AI\u2019s fault.
