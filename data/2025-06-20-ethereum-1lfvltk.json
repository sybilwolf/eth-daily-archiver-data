This could easily happen in 8-15 years.</p>\n\n<p>Several altcoins have experienced 51% attacks such as <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/blog/a-deep-dive-into-the-recent-bch-hard-fork-incident\">BCH</a>, <a href=\"https://coingeek.com/faqs-july-2021-block-withholding-re-organisation-attack-on-the-bsv-network/\">BSV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dci.mit.edu/projects/51-percent-attacks\">many others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin hash rate can climb without bitcoin security increasing. This is because the only thing that matters is cost of attack, not compute power. Per moore&#39;s law, if Bitcoin hash rate doubles every two years, then this effectively means no change in bitcoin security as the same amount of money is needed to attack (TH/s get&#39;s cheaper every year).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-20 15:44:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mytvllf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lfvltk","parent_id":"t1_mytn532","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Numerous_Ruin_4947","body":"The decaying block rewards become problematic sooner that 100 years from now:\n\nBITCOIN BLOCK REWARDS\n\n3.125000 BTC (2024) 1\n\n\\################################################################\n\n1.562500 BTC (2028) 1/2\n\n\\################################\n\n0.781250 BTC (2032) 1/4\n\n\\################\n\n0.390625 BTC (2036) 1/8\n\n\\########\n\n0.195313 BTC (2040) 1/16\n\n\\####\n\n0.097656 BTC (2044) 1/32\n\n\\##\n\n0.048828 BTC (2048) 1/64\n\n\\#","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>The decaying block rewards become problematic sooner that 100 years from now:</p>\n\n<p>BITCOIN BLOCK REWARDS</p>\n\n<p>3.125000 BTC (2024) 1</p>\n\n<p>################################################################</p>\n\n<p>1.562500 BTC (2028) 1/2</p>\n\n<p>################################</p>\n\n<p>0.781250 BTC (2032) 1/4</p>\n\n<p>################</p>\n\n<p>0.390625 BTC (2036) 1/8</p>\n\n<p>########</p>\n\n<p>0.195313 BTC (2040) 1/16</p>\n\n<p>####</p>\n\n<p>0.097656 BTC (2044) 1/32</p>\n\n<p>##</p>\n\n<p>0.048828 BTC (2048) 1/64</p>\n\n<p>#</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-20 22:33:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"myw5obg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lfvltk","parent_id":"t1_mytn532","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/Numerous_Ruin_4947","body":"There\u2019s no guarantee that Bitcoin\u2019s transaction volume or fee revenue will remain steady and reliable.
