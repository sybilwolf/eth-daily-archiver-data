I thought I'd share some notes from my experience with it.  This is not intended as a replacement for carefully reading all documentation.\n  \nMy airgapped environment is [Tails](https://tails.net/), so the only things that persist are the files stored in persistent storage.  With this configuration, here is the workflow:  \n\n[Manually upgrade your Tails to the current version.](https://tails.net/upgrade/tails/index.en.html)  pectra-cli requires a modern libc version.\n  \n**On your online node,** \n\n    git clone https://github.com/Luganodes/pectra-cli.git\n    cd pectra-cli\n    go build -o pectra-cli ./cmd/main.go\n    cp internal/config/abi.json .\n\nAll of the above is covered in the documentation.  However, in order to utilize `sign.go` for offline signing, there are some dependencies that need to be present prior to copying everything to your airgapped environment.  I followed the documentation [here](https://gist.github.com/gmolveau/f09c1038ca622620e54d0579ba06ea96#file-golang_offline-md) to do this.  \n  \n    mkdir vendor\n    cd vendor\n    go mod init test\n\nUse your preferred editor to create `offline_modules.go` within the vendor folder, and paste the following:  \n  \n    package offline_modules\n    \n    import (\n    \t\"encoding/hex\"\n    \t\"encoding/json\"\n    \t\"fmt\"\n    \t\"log\"\n    \t\"os\"\n    \n    \t\"github.com/Luganodes/Pectra-CLI/internal/config\"\n    \t\"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/core/types\"\n    \t\"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rlp\"\n    )\n    \n    func main() {}\n  \nThen run  \n\n    cd ..\n    go mod vendor\n    cp sample_config.json config.json\n\nEdit config.json with your preferred editor.  Keep in mind that if your goal is to consolidate many validators into one, only the target validator needs to be switched to `0x02` type.  All `0x01` type can be consolidated into `0x02`.\n  \nAt this point, you can generate your unsigned transactions for `switch` and `consolidate`.  Take care to rename the `unsigned_tx.json` if you generate both so you can discern between `switch` and `consolidate` transactions.  Also, note that somewhat confusingly, the `--airgapped` (`-a`) flag is used to generate the unsigned transactions on your *online* node.  \n\n    ./pectra-cli switch -c config.json -a\n    mv unsigned_tx.json unsigned_switch.json\n    ./pectra-cli consolidate -c config.json -a\n    mv unsigned_tx.json unsigned_consolidate.json\n\nCopy the pectra-cli folder along with the [latest version of go](https://go.dev/doc/install) to your freshly formatted flash drive.  \n  \n**On your airgapped machine,**  \n\nBoot into Tails and enable the administrator password option prior to startup.  \n  \nInstall Go.  \n`sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local go1.24.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz`  \n  \nEdit `/home/amnesia/.profile` and append the following to the end:  \n`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`  \n  \nRe-load the profile.  \n`source /home/amnesia/.profile`  \n  \nNavigate to the pectra-cli folder and sign your transactions.  \n\n    go run scripts/sign.go unsigned_switch.json  \n    mv signed_tx.json signed_switch.json  \n    go run scripts/sign.go unsigned_consolidate.json\n    mv signed_tx.json signed_consolidate.json  \n  \nCopy the signed transactions to your flash drive.  \n  \n**On your online node,**  \n  \nBroadcast the switch transaction.  \n`./pectra-cli broadcast -f signed_switch.json -c config.json`\n  \nWAIT UNTIL YOUR TARGET VALIDATOR WITHDRAWAL CREDENTIALS ARE CONFIRMED TO BE `0X02` ON CHAIN!
