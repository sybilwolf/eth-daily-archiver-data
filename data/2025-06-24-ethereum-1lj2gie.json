There still is bandwidth, computation and state size, which will limit what you can do on a very powerful single node. Then there is the additional overhead for all nodes to come to a global consensus. This means that it still is impossible to run the whole world on one single unified ledger. \n\nIn my current understanding the goal is to have the following distribution of transactions in the foreseeable future: Ethereum mainnet: 1k-10k tps, Rollups: ~100k tps and non-rollup L2s will do everything beyond that. If one wants to push mainnet further than this, it might only be possible by sacrificing decentralisation. Decentralisation still is necessary to makes sure that the networks is credibly neutral, censorship resistant and resilient. This means if the Ethereum ecosystem wants to grow beyond 10k tps, rollups and non-rollup L2s are still essential as they will handle most (90-99%) of the transactions even in a snarkified Ethereum mainnet future. Overall I expect that mainnet transactions will always have a premium price associated with them. Probably not 100$ per transaction, but Rollups/L2s will be cheaper and therefore naturally attract a different kind of market.\n\nAs a comparison, Visa is said to process about 1700 transaction messages per second on average with peaks of 65k transaction messages. They do not process all transactions from a single data center, they have several (unclear to me how many) over the world, which probably handle the different economic regions with only a relatively small number of transactions crossing these regions. And Visa is just one application. There are many other providers like Visa (Mastercard, American express, paypal,...). There are also many other applications which will probably run on blockchains in the future, like exchanges (NYS, CME), point based loyalty programs, exchanging gaming assets, digital identity, DNS and so many more. This makes it absolutely impossible to run all of them on a single unified ledger even with ultrafast zk proving.\n\nFor Ethereum to reach these levels of transaction throughput there still is a lot of work to do. ZK proving will probably have to become a few orders of magnitude faster to be able to handle 1k to 10k tps in real time. Statelessness is a must. I am not sure how we will handle bandwidth limitations. \n\n\nSources\n\nVisa:\nhttps://corpo rate.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visanet-technology/VisaNet-Network-Processing-Overview.pdf\n\n\nDecentralisation goals with large gaslimits\n\nhttps://ethere um-magicians.org/t/formalizing-decentralization-goals-in-the-context-of-larger-l1-gaslimits-and-2020s-era-tech/23942\n\nEDIT: swapped \"L2s\" -> \"non-rollup L2s\" where necessary to reduce confusion","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Proving is just one of the bottlenecks. There still is bandwidth, computation and state size, which will limit what you can do on a very powerful single node. Then there is the additional overhead for all nodes to come to a global consensus. This means that it still is impossible to run the whole world on one single unified ledger. </p>\n\n<p>In my current understanding the goal is to have the following distribution of transactions in the foreseeable future: Ethereum mainnet: 1k-10k tps, Rollups: ~100k tps and non-rollup L2s will do everything beyond that. If one wants to push mainnet further than this, it might only be possible by sacrificing decentralisation. Decentralisation still is necessary to makes sure that the networks is credibly neutral, censorship resistant and resilient. This means if the Ethereum ecosystem wants to grow beyond 10k tps, rollups and non-rollup L2s are still essential as they will handle most (90-99%) of the transactions even in a snarkified Ethereum mainnet future. Overall I expect that mainnet transactions will always have a premium price associated with them. Probably not 100$ per transaction, but Rollups/L2s will be cheaper and therefore naturally attract a different kind of market.</p>\n\n<p>As a comparison, Visa is said to process about 1700 transaction messages per second on average with peaks of 65k transaction messages. They do not process all transactions from a single data center, they have several (unclear to me how many) over the world, which probably handle the different economic regions with only a relatively small number of transactions crossing these regions. And Visa is just one application. There are many other providers like Visa (Mastercard, American express, paypal,...). There are also many other applications which will probably run on blockchains in the future, like exchanges (NYS, CME), point based loyalty programs, exchanging gaming assets, digital identity, DNS and so many more. This makes it absolutely impossible to run all of them on a single unified ledger even with ultrafast zk proving.</p>\n\n<p>For Ethereum to reach these levels of transaction throughput there still is a lot of work to do. ZK proving will probably have to become a few orders of magnitude faster to be able to handle 1k to 10k tps in real time. Statelessness is a must. I am not sure how we will handle bandwidth limitations. </p>\n\n<p>Sources</p>\n\n<p>Visa:\nhttps://corpo rate.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visanet-technology/VisaNet-Network-Processing-Overview.pdf</p>\n\n<p>Decentralisation goals with large gaslimits</p>\n\n<p>https://ethere um-magicians.org/t/formalizing-decentralization-goals-in-the-context-of-larger-l1-gaslimits-and-2020s-era-tech/23942</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: swapped &quot;L2s&quot; -&gt; &quot;non-rollup L2s&quot; where necessary to reduce confusion</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-25 06:40:55","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-06-25 11:58:33","id":"mznlask","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lj2gie","parent_id":"t1_mzles5r","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/barthib","body":"I thought that rollups were L2s.
