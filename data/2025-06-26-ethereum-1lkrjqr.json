I take the same approach to fighting corruption as Luthen Rael took to the empire. I just want it to get so out of control that the mechanisms it uses are patched.\n\nThe flat and permissionless nature of blockchains align nicely with that philosophy. If the rich get to exploit tax loopholes, so do I. I've written before about tax shenanigans in my [Double Logris post](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-double-logris) or more recently tax advantages with token plays in my [next gen tokens post](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/next-gen-tokens) but I have a few more ideas that I'll be making a short series of posts about.\n\nThe first of these I call Logris' Loans\u2122. Rich people with access to lawyers and private banking relations frequently pay each other using loans. Why? It has different tax implications. We don't have those relations, but we do have a blockchain which can execute all the same legal mechanisms they would without the lawyers. Consider:\n\n1) Extending a credit line to an individual does not count as income for the individual. For example, opening a Visa account isn't a taxable event for the credit extended.\n\n2) Regardless of the origin of the loan, loaned assets on a credit line can be used without paying income tax on them. For example, if I buy a car with my credit card I don't owe taxes on either the car or the money received.\n\n3) Adding to a credit line is not equivalent to loan forgiveness. For example, if Visa chose to offer a higher tier account and expanded the credit line of a cardholder this does not count as loan forgiveness or income for the cardholder.\n\nI will state at this point that there is a federally mandated minimum interest rates on loans for something to count as a loan, but it's less than the T-Bill interest rate. The above three points are already sufficient to do many of the same shenanigans rich people do. On the blockchain several lending protocols have functionality for *delegated credit*. Basically you put up your collateral and rather than borrow yourself you let someone else borrow against them on your behalf. This doesn't sound particularly useful at face value until you consider it as an alternative form of **payment**.\n\nThis has advantages for both parties. For me as a *payer*, I can continue to hold yield bearing assets. Instead of paying you $1, I deposit $2 of interesting bearing stablecoins as collateral, you can borrow $1 against it in whatever form the lending protocol supports. I continue earning the interest on $2. That's nice for me as the payer. For you as the payee, you now have $1 tax free but with a mandatory minimum interest rate attached to it. You can see why this is appealing to rich people who might be paying 50% in income tax. It might take 20 years for that minimum interest payment to catch up with the initial tax hit. Yes the payer can get liquidated for their collateral, it's up to them to manage the LTV when delegating credit.\n\nLet's continue...\n\n4) If the collateral for the [Lombard Loan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_credit) earns money, the tax obligation is on the account earning the money, not an address receiving delegated credit unless that income is used to forgive debt. If a bank earns money on my savings account deposit, I only owe interest on what is paid to me, not all the banks profit. If Circle earns money on T-Bills, you have no tax liability for that as a USDC holder. Similarly, dividends from a Lombard loan collateral create no tax obligation to you if you don't receive them.\n\n5) Credit can be extended by any party to any party for any reason without duration limits. The nature of why a credit line is extended is immaterial for legal purposes.\n\n6) Payment received by a charity from a third party in exchange for work done for that charity has no tax implications for you. For example if I take a bet online and the terms are that the loser has to give $1M to the make a wish foundation, I don't owe taxes on that $1M if I win. Similarly I could perform work for the make a wish foundation as celebrity or something and my compensation for that work could be someone donating to the foundation. Weird but ok right?\n\nI'm a bit nutty from my time in The Rabbit Hole so bear with me. We create a charity org that manages a smart contract that wraps the lending protocol. The charity transfers the usual benefits of the above loan system to the payee. The mandatory interest rate is collected from income on the collateral and is used to fund the EF or protocol guild or something. Some fees are taken to pay for the operation of the charity. The remainder is carried forward to the payee not as loan forgiveness but as an expansion of the credit line.\n\nRecapping. The payer donates money to this charity and earmarks a payee with that donation. The charity smart contract deposits this money to a lending protocol and delegates the credit for that deposit to the payee. The payee can borrow at some LTV (let's call this 50%). So the payee gets less money in total but the payment is tax free since it's being received by drawing from a credit line. If you're in Canada or otherwise have a lot of income you're probably paying close to 50% taxes anyway so you walk away with about same money but now you're earning interest on the collateral indefinitely which is credited to you as an expansion of your credit line which avoids tax implications to you.\n\nAs you earn money you just live off a perpetually expanding credit line and never owe income tax. Meanwhile we've funded the EF or another Ethereum aligned charity with this scheme at the governments expense. IANAL but I have consulted one. The scheme holds up reasonably well to US law at least but we could base the charity in any tax jurisdiction in the world if it's even more favorable there.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>When it comes to corruption, I am an accelerationist.

I&#39;ve written before about tax shenanigans in my <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-double-logris\">Double Logris post</a> or more recently tax advantages with token plays in my <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/next-gen-tokens\">next gen tokens post</a> but I have a few more ideas that I&#39;ll be making a short series of posts about.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these I call Logris&#39; Loans\u2122. Rich people with access to lawyers and private banking relations frequently pay each other using loans. Why? It has different tax implications. We don&#39;t have those relations, but we do have a blockchain which can execute all the same legal mechanisms they would without the lawyers. Consider:</p>\n\n<p>1) Extending a credit line to an individual does not count as income for the individual. For example, opening a Visa account isn&#39;t a taxable event for the credit extended.</p>\n\n<p>2) Regardless of the origin of the loan, loaned assets on a credit line can be used without paying income tax on them. For example, if I buy a car with my credit card I don&#39;t owe taxes on either the car or the money received.</p>\n\n<p>3) Adding to a credit line is not equivalent to loan forgiveness. For example, if Visa chose to offer a higher tier account and expanded the credit line of a cardholder this does not count as loan forgiveness or income for the cardholder.</p>\n\n<p>I will state at this point that there is a federally mandated minimum interest rates on loans for something to count as a loan, but it&#39;s less than the T-Bill interest rate. The above three points are already sufficient to do many of the same shenanigans rich people do. On the blockchain several lending protocols have functionality for <em>delegated credit</em>. Basically you put up your collateral and rather than borrow yourself you let someone else borrow against them on your behalf. This doesn&#39;t sound particularly useful at face value until you consider it as an alternative form of <strong>payment</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This has advantages for both parties. For me as a <em>payer</em>, I can continue to hold yield bearing assets. Instead of paying you $1, I deposit $2 of interesting bearing stablecoins as collateral, you can borrow $1 against it in whatever form the lending protocol supports. I continue earning the interest on $2. That&#39;s nice for me as the payer. For you as the payee, you now have $1 tax free but with a mandatory minimum interest rate attached to it. You can see why this is appealing to rich people who might be paying 50% in income tax. It might take 20 years for that minimum interest payment to catch up with the initial tax hit. Yes the payer can get liquidated for their collateral, it&#39;s up to them to manage the LTV when delegating credit.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s continue...</p>\n\n<p>4) If the collateral for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_credit\">Lombard Loan</a> earns money, the tax obligation is on the account earning the money, not an address receiving delegated credit unless that income is used to forgive debt. If a bank earns money on my savings account deposit, I only owe interest on what is paid to me, not all the banks profit. If Circle earns money on T-Bills, you have no tax liability for that as a USDC holder. Similarly, dividends from a Lombard loan collateral create no tax obligation to you if you don&#39;t receive them.</p>\n\n<p>5) Credit can be extended by any party to any party for any reason without duration limits. The nature of why a credit line is extended is immaterial for legal purposes.</p>\n\n<p>6) Payment received by a charity from a third party in exchange for work done for that charity has no tax implications for you. For example if I take a bet online and the terms are that the loser has to give $1M to the make a wish foundation, I don&#39;t owe taxes on that $1M if I win. Similarly I could perform work for the make a wish foundation as celebrity or something and my compensation for that work could be someone donating to the foundation. Weird but ok right?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a bit nutty from my time in The Rabbit Hole so bear with me. We create a charity org that manages a smart contract that wraps the lending protocol. The charity transfers the usual benefits of the above loan system to the payee. The mandatory interest rate is collected from income on the collateral and is used to fund the EF or protocol guild or something. Some fees are taken to pay for the operation of the charity. The remainder is carried forward to the payee not as loan forgiveness but as an expansion of the credit line.</p>\n\n<p>Recapping. The payer donates money to this charity and earmarks a payee with that donation. The charity smart contract deposits this money to a lending protocol and delegates the credit for that deposit to the payee. The payee can borrow at some LTV (let&#39;s call this 50%). So the payee gets less money in total but the payment is tax free since it&#39;s being received by drawing from a credit line. If you&#39;re in Canada or otherwise have a lot of income you&#39;re probably paying close to 50% taxes anyway so you walk away with about same money but now you&#39;re earning interest on the collateral indefinitely which is credited to you as an expansion of your credit line which avoids tax implications to you.</p>\n\n<p>As you earn money you just live off a perpetually expanding credit line and never owe income tax. Meanwhile we&#39;ve funded the EF or another Ethereum aligned charity with this scheme at the governments expense. IANAL but I have consulted one. The scheme holds up reasonably well to US law at least but we could base the charity in any tax jurisdiction in the world if it&#39;s even more favorable there.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-26 18:51:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"mzxkhb9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lkrjqr","parent_id":"t3_1lkrjqr","score":26,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Plastic-Ad8652","body":"Very interesting concept.
