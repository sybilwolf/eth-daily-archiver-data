At the Berlin interop meeting last week George Kadianakis, from the EF zkEVM team, proposed a multi step roadmap.\n\nIn a first step (Q4 2025), zk proofs will be added to the chain. The clients do not have to verify them, but they are there for everyone to use.  A next step (Q2 2026) makes proofs mandatory to attest to blocks. Clients will reject blocks without a valid proof. The last step, coming in 2027/2028 will make provers part of Ethereums core consensus. \n\nThere are various tradeoffs they have discussed. They do not want to have a trusted setup ceremony. This makes proof sizes larger, but removes trust assumptions and gives post-quantum security thanks to the use of STARKS instead of SNARKS. Proof sizes should be smaller than 300kB and the goal is to bring them to 128 kB with further optimizations. Currently, an average block is around 100kB (up to a few MB) and each blob adds another 128kB. Block sizes roughly scale with the gas limit and total blob sizes with the number of blobs. Zk proofs should be about the same size, independent of the number of transactions that are proven with a single proof. That is where the scaling advantage comes from. \n\nIn my understanding this is just a proposed roadmap. It will be refined and some of the steps will probably need to be coordinated in a hard fork.
