ZK proving in real time. Jordi was part of polygon until they axed their zk efforts 2-3 weeks ago. Before that he built hermes, a zk rollup similar to zksync light. He has been in the zk space for years now. \n\nHe presented their achievements with ZisK to get to real time proving. Their whole stack seems to be very modularized and easily parallelizable. He had one interesting slide where he showed how their approach scales with number of GPUs. They used H100s, but he says RTX 5090 would be slightly faster and much cheaper. As an example he shows a block which is in the top 5% of expensive blocks to prove.\n\nOn 4 GPUs it takes 95 seconds to prove. On 8 GPUs 49 seconds. All the way up to 64 GPUs it goes down to 11.75 seconds. That is below the slot time. Obviously one needs more statistics to see how well their approach works on a wider range of blocks to see where they really are. But it looks like they achieve real time with fever GPUs than succinct labs SP1. Succinct labs used more, but cheaper GPUs. I guess that is why Jordi was saying that RTX 5090 would even be slightly better as that would put them slightly ahead of succinct labs SP1. \n\nCompared to the ZKsync airbender release last week ZisK is faster, but airbender is much more cost effective as it can run on a single GPU. \n\nAs vitalik said, usable real time proving is more than just showing that you can get a proof in less than 12 seconds on some cases. One needs:\n\n1. Less than slot time (12 seconds) in the worst case.\n\n2. Code needs to be formally verified.\n\n3. Energy consumption per second is also important and not just speed. Ideally, you could run a prover at home.\n\n4. Increasing gas limit increased proving time.

But lowering the entry fee of running a validator just opens itself up to better decentralization. </p>\n\n<p>I guess going back and reading your first comment is where we differ. You actually are in it for seeing tech advancements for blockchain while I\u2019m more about the protection from authority censoring or controlling others. My hope is all of humanity gains the freedom to trustlessly transact without governments or banks saying no, which is why decentralization is so important to me.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-06-30 15:40:29","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n0leb9r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lnz31a","parent_id":"t1_n0kxb9o","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haloooloolo","body":">I\u2019m seeing between 1000-1400 for Solana and a million for Ethereum\n\nThese are not equal. Validators on Solana can have an arbitrary amount of stake, so it's one per entity for the most part. Ethereum is just one per 32 ETH. E.g.

A blockchain doesn't necessarily need to be at the cutting edge of tech to achieve what you want it to. I also think it's very unclear how much decentralization you need for sufficient censorship resistance.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m seeing between 1000-1400 for Solana and a million for Ethereum</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These are not equal.
