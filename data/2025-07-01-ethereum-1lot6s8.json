I am just feeding the rumour mill, but here it comes anyway. The general manager of EigenDA is saying that Robinhood was planning to build everything they released yesterday on Solana. About two months ago this plan changed. They rewrote their implementation to work with Arbitrum and that is what got released yesterday. If this is true I would obviously love to get more information about why they changed their implementation target. \n\nThis timeline fits well with the pretty weird announcement by Kraken together with xStocks releasing stocks on Solana which got publicized about 6 weeks ago. It was weird that the press releases always talked about Solana, even though the stocks also trade on Kraken, Bybit and other chains later on. I guess after losing Robinhood, solana needed a win to not totally lose out on the tokenizing narrative. It also fits that they released this in the same day, but a few hours before the Robinhood announcement to take the wind out of the sail of the Robinhood anouncement and stay relevant. A big part of the narrative of Solana was to become 'Nasdaq on the Blockchain'. It is obviously a pretty heavy blow if Robinhood, one of the largest fintech providers to bring stocks to the masses, uses Arbitrum to do it.\n\n\nxStocks with Kraken is also not the first one to tokenize stocks on chain (See UPDATE below. xStocks is apparently just a brand name of BackedFI). BackedFi also did it at the beginning of the year on various chains (Gnosis, Base, Arbitrum, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and Avalanche). Up until now, these tokenized stocks on the blockchain have not been the most attractive ones, to me at least. The ownership in case of a bankruptcy is not that clear. Dividends are not getting paid out, which is not a big deal for growth stocks, but substantial if you would buy an ETF. As far as I have seen these approaches to tokenize stocks have not been too successful yet. The xStocks implementation also seems to be quite limited, but maybe that is just at the start.\n\nI find it interesting that most (all?) of these stock tokenization projects are from Europe. The Robinhood tokenized stocks are also only available for EU (+EEA) citizens. Seems like regulations in Europe are more favorable for this at the moment. I am sure the US will catch up, but at the moment the show is running outside of the US. Not sure if there could be an issue if an US citizen is buying stocks through cowswap though. \n\n\nSources\n\nSwitch from Solana to Arbitrum:\n\nhttps://xcancel.com/0xkydo/status/1939728017422483695#m\n\nor\n\nhttps://x.com/0xkydo/status/1939728017422483695\n\n\nSome critical look at the xStocks implementation by someone from the Solana ecosystem:\n\nhttps://xcancel.com/laine_sa_/status/1939817097993019436#m\n\nor\n\nhttps://x.com/laine_sa_/status/1939817097993019436\n\nUPDATE: I was not aware, but apparently xStocks is just a brand name to release 55 different stocks and ETFs on chain. But the company behind is just BackedFi. The same company which released tokenized stocks since January on various chains. So, to me it really sounds like Solana needed that win so hard they went all in on the marketing to make sure that the xStocks package sounds as revolutionizing as possible even though it is just the same thing the company did for some time now.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Maybe I am just feeding the rumour mill, but here it comes anyway.

I am very aware about the potential deal they had with Solana. See my post today about the timeline of announcements following when the deal might have fallen apart: https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lot6s8/daily_general_discussion_july_01_2025/n0pyhpd/ Obviously, I would love to get more inside info on how it happened exactly.\n\nI am no interviewer, but I guess if the intention was to ask details about why the deal fell apart it would have been a bit optimistic to get a direct answer from them. In the end they danced around it pretty easily to not upset anyone, so we did not learn too much from it.\n\nIn the second question you specifically said:\n\n\"So, but there is also nothing inherently stopping you guys from issuing these tokens on Solana in the future, right?\"\n\nThat is in my view a very different question than how you tried to described it above. I can not argue with you what your intention was, but by just hearing the question it does not sound to me like a question which just asks about about the fence around their L2. You pretty much state they could deploy on Solana if they wanted to. At least Johann pretty much said no deployment anywhere else, at most bridging of tokens might be possible.\n\nObviously, I am Captain hindsight now, but there would have been so many different ways this question could have been asked. One could have asked about different Rollups, one could have even asked about issuing on Ethereum directly. If the goal was to ask about the wall around their L2 this would have achieved it as well.\n\nThe issue I have with the interviews you did and what prompted the first part of my snippish response is the following. The announcement is a pretty massive verification of the modular roadmap Ethereum has pushed for about 5 years now or so. The execution of the scaling roadmap wasn't (and still isn't) perfect. It took detours had delays and there still are too many things held together by duct tape. Nevertheless, seeing that stocks are getting tokenized in the Ethereum ecosystem by Robinhood is so massive that can hardly be overstated. But in the whole interview you are not even mentioning Ethereum not even once (I am pretty sure I did not miss it). But you mention Solana twice. That is where my snippish first part of the comment comes from.\n\nThe second part of my comment is obviously a bit hyperbolic, but let me elaborate where it comes from.\n\nI have listened to Bankless pretty much from the beginning. I think I missed the first 2 or 3 podcasts. I obviously downloaded them immediately. Ryan and you did an amazing job synthesizing concepts down to their essence and setting them into context. I recommended Bankless to people whenever they asked about a good way to get into the space. I think I did not miss any episode for the first 2-3 years, with the exception of the project specific podcasts which where more shill fest than useful information, at least to me. I also loved the interviews with the Ethereum community members you did. Very different vibe but pretty interesting. Then about a year ago the quality dropped massively. The guests had a free rein on the show stating wrong things up to outright misinformation. Here is my write up from the Bankless podcast with Max Resnick: https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fowp6i/daily_general_discussion_september_25_2024/lotrw6t/  At this point it got obvious to me that the signal to noise ration turned so bad on the normal Bankless episodes that I pretty much stopped listening to the Mondays and Tuesdays episodes with the exception if there is an interesting guest on. The Rollup still is on my normal listen to list, but I definitely also listen to it with more delay than before. That is where the \"Oh how the mighty have fallen\" hyperbole came from. \n\nGenerally, I love getting into different ecosystems trying to understand their tradeoffs and goals. I listen to the Epicenter podcast, which has quite a bit from the Cosmos ecosystem. The zk podcast which covers a huge range of projects, zk rollups, privacy preserving L1s and also snarkified L1s. Unchained has some good guest here and there talking about different ecosystems. Hey, even the PMFers podcast interviewed a Solana dev and discussed the pros and cons of that ecosystem. My impression was that the Bankless interviews with different ecosystems where just not very helpful in understanding them. One can blame the guest or the interviewers in the end I just did not get too much useful information out of it. I am sure, the Solana ecosystem has some great people to interview which are able to discuss their ecosystem in an intellectualy honest way. Toly and Samani are just not these people. Same with many other guests covering different ecosystems. They might give good soundbytes, just not much more. By the way, the podcast where I learned the most about Solana was this episode by Lightspeed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhh4chj-J0I it was with Mert and I was surprised to hear that he has more depth than has twitter personality makes it seem. I have not listened to any other episodes of Lightspeed though.\n\nLong story short my snippish comment comes from a point of disappointment of the direction bankless has taken in the last 12-15 months. As far as I have seen this is a widely shared sentiment which can also be seen in the viewcounts of the bankless youtube channel. Yeah, I did that a few months ago to check myself if my opinion is an outlier or if one can see the change in sentiment in the data. Compared to last autumn Bankless lost about 50% of viewcounts on the youtube channel.

And that is pretty much where I am at. Calling me \"dense\" or a \"tribal investor\" does not really help in this situation.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for the very detailed response and the rational behind your questions. I am very aware about the potential deal they had with Solana. See my post today about the timeline of announcements following when the deal might have fallen apart: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lot6s8/daily_general_discussion_july_01_2025/n0pyhpd/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lot6s8/daily_general_discussion_july_01_2025/n0pyhpd/</a> Obviously, I would love to get more inside info on how it happened exactly.</p>\n\n<p>I am no interviewer, but I guess if the intention was to ask details about why the deal fell apart it would have been a bit optimistic to get a direct answer from them. In the end they danced around it pretty easily to not upset anyone, so we did not learn too much from it.</p>\n\n<p>In the second question you specifically said:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So, but there is also nothing inherently stopping you guys from issuing these tokens on Solana in the future, right?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That is in my view a very different question than how you tried to described it above. I can not argue with you what your intention was, but by just hearing the question it does not sound to me like a question which just asks about about the fence around their L2. You pretty much state they could deploy on Solana if they wanted to. At least Johann pretty much said no deployment anywhere else, at most bridging of tokens might be possible.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, I am Captain hindsight now, but there would have been so many different ways this question could have been asked. One could have asked about different Rollups, one could have even asked about issuing on Ethereum directly. If the goal was to ask about the wall around their L2 this would have achieved it as well.</p>\n\n<p>The issue I have with the interviews you did and what prompted the first part of my snippish response is the following. The announcement is a pretty massive verification of the modular roadmap Ethereum has pushed for about 5 years now or so. The execution of the scaling roadmap wasn&#39;t (and still isn&#39;t) perfect. It took detours had delays and there still are too many things held together by duct tape. Nevertheless, seeing that stocks are getting tokenized in the Ethereum ecosystem by Robinhood is so massive that can hardly be overstated. But in the whole interview you are not even mentioning Ethereum not even once (I am pretty sure I did not miss it). But you mention Solana twice. That is where my snippish first part of the comment comes from.</p>\n\n<p>The second part of my comment is obviously a bit hyperbolic, but let me elaborate where it comes from.</p>\n\n<p>I have listened to Bankless pretty much from the beginning. I think I missed the first 2 or 3 podcasts. I obviously downloaded them immediately. Ryan and you did an amazing job synthesizing concepts down to their essence and setting them into context. I recommended Bankless to people whenever they asked about a good way to get into the space. I think I did not miss any episode for the first 2-3 years, with the exception of the project specific podcasts which where more shill fest than useful information, at least to me. I also loved the interviews with the Ethereum community members you did. Very different vibe but pretty interesting. Then about a year ago the quality dropped massively. The guests had a free rein on the show stating wrong things up to outright misinformation. Here is my write up from the Bankless podcast with Max Resnick: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fowp6i/daily_general_discussion_september_25_2024/lotrw6t/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1fowp6i/daily_general_discussion_september_25_2024/lotrw6t/</a>  At this point it got obvious to me that the signal to noise ration turned so bad on the normal Bankless episodes that I pretty much stopped listening to the Mondays and Tuesdays episodes with the exception if there is an interesting guest on. The Rollup still is on my normal listen to list, but I definitely also listen to it with more delay than before. That is where the &quot;Oh how the mighty have fallen&quot; hyperbole came from. </p>\n\n<p>Generally, I love getting into different ecosystems trying to understand their tradeoffs and goals. I listen to the Epicenter podcast, which has quite a bit from the Cosmos ecosystem. The zk podcast which covers a huge range of projects, zk rollups, privacy preserving L1s and also snarkified L1s. Unchained has some good guest here and there talking about different ecosystems. Hey, even the PMFers podcast interviewed a Solana dev and discussed the pros and cons of that ecosystem. My impression was that the Bankless interviews with different ecosystems where just not very helpful in understanding them. One can blame the guest or the interviewers in the end I just did not get too much useful information out of it. I am sure, the Solana ecosystem has some great people to interview which are able to discuss their ecosystem in an intellectualy honest way. Toly and Samani are just not these people. Same with many other guests covering different ecosystems. They might give good soundbytes, just not much more. By the way, the podcast where I learned the most about Solana was this episode by Lightspeed: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhh4chj-J0I\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhh4chj-J0I</a> it was with Mert and I was surprised to hear that he has more depth than has twitter personality makes it seem. I have not listened to any other episodes of Lightspeed though.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short my snippish comment comes from a point of disappointment of the direction bankless has taken in the last 12-15 months. As far as I have seen this is a widely shared sentiment which can also be seen in the viewcounts of the bankless youtube channel. Yeah, I did that a few months ago to check myself if my opinion is an outlier or if one can see the change in sentiment in the data. Compared to last autumn Bankless lost about 50% of viewcounts on the youtube channel. I obviously have no info about all the other channels or if the whole crypto ecosystem just changed in that period. But it was a great indication  that I am not alone with my sentiment. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I am very thankful for what Bankless did in forming my view on the crypto space and I really hope there is a way to find back to the quality it once had. Not everyone has the same taste and goals listening to a podcast. So I think it is also ok if Bankless changes the direction it is taking for getting a new audience, but then it is no surprise that a portion of the former listeners is being disappointed. And that is pretty much where I am at. Calling me &quot;dense&quot; or a &quot;tribal investor&quot; does not really help in this situation.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-02 07:52:27","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-07-02 08:12:51","id":"n0wmo7u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lot6s8","parent_id":"t1_n0uusrx","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TrustlessStateETH","body":"thanks - theres a lot here so i'll respond to the things that stand out to me. \n\nThe idea of 'counting the times' i mention Ethereum or Solana doesn't seem productive to me.

I personally strife for intellectual honesty, which is close to being neutral but not always the same. My criticism is that in the last 12-15 months Bankless lost a lot of the intellectual honesty. Suddenly there were a lot of people on the show propagating false facts as truths and shitting on things which do not make too much sense. It is not enough being a neutral medium and give equal airtime to everyone to be trustworthy. One has to keep the guests accountable as well. My point is if you simply have more extreme viewpoints on the show it does not make it neutral it makes it untrustworthy. Having these kind of guests on and still being useful is only possible with stronger moderation or what is probably easier having a good selection of guests. Or in other words, if one organizes a panel with all the political authoritarian leaders in the world, the listener would not learn anything about the benefits of democracy, but they would have to endure a shouting match of different incoherent worldviews. I hope that makes sense. And that is what happened in my view in the last 12-15 months with Bankless.\n\nI personally stay in the Ethereum space not because I have Ethereum bags. But because I like the intellectual honesty many actors have most of the time. I can judge where things are going and why things have been decided in a certain way. That is why I guess the moderation of the guests from the Ethereum space was not always that necessary. But once the doors were widely opened to the more opinionated actors under the banner of neutrality the non-moderation approach fell flat and made Bankless, at least to me, unusable. As mentioned in the first post, I am sure there are intelectually honest people in many areas of the crypto space one just has to find them. Look for example what guests Epicenter brings on. Not all of them are high impact guests but some of them have been amazingly good. Just to reiterate I do not want to tell you how to run your platform, you can do it in whatever way you think is best.

I tried to look at other podcasts as well back then to correct for the market shift and yes many of them have been down as well. Some not so much but still the overall trend was in that direction. One can also see it in the whole crypto space. Many discords are ghost towns and a shadow of their former self compared to the high times just 2-3 years ago. So, one could probably say that reaching a wider audience with the approach that Bankless has chosen was not as successful as one could have hoped. \n\nIn my personal view Bankless has improved again since Ryan is back. And no, I do not want to imply Bankless with Ryan only would be a better Bankless.
