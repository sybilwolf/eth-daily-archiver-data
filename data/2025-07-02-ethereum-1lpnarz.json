That is why they massively invested in Backedfi. Before that there never was a mention of BackeFi being in any way backed by the Solana foundation or the Solana ecosystem. Now, suddenly there is Solana, Jupiter, Solflare and Raydium on their list. At the same time Kraken and Bybit needed to have a stock avenue as well. So they naturally also went to backedFi. That crypto twitter and sensational crypto journalism made that into Kraken is issuing stocks on Solana is pretty much as wrong as one could get it. Obviously more Solana aligned influencers did not really correct this wrong conclusion or even propagated it. All I have written here is my own conclusion pieced from breadcrumbs here and there and filled with my own bias, so it might be very wrong. Take it with a pinch of salt. \n\nIn the end. BackedFi got a massive boost. Their work got validated by the market. As far as I understand they continuously issue tokens on many different chains and CEXs. They might become an important issuer of tokenized stocks in the future.\n\nRobinhood on Ethereum is obviously a much bigger deal and a massive vindication of the roadmap and approach Ethereum has taken with its scaling roadmap. So, I am very pleased that Robinhood has chosen to go this way. So I totally agree with the \"We are not the same\" take.\n\nIn my view backedfi is currently still the best way to buy stocks on chain on Ethereum and its rollups. Not sure when Robinhood stock tokens become permissionless but they are not at the moment. \n\nGenerally, I am happy with all the projects extending the Ethereum ecosystem even though some take detours to other ecosystems to kickstart their products.\n\nEDIT: I accidentally a word.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I guess your are talking about the xStocks deployment done by BackedFi on Solana on Monday.

They often need to got where the money is in the short term to play out their long term plan. </p>\n\n<p>I wrote about what might have happened in the last 2 months in the tokenization space yesterday: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lot6s8/daily_general_discussion_july_01_2025/n0pyhpd/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1lot6s8/daily_general_discussion_july_01_2025/n0pyhpd/</a></p>\n\n<p>In short: Solana might have needed a win after they realized they are losing Robinhood. That is why they massively invested in Backedfi. Before that there never was a mention of BackeFi being in any way backed by the Solana foundation or the Solana ecosystem. Now, suddenly there is Solana, Jupiter, Solflare and Raydium on their list. At the same time Kraken and Bybit needed to have a stock avenue as well. So they naturally also went to backedFi. That crypto twitter and sensational crypto journalism made that into Kraken is issuing stocks on Solana is pretty much as wrong as one could get it. Obviously more Solana aligned influencers did not really correct this wrong conclusion or even propagated it. All I have written here is my own conclusion pieced from breadcrumbs here and there and filled with my own bias, so it might be very wrong. Take it with a pinch of salt. </p>\n\n<p>In the end. BackedFi got a massive boost. Their work got validated by the market. As far as I understand they continuously issue tokens on many different chains and CEXs. They might become an important issuer of tokenized stocks in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood on Ethereum is obviously a much bigger deal and a massive vindication of the roadmap and approach Ethereum has taken with its scaling roadmap. So, I am very pleased that Robinhood has chosen to go this way. So I totally agree with the &quot;We are not the same&quot; take.</p>\n\n<p>In my view backedfi is currently still the best way to buy stocks on chain on Ethereum and its rollups. Not sure when Robinhood stock tokens become permissionless but they are not at the moment. </p>\n\n<p>Generally, I am happy with all the projects extending the Ethereum ecosystem even though some take detours to other ecosystems to kickstart their products.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I accidentally a word.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-02 08:56:07","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-07-02 09:16:00","id":"n0wt3f2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lpnarz","parent_id":"t1_n0wdxoj","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/laninsterJr","body":"How it gonna work during sqlana downtimes?
