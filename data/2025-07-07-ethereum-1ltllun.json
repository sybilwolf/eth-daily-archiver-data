I have a science background, which means I read hundreds of papers to try and distill the useful information out of them and try to decide which are probably the next questions in my field which will bring my research field forward. That is why I have an allergy against people who are just selective in what they show or even decide on the research outcome beforehand and then handpick the data to make a compelling story. These papers sound amazing, but they are full of plot holes. Obviously, the ideas these papers offered died off within a few years, because they were just built on nothing. I encountered quite a few things like that in my career. \n\nSame thing for me in the crypto space. There are uncountable many bad faith actors in our space. Most of them do not even try to show you proper data, if they do, they just misrepresent it. Then you have projects which have the incentive to fake data to then try to show the data off as how successful they are. Many such projects unfortunately. Then there are those people who want to sell you their own bags. They are very well funded and write tons of 'research' reports about why this thing is the hottest new thing now. Their 'research' is full of plot holes but it sounds credible enough to spin the narrative. They have their own podcast to further reach out and convince people that their story is the one which wins out. In the end, one just becomes their exit liquidity. \n\nIn the Ethereum space there is a pocket of people which do not do that. Don't get me wrong, the Ethereum space also has a lot of bad actors, but my impression from all the crypto spaces I have been into in the last 15 years or so it is one of the few which have that. Bitcoin had it for quite some time. I also always had a weak spot for Zcash. But the Ethereum community is pretty much the only one where I see intellectual honesty being relatively widespread today.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I just wrote a few days ago that the main reason I am still here and my ETH bags are unreasonably overweight, is because of the intellectual honesty many in the Ethereum space show. I have a science background, which means I read hundreds of papers to try and distill the useful information out of them and try to decide which are probably the next questions in my field which will bring my research field forward. That is why I have an allergy against people who are just selective in what they show or even decide on the research outcome beforehand and then handpick the data to make a compelling story. These papers sound amazing, but they are full of plot holes. Obviously, the ideas these papers offered died off within a few years, because they were just built on nothing. I encountered quite a few things like that in my career. </p>\n\n<p>Same thing for me in the crypto space. There are uncountable many bad faith actors in our space. Most of them do not even try to show you proper data, if they do, they just misrepresent it. Then you have projects which have the incentive to fake data to then try to show the data off as how successful they are. Many such projects unfortunately. Then there are those people who want to sell you their own bags. They are very well funded and write tons of &#39;research&#39; reports about why this thing is the hottest new thing now. Their &#39;research&#39; is full of plot holes but it sounds credible enough to spin the narrative. They have their own podcast to further reach out and convince people that their story is the one which wins out. In the end, one just becomes their exit liquidity. </p>\n\n<p>In the Ethereum space there is a pocket of people which do not do that. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the Ethereum space also has a lot of bad actors, but my impression from all the crypto spaces I have been into in the last 15 years or so it is one of the few which have that. Bitcoin had it for quite some time. I also always had a weak spot for Zcash.

Staking ETH at scale doesn\u2019t directly secure stablecoins, but it can strengthen Ethereum\u2019s base layer - indirectly making everything built on it, including stablecoins, more robust. The real idea is aligning long-term incentives between large players and the protocol.
