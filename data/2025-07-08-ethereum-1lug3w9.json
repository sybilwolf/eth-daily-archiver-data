In my opinion the answer is actually yes, but it's subtle.\n\nOne reason to do so is censorship and soft-forms of censorship. If you own 5% of the total amount staked you can be sure that on average 1 in 20 blocks are produced by you and will include your transactions. In that case you can only be delayed, but your transactions will always be included eventually (on average in 20 blocks). But this is the extreme case of total censorship, where everyone wants to block your transactions. In practice, for financial institutions, small amounts of censorship can also matter because they translate in slight disadvantages in terms of transaction inclusion which result in small but profitable long-term opportunities for your adversaries. So in fact, you are incentivized to stake ETH to match your competitors. Imagine JP Morgan owned 1% of staked ETH, while Citigroup owned 0%. If JP Morgan where to censor Citigroup's transactions, then 1 in 100 blocks would give a slight advantage in terms of trade execution to JP Morgan.\n\nDoes this mean your settlement on Ethereum is at risk if you don't stake ETH? Not at all. But for financial institutions where very small small advantages in trade execution matter, it does make sense to have a stake on the network. Following this line of thinking you can see the advantages of a public network with credible neutrality. The fact the stake is very well spread across many different non-colluding actors is a huge benefit for financial institutions. It means the network is a leveled playing field by default, and you only need to match a small % of the total stake to match your competitors to ensure no small advantages through soft-censorship creep up.\n\nContrast this with the situation over Solana, where the stake is basically owned by the Solana Foundation: https://x.com/0xkydo/status/1915212191655182666?t=euMwfc6Hwp26p5zET9oAAQ \nAre you willing to settle over Solana not knowing if some backalley deal is giving an unfair advantage to Jump Crypto?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There seems to be an ongoing discussion whether a financial institution that settles on Ethereum has a self-interest to stake ETH and secure the chain.
