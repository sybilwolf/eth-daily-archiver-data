Here's a few specific things I would tweak, personally.\n\nAs I said, all super subjective and the other comment saying that it looks like Grafana is also bang on... but I think that also describes my stance pretty accurately. Grafana is designed primarily for devs and the look & feel is developer-y as a result, in large orgs you basically *never* see business/marketing/finance people using Grafana-looking tooling and they always have something a bit more BI-looking.\n\nBut also this depends completely on the goals of GTP as well. Seeing some of your updates I get the feeling that you also want to catch the eye of business people in organisations and hopefully surface some stats to C-level decision makers - correct me if I'm wrong here - but if that's true these are the couple of things that I feel detract from that professional look & feel. I'll stop disclaimering these are subjective from here on, hopefully you get that I mean this constructively:\n\n**1) Gradients & Fonts**\n\nThe colorscheme is *brutal* (as in the more literal meaning of the word). Very stark and in your face. My simple argument would be to check other pro-level dashboarding tools and see how many have yellow-orange gradients, especially applied to text and I think the reason for that is purely that it is rough on the eye.\n\nThe above the fold / top-half of content on this page [https://www.growthepie.com/ethereum-ecosystem/metrics](https://www.growthepie.com/ethereum-ecosystem/metrics) is way too busy in terms of colorscheme to my eye, lacks visual consistency & the gradients cheapen it.\n\nFont's aren't bad per-se but looks a little 'open source' and Ubuntu/Firefoxy. If it was me I'd go for a cleaner looking sand-serif like Open Sans or of that ilk.\n\n**2) Border Radiuses**\n\nTo me everything it too rounded and [bouba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect) and I think you'd want to be a kiki here. I'm suggesting way tighter radiuses and possibly even more rectangular boxes rather than the bubbly look & feel that's currently on there.\n\nGenerally it feels too soft & bubbly and I feel like it ought to push towards sharp & snappy.\n\n**3) Information Density**\n\nCan be increased. Fonts and navigation feels a bit large to my eyes but this one is tricky and its hard to get the right balance. I feel this point more on mobile than on desktop as it can feel like there's only one thing visible at any given time when on the mobile view.\n\nMobile screens are way more pixel dense these days and you can generally push the font size down a few notches in order to fit in more information.\n\nBut to be clear I'm not a designer and this comes from doing dashboard work as a dev so you may not want to take all my points wholesale here... I've just sent over a 200 USDT donation on Arbitrum if you're able to tap up a dashboard designer for a quick consultation, even if they prove me wrong entirely :D","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for taking it in the spirit I meant it by - was really trying not to sound like a dick.

My simple argument would be to check other pro-level dashboarding tools and see how many have yellow-orange gradients, especially applied to text and I think the reason for that is purely that it is rough on the eye.</p>\n\n<p>The above the fold / top-half of content on this page <a href=\"https://www.growthepie.com/ethereum-ecosystem/metrics\">https://www.growthepie.com/ethereum-ecosystem/metrics</a> is way too busy in terms of colorscheme to my eye, lacks visual consistency &amp; the gradients cheapen it.</p>\n\n<p>Font&#39;s aren&#39;t bad per-se but looks a little &#39;open source&#39; and Ubuntu/Firefoxy. If it was me I&#39;d go for a cleaner looking sand-serif like Open Sans or of that ilk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Border Radiuses</strong></p>\n\n<p>To me everything it too rounded and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect\">bouba</a> and I think you&#39;d want to be a kiki here. I&#39;m suggesting way tighter radiuses and possibly even more rectangular boxes rather than the bubbly look &amp; feel that&#39;s currently on there.</p>\n\n<p>Generally it feels too soft &amp; bubbly and I feel like it ought to push towards sharp &amp; snappy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3) Information Density</strong></p>\n\n<p>Can be increased. Fonts and navigation feels a bit large to my eyes but this one is tricky and its hard to get the right balance. I feel this point more on mobile than on desktop as it can feel like there&#39;s only one thing visible at any given time when on the mobile view.</p>\n\n<p>Mobile screens are way more pixel dense these days and you can generally push the font size down a few notches in order to fit in more information.</p>\n\n<p>But to be clear I&#39;m not a designer and this comes from doing dashboard work as a dev so you may not want to take all my points wholesale here... I&#39;ve just sent over a 200 USDT donation on Arbitrum if you&#39;re able to tap up a dashboard designer for a quick consultation, even if they prove me wrong entirely :D</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-11 03:44:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n2hlwza","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lw49ux","parent_id":"t1_n2fk007","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/growthepie_eth","body":"Thanks for the donation!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for the donation!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-11 08:12:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n2iiapx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lw49ux","parent_id":"t1_n2hlwza","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Epicgoblet","body":"Sharplink with an 8000 ETH buy this morning!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Sharplink with an 8000 ETH buy this morning!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-10 11:54:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n2cjjjx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lw49ux","parent_id":"t3_1lw49ux","score":50,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/earthquakequestion","body":"I realize how stupid it would be and only cost them money but I wish they wouldn't buy it OTC and would just do a straight market buy so I can watch it just eat into any walls really quickly and get some additional momentum behind the price.\n\nBut either way, love seeing their continued purchases.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I realize how stupid it would be and only cost them money but I wish they wouldn&#39;t buy it OTC and would just do a straight market buy so I can watch it just eat into any walls really quickly and get some additional momentum behind the price.</p>\n\n<p>But either way, love seeing their continued purchases.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-10 12:28:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n2cotrn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1lw49ux","parent_id":"t1_n2cjjjx","score":12,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/majorpickle01","body":"ETH bought OTC is ETH not being dumped for a cash out on open market, is the flip side.
