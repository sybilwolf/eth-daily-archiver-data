The less Eth supply.</p>\n\n<p>As Eth price goes up &quot;ALL&quot; of their valuations go up. They &quot;ALL&#39; are able to borrow more fiat and buy more Eth and the fly wheel continues to spin.</p>\n\n<p>The big difference between BTC and Eth is:</p>\n\n<p>Eth has lower inflation and no miner sell pressure. As time goes by it only becomes harder for BTC to outperform Eth.</p>\n\n<p>Eth strategic reserve companies were the missing piece to the puzzle. Eth supply needs to be reduced while it continues to gain adoption.</p>\n\n<p>Currently there are just a few Eth strategy reserve companies but there will be many more. Low hanging fruit are the other 20 public BTC mining companies that could profit a lot more switching to Eth. They would be able to stake and keep Eth instead of having to sell BTC to pay for mining costs.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of Stable coins and tokenization will be on Eth. L2s will also grow causing Eth ecosystem to grow exponentially. As transactions spike more Eth will be burned further reducing inflation.</p>\n\n<p>Doesn&#39;t take as much money to move Eth as btc so once Eth starts pumping hard, Joe Lubin and Tom Lee will be educating the masses. Masses will go buy ETFs or Eth reserve stock. (Fueling the flywheel)</p>\n\n<p>What im saying is buckle up. Things are getting real.

There is no universal proof that it is impossible to find a very fast algorithm to solve these problems. We just assume they are hard.

So, the goal is now to find a problem which, by just making the key a little bit longer, makes it exponentially harder for quantum computers to solve it. There are some problems which are known are really hard for quantum computers to solve. The two most promising ones are hash based problems used for example in zk-STARKs or lattice based problems. Both of these approaches make it exponentially harder for quantum computers to solve them by increasing the key size just a little bit.
