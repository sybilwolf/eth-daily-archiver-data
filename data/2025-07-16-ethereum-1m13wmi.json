Glamsterdam is the upgrade after Fusaka and is expected to come in 2026. Implementations take time, so they are now defining what the big EIPs will be. \n\nThere are a few candidates ones on the list.\n\n- EIP-7732: ePBS. Enshrined proposer builder separation. Will change how blocks are produced and how validators pick which blocks to publish. Gets rid of the trust needed with relays. Also changes how much time in each slot is used to validate, attest and propagate blocks. More time means more scalability.\n\n- EIP-7782: Reduce slot time to 6 seconds. This is an obvious UX improvement.\n\n- EIP-7805: FOCIL (fork choice enforced inclusion list). This enshrines anti censorship rules in the protocol. \n\n- EIP-7886: Delayed execution. One does not have to re-execute all transactions in a block to attest to it. Can increase scaling.\n\nCurrently it sounds like most teams want ePBS and FOCIL. According to them ePBS is very mature and gives a lot room to scale Ethereum in the future. A disadvantage of ePBS is that local block building is not possible anymore, but FOCIL will force block builders to include certain transactions. In other words, ethereum might get both: efficient (but centralized) block building with full censorship resistance.\n\nReducing the slot time is highly requested from the more application/user side. Consensus client devs argue that having both ePBS and the slot time reduction in the same upgrade is a bit much in terms of testing and debugging. There are also quite a lot of places in the clients and also smart contracts where 12 second slot times are implicitely assumed. These cases need to be identified and analyzed first to estimate the difficulty and dangers of this change.\n\n\nFinally, delayed execution is generally not considered high value. It has some overlap with ePBS, but most the efforts for this EIP will be wasted once ePBS is implemented which change most of the delayed execution code again. \n\nThere is also EIP-7928 which is an execution layer improvement. Which can improve gas costs, execution overhead and parallel transaction execution. The Reth team favors this one.\n\n\nA few teams have released blog posts about what their headliners are and why.
