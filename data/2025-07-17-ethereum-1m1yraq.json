to the Coinbase announcement.\n\nAt first glance I was reminded of 2017-18 era ConsenSys. The company threw an entire pot of spaghetti at the wall to see what would stick. They had Ujo for music, Viant for supply chain, Cellarius for collaborative storytelling, uPort and others for identity, Civil for news, AirSwap for dex, SingularityTV for media production, and more. What eventually stuck? Metamask and Aztec (which was incubated at ConsenSys if memory serves). Basically everything else evaporated. Were they too early? Maybe, what do I know? All I know is that the majority of their projects failed.\n\nIn the Base announcement, creatives and developers described the work they were doing and how it was all enabled by Base. It was awkward and I found myself asking what people in the audience, most of whom were Coinbase employees, must have been thinking. Monetized social media likes? 'is this what we've been building?' Token curated registries that purport democratization but in reality reinforce oligarchy through more tokens = more votes? Is this... good for society? Forget if we actually need this, we don't, but do we event want this? In the last few years we have seen social media take a dark turn; people have discovered that if they can't create or inform, they can become infamous through negativity; people don't care if they're infamous as long as they're famous.\n\nMaybe I'm out of touch, maybe I'm cynical, but I got into this space to disintermediate Uber, not to enrich Coinbase off Andrew Taint posts. The immediate monetization of likes and shares may start off well and good but I am concerned that this is just another medium that will be captured. I see it like this: in the early internet, and in the early crypto space, we had nerds, weirdos, libertarians, techno-optimists, and generally quality information. Today, the popular, rich, and beautiful dominate the internet, promoting swirls of disinformation, and algorithms built by the best and brightest see increasing the share of our waking lives we spend (trapped) inside of them as a profit opportunity, consequences be damned. What used to be a wormhole of information and experience has become a shopping mall in a prison for dopamine addicts (i'm being dramatic i know).\n\nI don't trust a company like Coinbase, beholden to stockholder interests at the core, to usher in a phase of decentralization on the internet or even just social media as they claim they will. I'm not even confident that their vision will even take off considering the friction of getting people to swap apps and payment methods; 1% cashback on USDC purchases requires a user to open a cex account > upload identity docs > set up 2FA > connect to a bank account > deposit funds > figure out how to send funds to a merchant... vs just using their credit card which likely pays at least 1% or more in cashback or points. Getting people to swap messaging apps is even more difficult as a messaging network is only useful if you have people to message on it. It seems more likely that established messaging apps will build in these features as opposed to new messaging apps with the features taking market share. Most people just aren't going to make the switch.\n\nOverall I wasn't expecting anything profound so I'm not disappointed. In terms of our bags I suppose any increase in activity on chain is good for them, but as far as adding value to society I don't know that this is the way.\n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Listened to the Coinbase announcement.</p>\n\n<p>At first glance I was reminded of 2017-18 era ConsenSys.

This classification aims to prevent unregulated secondary market trading but does not specify particular assets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exemptions for Mature Blockchains:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Digital assets on blockchains deemed &quot;mature&quot; or sufficiently decentralized are exempt from SEC registration requirements if their annual sales meet certain thresholds. The bill does not list specific blockchains or assets but provides criteria for decentralization, such as no single entity controlling more than 20% of the network\u2019s voting power or development.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No Specific Asset Mentions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The legislative text avoids referencing individual cryptocurrencies or tokens (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc.) to maintain a technology-neutral approach.
