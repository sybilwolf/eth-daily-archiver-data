At those valuations people are going to be retiring and using ETH sales to power a better lifestyle. So we candle up on rates dropping, we might see some very fun valuations for a month or two just like previous bull markets, then we run out of investor capital to propel treasury companies higher, at the very top the sell pressure from those of us who won this lottery counteracts the last treasury company push, and when it fails to go higher despite all that inflow the markets get scared and we see a dump and another 3 year bear. Then we buy again at the end of 2026 and the cycle repeats.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-18 18:44:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n3v4u1n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m2tibc","parent_id":"t1_n3v1bvy","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"And if rates drop to 1% by end of 26, so for the next 18 months?
