Ethereum was quickly identified as the biggest risk to the financial establishment because it has the first mover advantage in actually revolutionizing how finance is done in the world.\n\n- This means your biggest advocates, your biggest bag holders have had an incentive to lay low and make little noise for very long.\n- In the meantime, VC backed L1s have run psyops campaigns and attempted to extract value from Ethereum, treating the crypto space as a 0 sum game, and their space as a grifting machine.\n- In the middle, you have tons of influencers, CT personalities, bloggers and podcasters (Bankless) riding this scenario by playing into VC money. \n- And finally, Bitcoin looming security budget and miner operation viability issues continue to grow while a few personalities (MSTR) run the last grift towards the sunset.\n\nWhat changed? Well, the pie is getting bigger, TradFi adoption is now inevitable, SEC prosecution has been dropped. \n\nThis means that:\n\n- Ethereum main personalities are now more vocal and feel safe to do so (Lubin, Etherealize is formed, etc)\n- L1 VCs are sidelined, crypto is no longer niche, they are not well positioned to capture new value of the growing pie.\n- Influencers now get to play along and gas light us into thinking they never held altcoin bags and received incentives to run psyops. Even more, now they hold ETH and they turn their signal into positive and bombard us with mindless bull noise.\n- Bitcoin miners slowly start leaving the space and rotating towards ETH as a viable business.\n\nI guess that's the best summary I can get of this perfect storm. The same stupid influencers think this will be *another cycle* which tells you they are looking for signs to rotate their bags *again*. This time might be different. Ethereum might exit the crypto cycle standard as it becomes full of real world applications.\n\nDoes this mean ETH price will go up? I don't know.

Ethereum was quickly identified as the biggest risk to the financial establishment because it has the first mover advantage in actually revolutionizing how finance is done in the world.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This means your biggest advocates, your biggest bag holders have had an incentive to lay low and make little noise for very long.</li>\n<li>In the meantime, VC backed L1s have run psyops campaigns and attempted to extract value from Ethereum, treating the crypto space as a 0 sum game, and their space as a grifting machine.</li>\n<li>In the middle, you have tons of influencers, CT personalities, bloggers and podcasters (Bankless) riding this scenario by playing into VC money. </li>\n<li>And finally, Bitcoin looming security budget and miner operation viability issues continue to grow while a few personalities (MSTR) run the last grift towards the sunset.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What changed? Well, the pie is getting bigger, TradFi adoption is now inevitable, SEC prosecution has been dropped. </p>\n\n<p>This means that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum main personalities are now more vocal and feel safe to do so (Lubin, Etherealize is formed, etc)</li>\n<li>L1 VCs are sidelined, crypto is no longer niche, they are not well positioned to capture new value of the growing pie.</li>\n<li>Influencers now get to play along and gas light us into thinking they never held altcoin bags and received incentives to run psyops. Even more, now they hold ETH and they turn their signal into positive and bombard us with mindless bull noise.</li>\n<li>Bitcoin miners slowly start leaving the space and rotating towards ETH as a viable business.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I guess that&#39;s the best summary I can get of this perfect storm.
