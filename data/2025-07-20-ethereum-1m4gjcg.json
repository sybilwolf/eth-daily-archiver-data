Who is buying CRV at this depeg and why? Why buy CRV when you can buy cxvCRV and get triple the veCRV exposure that way? Either you are buying CRV because you are a DAO and want it to direct issuance to your own pools or you are buying CRV because you want the bribe income. If you are the former, buy CVX instead. It's [at 61% of intrinsic value](https://buycvxcorrect.netlify.app/) so you get 1.5x your bribes this way. If you are the latter, buy a liquid locker token and get almost triple the bribe revenue that way. In either case, no one should just be buying CRV unless they just don't understand the system and are broadly speculating on stablecoin adoption without a clue how these systems work.\n\nFwiw on my end I'm selling the CRV as I farm it.

I don&#39;t understand how the CRV asset price can rise in such conditions. The cvxCRV/CRV ratio was at <a href=\"https://crvhub.com/wrappers\">0.33 the other day</a> while CRV price was ripping. Who is buying CRV at this depeg and why? Why buy CRV when you can buy cxvCRV and get triple the veCRV exposure that way? Either you are buying CRV because you are a DAO and want it to direct issuance to your own pools or you are buying CRV because you want the bribe income. If you are the former, buy CVX instead. It&#39;s <a href=\"https://buycvxcorrect.netlify.app/\">at 61% of intrinsic value</a> so you get 1.5x your bribes this way. If you are the latter, buy a liquid locker token and get almost triple the bribe revenue that way.

Target to cash out 90% of stack was $6500 and hodl the rest, but of course we topped out at 4.8k and I had sold only around 70% by then. But that was good enough. Everyone was calling for 10k but diminishing returns made sense to me and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t join the moonbois.</p>\n\n<p>Point is this time will not be different. I will aim to front run the moonbois by selling a solid % before their first sell target. If we do hit their numbers, I&#39;ll still have a decent stack left to sell. The aim is to not try &amp; sell at the pico-top but to gradually scale out to minimise regret in case of the worst outcome.</p>\n\n<p>So what are the moonbois saying this time? $20k? I&#39;ll be at least 70% out by then, if not more.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-20 16:49:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n46x2zk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m4gjcg","parent_id":"t1_n45ezkd","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/epic_trader","body":"Damn bro you got no chill.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Damn bro you got no chill.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-20 11:55:44","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n45hfan","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m4gjcg","parent_id":"t1_n45dyot","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Sku","body":"Comments on Reddit are meaningless noise, in the larger context of an almost half a trillion dollar asset.
