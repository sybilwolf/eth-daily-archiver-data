They have to take out money to pay developers, that&#39;s their job.</p>\n\n<p>IIUC they didn&#39;t try to get a return on their assets in defi because it has some risk of loss and also some legal risk. If there was a legal issue and they had to help defend people in court they didn&#39;t want to also be the defendant, and if one of the protocols blew up and they made a loss that would have made for terrible PR if the EF had also lost money. At this point I guess they&#39;ve figured the yield outweighs the risk as we have a pretty good idea which protocols tend to be stable and people aren&#39;t really getting prosecuted for using defi.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-25 20:41:56","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n55it90","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m8qf62","parent_id":"t1_n53dzrn","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Flashy-Butterfly6310","body":"How many ETH do you own?\n\nEdit: I see by the downvotws that I'm being too curious ahah","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How many ETH do you own?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I see by the downvotws that I&#39;m being too curious ahah</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-25 15:12:15","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-07-25 15:34:07","id":"n53lbxe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m8qf62","parent_id":"t3_1m8qf62","score":-19,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Wavy_Grandpa","body":"About 3.50\u00a0","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>About 3.50\u00a0</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-25 15:17:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n53mehx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m8qf62","parent_id":"t1_n53lbxe","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/KeyCombination1802","body":"Three fiddy ?","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Three fiddy ?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-26 00:28:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n56of4x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m8qf62","parent_id":"t1_n53mehx","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/mini_miner1","body":"Too many and not enough.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Too many and not enough.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-25 15:49:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n53tgwy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m8qf62","parent_id":"t1_n53lbxe","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/earthquakequestion","body":"No such thing as too many, but I'd say that like you I hold enough...and not enough.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>No such thing as too many, but I&#39;d say that like you I hold enough...and not enough.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-25 16:27:04","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n541gk7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m8qf62","parent_id":"t1_n53tgwy","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Gumpa-Bucky","body":"Sorry, hard to pin down.
