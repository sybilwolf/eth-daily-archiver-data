This was worth about 9.5B USD at that time.

This happened over the timespan of 2 weeks. Then in the last 2 days one can see many even 'smaller' transactions (few hundred BTC) into various CEXs (Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, Binance, OKX, Bybit,...). There was also a lot of transactions dispersing the funds to other addresses controlled by Galaxy digital. There are also many untagged addresses which received a few hundred BTC. A nice one is Fidelity, the BTC ETF issuer, also got 87 BTC, which I would guess they bought OTC.

To me the main question is, since Steam accepted crypto payments for a while years ago, but then <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613\">discontinued the option</a> apparently due to various headaches and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steam-co-founder-reveals-why-211430243.html\">flaws</a> with using Bitcoin for payments, is the technology there yet to resolve the problems they had? Or be an actual viable way of not losing all their revenue if banned by credit card companies?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-27 05:03:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n5dupa5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1m9kuha","parent_id":"t1_n5dpycg","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/cromulent-facts","body":"Because the first real use case for crypto was facilitating socially unacceptable transactions on Silk Road.
