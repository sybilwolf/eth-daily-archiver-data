I can also see the much more complex arrangement in Holy Wars. Guitar solos never were my thing though and are the main reason why I never got into many of the Metal genres and preferred to stay in the punk/crossover genres. I guess if I would have been just a few years older, metal would have been my place to be.</p>\n\n<p>I think what makes Symphony of Destruction for me is just the melody. It embodies going down a dark path to utter annihilation. That is what I resonated with me back then quite a bit and still does today, but mostly for nostalgic reasons. I never owned any Megadeth CDs to listen to, I only ever heard the song when it was on radio or MTV in the 90ies. Nowadays, every other year or so I have the itch to listen to Symphony of Destruction again, and I am still liking it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-28 20:12:30","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n5o5hnn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mb7f6p","parent_id":"t1_n5mrvh5","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"oh man, you\u2019re such a gem.   this warms my heart.

However, when you consider the context in which this 'lack of revenue' occurs, it becomes largely irrelevant.\n\nAt some point Ethereum was the highest revenue chain of all, by FAR, however, this was a result of there being a lot of demand for blockspace, but just not enough supply. Hence why there was constant criticism of its high fees. Now, given the upgrades introduced to the blockchain in the past 2 years (2024 and 2025), plus the existence of L2s, Ethereum has become a lot more scalable and therefore with the growing demand for blockspace, it can now accomodate a lot more transactions.\n\nThis has resulted in a sharp drop in 'chain revenue', meaning there's a lot less fees being collected. However, we must note that had these upgrades not come, even if revenue was 'higher', the chain would be prohibitively expensive to use.\n\nSo while all the comments replying to you are extremely well explained, I also think this detail is very important to point out, given that social media and crypto media sites (which all offer contradicting views) will try to bash whatever 'negative quality' ethereum has. First it's that transactions are too expensive (but no one mentioned how high chain revenue was a 'good thing'), now chain revenue is too low (but no one mentions how transaction fees are now very low and getting cheaper).\n\nSo while some of the value that drives price appreciation in ETH are related to the use of the blockchain and the fact that ETH is required to transact on Ethereum and its L2s, this is not as relevant or important as institutional and retail demand to accumulate the asset. All likely in anticipation to a wave of new developments coming along with more clear, open and well outlined regulation in the US, where most crypto companies and the capital that funds them still reside in (as with most industries).\n\nWith this new regulatory clarity, Ethereum is poised to become the most resilient, solid, secure, neutral, decentralised and uncensorable blockchain in the market. It is now in a unique position to capture enormous amounts of value from the financial sector, which now has green light to start building and deploying innovative products aimed at both institutions, retail investors and likely the average joe all over the world.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>One thing you&#39;ll see some people say in other communities and around the media to bash ETH is that the blockchain generates little revenue. However, when you consider the context in which this &#39;lack of revenue&#39; occurs, it becomes largely irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>At some point Ethereum was the highest revenue chain of all, by FAR, however, this was a result of there being a lot of demand for blockspace, but just not enough supply. Hence why there was constant criticism of its high fees. Now, given the upgrades introduced to the blockchain in the past 2 years (2024 and 2025), plus the existence of L2s, Ethereum has become a lot more scalable and therefore with the growing demand for blockspace, it can now accomodate a lot more transactions.</p>\n\n<p>This has resulted in a sharp drop in &#39;chain revenue&#39;, meaning there&#39;s a lot less fees being collected. However, we must note that had these upgrades not come, even if revenue was &#39;higher&#39;, the chain would be prohibitively expensive to use.</p>\n\n<p>So while all the comments replying to you are extremely well explained, I also think this detail is very important to point out, given that social media and crypto media sites (which all offer contradicting views) will try to bash whatever &#39;negative quality&#39; ethereum has. First it&#39;s that transactions are too expensive (but no one mentioned how high chain revenue was a &#39;good thing&#39;), now chain revenue is too low (but no one mentions how transaction fees are now very low and getting cheaper).</p>\n\n<p>So while some of the value that drives price appreciation in ETH are related to the use of the blockchain and the fact that ETH is required to transact on Ethereum and its L2s, this is not as relevant or important as institutional and retail demand to accumulate the asset. All likely in anticipation to a wave of new developments coming along with more clear, open and well outlined regulation in the US, where most crypto companies and the capital that funds them still reside in (as with most industries).</p>\n\n<p>With this new regulatory clarity, Ethereum is poised to become the most resilient, solid, secure, neutral, decentralised and uncensorable blockchain in the market. It is now in a unique position to capture enormous amounts of value from the financial sector, which now has green light to start building and deploying innovative products aimed at both institutions, retail investors and likely the average joe all over the world.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-07-28 11:30:15","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-07-28 11:36:04","id":"n5la2zw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mb7f6p","parent_id":"t1_n5l013q","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/IDGAFOS","body":"Scarcity, fees/yield, utility, network security.
