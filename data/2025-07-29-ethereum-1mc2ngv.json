We are in the third week of the trial which is now expected to wrap up this week. The prosecution has finished making its case and it is now the defense's turn. We'll then have closing statements from both sides, followed by a verdict. (There's still ongoing debate on the exact instructions the jury should receive)\n\nIf you want to read detailed summaries of what happened every day, read them [here on The Rage](https://www.therage.co/tag/tornado-cash/), it's quite interesting to read through. I'll share the tidbits that were most interesting to me.\n\n___\n\n**Prosecution case**\n\n> The prosecution attempted to paint a picture of Roman Storm as having deliberately built Tornado Cash to serve criminals. [...] To obtain a conviction, the Government has to prove mens rea: that Storm was of a guilty mind while developing Tornado Cash.\n\nLast Wednesday, we had an interesting witness presented by the prosecution - Shakeed Ahmed. This is a convicted criminal who is serving a 36 month sentence and is hoping for a reduction of said sentence in exchange for his testimony (!). (_How is this not incentivizing false testimony?_)\n\n> Ahmed testified that he used Tornado Cash to anonymize funds for a fee that he used to execute a price-manipulation attack against Crema \u2013 but that he did not use the service at all in laundering the roughly $15 million in proceeds from those crimes, or use Tornado Cash in any way in the Nirvana exploit.\n\nSo a bit of good, a bit of bad. You might be asking yourself \u2013 why even bring this witness if they barely used Tornado Cash? It was to help \"establish venue\":\n\n> [Ahmed] used Tornado Cash from his Manhattan apartment, providing another bit of standing for holding the trial in the SDNY.\n\nOn the same day, blockchain analyst Philip Werlau of Anchain AI also testified. His main role for the prosecution was to describe various ways how Tornado Cash could have stopped hackers from using it for crime. He admitted the original smart contracts couldn't have been altered, but also proposed this kind of solution:\n\n> Tornado Cash would use an account-based login system for the front-end, which would collect identifying information in an off-chain database in exchange for whitelisting a wallet for participation in mixing. Then, both deposit and withdrawal addresses for the mixing itself \u201cwould be maintained privately off the blockchain.\u201d\n\nRight, as if anyone would use that kind of system for privacy...\n\n> The defense went on to grill Werlau over industry practices, asking whether he had used services like Signal or Metamask, and whether either required any personally identifiable information to sign up, which Werlau stated to not recall.\n\nOne last _insane_ thing that happened is [this exchange](https://xcancel.com/innercitypress/status/1948745680110891420) between AUSA Rehn and the judge (which was sealed afterwards):\n\n> AUSA Rehn: We've spoken with Tom Schmidt's lawyer John Bostick\n> Judge: Are you looking at possibly prosecuting everyone at DragonFly?\n> AUSA Rehn: Not everyone, but Schmidt and [?...?]\n\nTom Schmidt is an executive at Dragonfly, one of the investors in Tornado Cash. The DOJ is never allowed to speculate on prosecuting a third party in open court in front of the media - that directly violates DOJ policy which states:\n\n> in the absence of some significant justification, it is not appropriate to identify (either by name or unnecessarily specific description), or cause a defendant to identify, a party unless that party has been publicly charged with the misconduct at issue.\n\nGuess what \u2013 AUSA Rehn backtracked hard on that exchange yesterday:\n\n> Rehn: Following that conference, there has been inaccurate and misleading public reporting on the government's position concerning Dragonfly and certain of its executives. The government wants the record to be clear that it has not identified Dragonfly or any of its directors, officers, employees, or controlling investors as targets of its investigation.\n\n\n\n___\n\n**Defense case**\n\nWe have a bit of what appears to be witness intimidation by the government:\n\n> On Friday, the defense stated that one of the Chainalysis witnesses now plans on pleading the Fifth \u2013 meaning that the witness may refuse to testify to avoid self-incrimination. According to the defense, this decision was made after a phone call between Chainalysis and the Government. The defense has asked the court to inquire on the details of what was said, stating that it was \"deeply concerned,\" as the witnesses potential decision came \"out of the blue.\" Chainalysis counsel, Mr. DeFillippis, did not disclose to the defense what was discussed on the call after multiple inquiries, the defense alleges.\n\nPreston van Loon (ETH core dev working at Offchain Labs (Prysm)) took the stand as a witness, providing some evidence that Tornado Cash did indeed have people using it for legitimate reasons:\n\n> Van Loon said he used the privacy protocol to limit the amount of publicly available financial information about him, because malicious actors could target him based on the on-chain assets he has access to. \n\nThe story of the IRS Agent that used some kind of LIFO method to trace funds may continue:\n\n> The defense may additionally call an already disclosed witness to rebut tracing done by IRS Special Agent George of the Government's first witness' funds Hanfeng \"Katie\" Lin, which, quite frankly, appears to have been an absolute dumpsterfire.\n\n___\n\nThe good:\n\n- The defense has imo poked some holes in the prosecution's case, and at least to me, some of their expert witness' competence on a technical level. The Rage reports: \"[Both defense attorneys] have consistently delivered incisive cross-examinations so far.\"\n- The defense is now free to make its case, I'm hopeful they can present some good evidence and poke further holes in the government's case.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n- The fact the team actually profited from Tornado Cash (through its governance token) makes things look worse.\n- Multiple people have reported the jury looks bored. These are normal people, with no good graps of the tech behind Tornado Cash who have been listening to highly technical mumbo-jumbo for two weeks \u2013 no wonder they're bored,.\n\n___\n\nIf you are in a position to support reporting on this case, I would again ask you to support [The Rage](https://www.therage.co/) who have honestly been the best source of information on this trial.
