How much does the market cap or price of an asset move in response to $1 of buy pressure. When I've seen studies of this number from the 2017 bull market, the 2018 ICO cash out crash, and the 2020 Covid black swan the price elasticity of ETH was in the 7-8 range. However this number is not a constant over time and it is difficult to measure. As you get into the slow recovery of the speculation curve it's lower and as you get the shooting star at the end of market cycles it's higher.\n\nWhere are we now? Well we know that there's been about 3M ETH purchased in the last month between ETFs and the treasury companies. Yes some of that has been OTC from the EF and others but nonetheless it's a lot of ETH. For simplicity let's say the average buy price was around $3k. That gives you cash inflows of about $9B. In that time the price has gone from $2500 to $3800. At 120M supply that is a market cap increase of $156B. This indicates a price elasticity of about 17.\n\nNow the treasury companies are indicating they are planning to acquire about 12M more ETH. At $3800 ETH that would require another $45B of inflows. At a similar price elasticity to the last month (17) that would increase the market cap by $765B or $6375 per ETH to a total price of just over $10k.\n\nHowever, the actual inflows will not all be at current prices so the total inflows will need to be a lot more than $45B and the price elasticity is going to go up as liquidity dries up. That means the total inflows may be closer to $100B and the price elasticity will probably be over 25 which will clearly put us over $20k ETH. To be clear **that would be bullish**.\n\nHere's another fun thought exercise about this. Let's say the price elasticity of ETH is 10 and the ETH treasury companies control 10% of the supply. If they can keep their mNav >1 then for each $1 they raise by selling shares, they buy $1 of ETH which increases the market cap of ETH $10, which increases the value of their holdings by $1 which again keeps their mNav >1 so they can just issue another share. There is essentially a flywheel of buy pressure when the treasury companies hit a critical mass of ETH such that (treasury percent)*elasticity>1. This cycle will continue until enough ETH has been shaken from the hands of hodlers (you) to offset all the inflows this flywheel creates.\n\nYou might want to get strapped in because the shaking they are going to do to try to pry the ETH loose from you is going to cause some wicked volatility on the way up.

I also attend the weekly dev-calls and help with organising them.\n\n## Things I like:\n\n### Core Developer Culture \nFrequent updates, good crisis managment, some really really smart people in there. My team started working with rust and substrate in 2019 and abandoned it for EVM back then and now we are coming back to it because of Bittensor - working with rust and substrate is HARD - the core devs are GOOD.\n\n### Decentralization Maximalism\nThe foundation is straight up not incentivizing anything like adoption, CEX Listings or similar, no nepotism - \"Binance will list us when they list us\"\n\n### Narrative\nIts more useful than bitcoin. I like the \"proof of useful work\" narrative.\n\n### Impressive Subnets\nI use Chutes daily for instance (rayonlabs) - I like the idea of competition driving\u00a0miners to improve. There are other nice ones like what Macrocosmos or Tensorplex are doing - you can find pretty interesting stuff.\n\n---\n\n## What makes me cautious:\n\n### Economic Design\nIts very hard to say how the whole scheme works out economically they are straight up experimenting and \"see what happens\" I could not tell if the Price of TAO goes x10 or /10 - the whole thing with alpha tokens and that emissions for subnets are based on the size of the tokenpools is... lets call it \"Interesting\". I would never ever advise or tell anyone to invest - its a huge experiment at best and a broken design at worst (see logris' post)\n\n### Scam Subnets\nAnyone can buy a subnet slot - there are 128 of them right now and its almost impossible for newbies to find out which ones are legit or useful (apart from the big ones maybe) there have been many instances of problematic behaviors. Subnet miners and validator design is completely up to the teams and since emissions purely based on the size of the alpha token pool its says absolutely nothing about quality. For every subnet its \"scam until\u00a0proven otherwise\"\n\n---\n\nRight now it seems people are betting on the halving mechanic to have a similar effect like on Bitcoin mainly. Overall it has more potential than Bitcoin. But I am still an EVM maximalist. I am very very cautious with putting money in there and think it would be wise to wait a few years to see how its developing or just parking TAO staked in root and forget about it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hardcore EVM Maxi here, Ethereum is my church.</p>\n\n<p>For work reasons I am pretty deep in the Bittensor Ecosystem - I work on multiple projects ranging from launching custom subnets with people, trying to get traction to Bittensor EVM all the way to agentic/meme projects. I also attend the weekly dev-calls and help with organising them.</p>\n\n<h2>Things I like:</h2>\n\n<h3>Core Developer Culture</h3>\n\n<p>Frequent updates, good crisis managment, some really really smart people in there. My team started working with rust and substrate in 2019 and abandoned it for EVM back then and now we are coming back to it because of Bittensor - working with rust and substrate is HARD - the core devs are GOOD.</p>\n\n<h3>Decentralization Maximalism</h3>\n\n<p>The foundation is straight up not incentivizing anything like adoption, CEX Listings or similar, no nepotism - &quot;Binance will list us when they list us&quot;</p>\n\n<h3>Narrative</h3>\n\n<p>Its more useful than bitcoin. I like the &quot;proof of useful work&quot; narrative.</p>\n\n<h3>Impressive Subnets</h3>\n\n<p>I use Chutes daily for instance (rayonlabs) - I like the idea of competition driving\u00a0miners to improve. There are other nice ones like what Macrocosmos or Tensorplex are doing - you can find pretty interesting stuff.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>What makes me cautious:</h2>\n\n<h3>Economic Design</h3>\n\n<p>Its very hard to say how the whole scheme works out economically they are straight up experimenting and &quot;see what happens&quot; I could not tell if the Price of TAO goes x10 or /10 - the whole thing with alpha tokens and that emissions for subnets are based on the size of the tokenpools is... lets call it &quot;Interesting&quot;. I would never ever advise or tell anyone to invest - its a huge experiment at best and a broken design at worst (see logris&#39; post)</p>\n\n<h3>Scam Subnets</h3>\n\n<p>Anyone can buy a subnet slot - there are 128 of them right now and its almost impossible for newbies to find out which ones are legit or useful (apart from the big ones maybe) there have been many instances of problematic behaviors. Subnet miners and validator design is completely up to the teams and since emissions purely based on the size of the alpha token pool its says absolutely nothing about quality. For every subnet its &quot;scam until\u00a0proven otherwise&quot;</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Right now it seems people are betting on the halving mechanic to have a similar effect like on Bitcoin mainly. Overall it has more potential than Bitcoin. But I am still an EVM maximalist. I am very very cautious with putting money in there and think it would be wise to wait a few years to see how its developing or just parking TAO staked in root and forget about it.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-07 21:32:32","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-08-07 22:55:07","id":"n7hqpax","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mjr5q6","parent_id":"t1_n7hg5wd","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Flashy-Butterfly6310","body":"Thank you so much for your answer!\nI feel your curiosity about this technology but I also notice your reserve.
