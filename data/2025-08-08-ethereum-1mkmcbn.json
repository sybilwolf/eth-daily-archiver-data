The next upgrade called Fusaka, might go live in November and includes PeerDAS which allows massively more blobs for rollups to scale even more. \nThe drama comes now, after a months long open debate and input from the community and the consensus was that ePBS is the optimal, but not perfect, solution. But some people are a bit unhappy and now try to change that decision through being loud on twitter. It worked the last time when an upgrade, got scraped pretty late in the development. But now some loud voiuces try to change the decision such that another upgrade can be implemented, which overall has similar issues like ePBS and is less well understood. Lets see how it plays out.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-08 19:23:38","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n7nkn5b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mkmcbn","parent_id":"t1_n7mzj8x","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ImNoRatAndYouKnowIt","body":"Wow, thanks for the incredibly thorough response!
