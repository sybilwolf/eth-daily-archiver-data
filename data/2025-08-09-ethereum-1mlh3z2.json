And quite importantly because Ethereum has slashing and correlation penalties it makes the attacks extremely expensive for the attacker to the point that they are more self-harming than able to harm the network. \n\nAt 33% stake  you can prevent the network from finalizing. Finalization is a property of Ethereum that sets the blocks in stone, irreversible, once 2/3 of the stake has attested them as valid. If an attacker has more than 1/3 of the stake then they can prevent finalization by not attesting. The problem they will face is that the network immediately starts penalizing non-attesting validators and they start losing ETH. This process starts gently but gets extremely aggressive as time goes on. Eventually the attacker has lost enough stake that the network finalizes again. Ethereum is designed to be self-healing. Furthermore, PoW networks do not have finality either. So under these circumstances Ethereum simply falls back to the similar finality assumptions as Bitcoin. The longer you wait the more likely is for a transaction to not revert. \n\nAt 50% of stake you can censor transactions and you can try to do double spends. Emphasis on try. Because you will get slashed. And the correlation penalties get extremely hard at those levels of stake. As an attacker you face almost complete capital loss. As for censoring, you face the same issue as above with non-attestation the inactivity leak and correlation penalties get quite harsh. \n\nAt 66% of stake is where things do actually get ugly. At 66% the attacker can finalize the chain on its own so they can completely censor, they can punish the minority by not recognizing their block proposals.

And quite importantly because Ethereum has slashing and correlation penalties it makes the attacks extremely expensive for the attacker to the point that they are more self-harming than able to harm the network. </p>\n\n<p>At 33% stake  you can prevent the network from finalizing. Finalization is a property of Ethereum that sets the blocks in stone, irreversible, once 2/3 of the stake has attested them as valid. If an attacker has more than 1/3 of the stake then they can prevent finalization by not attesting. The problem they will face is that the network immediately starts penalizing non-attesting validators and they start losing ETH. This process starts gently but gets extremely aggressive as time goes on. Eventually the attacker has lost enough stake that the network finalizes again. Ethereum is designed to be self-healing. Furthermore, PoW networks do not have finality either. So under these circumstances Ethereum simply falls back to the similar finality assumptions as Bitcoin. The longer you wait the more likely is for a transaction to not revert. </p>\n\n<p>At 50% of stake you can censor transactions and you can try to do double spends. Emphasis on try. Because you will get slashed. And the correlation penalties get extremely hard at those levels of stake. As an attacker you face almost complete capital loss.

If we actually did scale the L1 100x in the next 2 years, fees on mainnet would go down to practically nothing. </p>\n\n<p>Scaling the L1 does the opposite of increasing fees/burn if it isn&#39;t met with even higher increases in demand. And at least for now, there&#39;s no sign of that happening. People here tend to massively overestimate growth in block-/blobspace demand, based on faith and hopium, I suppose. That growth in reality is actually <strong>very slow</strong> and with the current scaling efforts it&#39;s absolutely dwarfed by the increases in capacity that have already happened and will continue to come.</p>\n\n<p>edit: Also, just to be clear: I think scaling is great, we should scale this thing to the tits. If this is going to be the &quot;world computer&quot;, it needs to scale very high. But that is separate from having a sensible fee model, the main purpose of which is to disincentivize spam. The current model just means fees go to nothing (1 Wei) when capacity outweighs demand, which just invites spam that is indistinguishable from actual growth. And it also happens to reduce the burn to nothing, which works against one of ETH&#39;s easiest to sell value propositions.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-09 07:47:54","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-08-09 08:36:32","id":"n7qruec","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mlh3z2","parent_id":"t1_n7qozim","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/benido2030","body":"I guess you know this but I still want to state it explicitly: \n\nIf we 10x/ 100x the ultra sound barrier goes down to 10%/ 1% of today\u2019s gas. \n\nAnd then we aren\u2019t even talking about blobs, but to be fair I expect blob scaling to be faster than blob demand for the next 2 years at least, 5 years is imo very hard or even impossible to tell. \n\nBut just the avg gas per block increase led to a change from 20+ gwei to 16.5 gwei according to usm.
