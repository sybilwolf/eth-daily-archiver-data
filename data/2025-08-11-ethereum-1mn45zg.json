I&#39;ve also seen him on core devs calls.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, this \u201cintern\u201d has a strong network of contacts and lawyers, so the latest news is that he should be released this morning and be able to fight this from outside a jail cell.</p>\n\n<p>Too early to say more, but I wanted to share it here just in case. Who knows \u2014 maybe we have some high-ranking Turkish official lurking who likes updooting the diddly and can help.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: So, thankfully, <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/fede_intern/status/1954945403146625291\">he was indeed released from jail earlier today</a>. I&#39;m not sure they would have just let anyone go though, he made a big fuss and probably managed to reach people on high places through his network of contacts.</p>\n\n<p>Based on his Twitter post, it looks like his arrest may have something to do with Tornado Cash?!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Minister of Internal Affairs had filed a case accusing me of helping others misuse @ethereum, allegedly in connection with a privacy protocol. [...] what they formally told my lawyer is that we helped people use ethereum for illegal activity. they also mention to me that we helped people use a \u201cprivate\u201d protocol.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He (or his team) never directly worked on Tornado Cash, they published an academic paper with some code that showed it was possible to deanonymize users.</p>\n\n<p>Wtf is going on here? Will they arrest <em>me</em> next for having reported on the trial here at <a href=\"/r/ethereum\">r/ethereum</a> ?</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 09:35:25","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-08-11 20:15:35","id":"n830b1b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t3_1mn45zg","score":32,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Eshat19","body":"Imagine waiting all these years just to sell at break-even.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Imagine waiting all these years just to sell at break-even.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 11:43:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n83fck2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t3_1mn45zg","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Gumba_Hasselhoff","body":"Imagine selling fundamentally solid assets outside of peak hysteria","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Imagine selling fundamentally solid assets outside of peak hysteria</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 11:49:18","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n83g3jw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t1_n83fck2","score":11,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/rhythm_of_eth","body":"Feels weird but I'm not in the mindset of parting with my ETH because I honestly just like the tech.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Feels weird but I&#39;m not in the mindset of parting with my ETH because I honestly just like the tech.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 11:51:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n83gdkm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t1_n83g3jw","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/cryptojimmy8","body":"If this is one\u2019s break even price then crypto maybe isnt for them","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>If this is one\u2019s break even price then crypto maybe isnt for them</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 13:00:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n83r249","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t1_n83fck2","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/cryptojimmy8","body":"It was more fun earlier today","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>It was more fun earlier today</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 11:53:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n83go0g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t3_1mn45zg","score":15,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/M4gelock","body":"How about now","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>How about now</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 16:15:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n84sqyd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t1_n83go0g","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/cryptojimmy8","body":"Now it\u2019s fun again\ud83d\ude02","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Now it\u2019s fun again\ud83d\ude02</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 16:16:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n84stt1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t1_n84sqyd","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/physalisx","body":"that's the way she goes","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>that&#39;s the way she goes</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 12:45:37","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n83omjo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t1_n83go0g","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/rhythm_of_eth","body":"Ratio and ETH are both green again. \n\nEveryone can go back to their daily lives, it was just a minor glitch.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ratio and ETH are both green again. </p>\n\n<p>Everyone can go back to their daily lives, it was just a minor glitch.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 14:37:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n848sou","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t3_1mn45zg","score":16,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/aur3l1us","body":"$4,500 today, let\u2019s keep climbing these stairs, folks.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$4,500 today, let\u2019s keep climbing these stairs, folks.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 05:05:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n828ias","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t3_1mn45zg","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/hblask","body":"I'll take \"posts that didn't age well\" for $300.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ll take &quot;posts that didn&#39;t age well&quot; for $300.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-11 12:48:48","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n83p52c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mn45zg","parent_id":"t1_n828ias","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Numerous_Ruin_4947","body":"Hopefully!
