Let me be clear, it's a blatant lie. One more of many other SOLies.\n\nHere is what happened. There was 1 block, a single block. That had 43K \"transactions\". Solana has a block cadence of around 400ms. So they extrapolate that to around 100K transactions per second. This is obviously completely unrealistic, to calculate a speed in any process that is discretized (transactions come in discrete chunks with each block) you need to take some moving average. They decided to skip that and just extrapolate a tps number from it.\n\nAnother issue in their reporting is what constitutes a transaction. In Solalaland this includes basic house keeping of the chain that has no relation to user transactions. Things like consensus votes (\"VoteProgram\") are famously included to juice up the numbers. This is purely internal house keeping of the chain, it's the miminal internal functioning that is needed to maintian the chain alive. If Ethereum included the equivalent consensus votes in its tps figures it would systematically be doing 3K-4K tps. \n\nBut even beyond that, this block specifically was simply fabricated (https://solscan.io/block/360650523), they filled it up with a special program called No-Op (https://solscan.io/account/noopXHpJChmCfa1JpS69Y3AesNc27mz3b2JsxwizYCX) that does nothing, absolutely nothing.
