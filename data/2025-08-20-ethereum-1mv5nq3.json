I'm glad the daily is more vibrant than ethfinance was after the API changes killed off a lot of the old guard (plus the shedding from the bear, hacks, life in general... RIP JBM, I hope you tamed those demons my dude) but I'm a bit disappointed by how little signal there is in the sub now. I learned about reputable DeFi protocols like Pendle/Morpho from the dailies and through the years have managed to grow my stack significantly. Specifically will like to call out /u/LogrisTheBard (hopefully this tags so he can see lol) since Pendle during the points meta made me a killing. But anyways here's a few protocols and resources I'd recommend for any DeFi newbies and hopefully it will help you build conviction in this glorious asset we call ETH just as it strengthened mine throughout the years. I'll avoid direct links since I'm not sure what's allowed or not but as long as you've got an ad blocker (you do use an ad blocker, right anon?) googling/using the general knowledge resources should get you to the right place. Remember to bookmark the protocols you use regularly as well to avoid misclicks. Also my personal suggestion is don't pirate shit / go to lots of porn sites (horny brain dumb) on the same computer your hot wallet is on. \n\nGeneral knowledge: \nDefiLlama- gives you a basic overview of protocols, TVL, links to their websites/socials. You can filter the protocols by chain as well so if you know only want something on mainnet/base/arbitrum etc you won't waste anytime. I take TVL as a general measure of trustworthiness and personally anything below $100M TVL I won't touch. \nExponentialFi - for the true newbie I'd probably start here. The free education (learn and explore tabs) they have is really good if you have no idea what you're doing. Explaining how DeFi yield works, giving their own assessments of risks and protocol credibility, all things I found quite helpful starting out. Their primary goal is to get you to sign up for their service where they will manage your on-chain funds, but I can't speak about the quality of the service as I've never utilized it. I think its legit though, maybe another member here that's used them can chime in.\n\nSwaps: CoW swap -- stands for coincidence of wants, charges no fees, generally eeks out a little extra return compared to others and most importantly, moos at you when it finds a match. Much love and highly recommended. IMO no reason to use any other service for swaps. \n\nLending:\nAave - it's the big kahoona, you all know it. Battle tried and tested, gone through multiple bears unscathed. You want DeFi at it's safest this is the place. Check out the Umbrella or staking (insurance for AAVE) for what I'd consider the best risk/reward rate possible. \nMorpho - A competitor to AAVE that initially differentiated themselves by offering slightly better rates by matching users. I think either they or Gearbox were the first to utilize vaults but I'd say vaults are the primary draw these days. You put assets to a vault and the curator splits it among protocols to generate yield. Higher risk than AAVE but not particularly dangerous (IIRC most vaults are around an up to 2% chance yearly to lose up to ~10% of assets). Read the risk reports under the vault for the methodology and explanation. But stick with the whitelisted vaults and you should be chill.\nPendle - big breakthrough here was in offering fixed rates and splitting yield. During points mania PT (principle token) Eth derivatives just printed money. I think I was getting ~40% APY at one point. Those days are past us but being able to lock in a fixed rate is still worthwhile. Just be mindful that its locked and trying to redeem early can cause significant loss. An example is when the redemption rates suddenly changed for USD0++ (from 1:1 to 1:0.85 IIRC) and people that were holding PT got hammered.  \n\nNow to a protocol I've been researching and I hope some other experienced members can chime in on -- Summer fi recently launched their lazy summer protocol (TVL ~120M, combined total of ~$450M) which is an aggregator built on top of Morpho/Euler/Gearbox vaults that automatically redistributes according to rates. The onboarding process appeared suspiciously easy, +a mix of AI buzzwords and dedicated support agents gave me a great deal of pause initially, but further research has me convinced its not a scam/honeypot. Note this is still significantly higher risk than say Morpho alone, as summer is built on top of other protocols and vaults so you're taking on protocol, vault and asset risk. Yield is highly attractive despite the 1% management fee as they will be launching their token soon (I recommend dropping the marketcap assumption for SUMR down to at most $100M from their assumption of $250M... Morpho is about 8 times larger at $4B TVL protocol and token is only ~$700M mcap). The automated reallocating is nice if you are frequently swapping in and out of vaults chasing yield (similar to Beefy finance for LPs). Logris if you've already desposited into the protocol dm me your referral code (or if mods allow post below so others use it too) as I'm happy to give you a little extra yield as a thank you for all the opportunities you've shared over the years. \n\nAnyways, if you've made it this far thanks for reading and feel free to tell me how I got all this wrong lol Going back to lurking now.

The Ethereum ecosystem, does 15-20% of all stablecoin transactions.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned by the other poster the volume numbers are even less impressive for Solana. Solana does 11% of the USDC Volume, whereas Ethereum alone does 70%. Together with rollups this goes up to above 80%. If you include all stablecoins, Solana does 5% of all Volume, Tron 35% and Ethereum 42%.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-21 06:16:40","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n9uks41","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mv5nq3","parent_id":"t1_n9ss92g","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Itur_ad_Astra","body":"**ALL HAIL THE ETERNAL CRAB**\n\n**BULL RETREAT EDITION**\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83c\udf0a      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83d\udcc9      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udcc9      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02\n\n\u26a1      \ud83d\udcc9      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udc0b      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udcc9      \u26a1\n\n\ud83c\udf0a      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udc0b      \ud83e\udd80      \ud83d\udc0b      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83c\udf0a\n\n\u26a1      \ud83d\udcc9      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udc0b      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udcc9      \u26a1\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83d\udcc9      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udcc9      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83c\udf0a      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02\n\n**$1000------------$4288----$5000**\n\n**2021----------2025----------\u221e**\n\n*The past few days were, without a doubt, very crabby.*\n\n*Volatility, the blood of the Eternal Crab.*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>ALL HAIL THE ETERNAL CRAB</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>BULL RETREAT EDITION</strong></p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83c\udf0a      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83d\udcc9      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udcc9      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02</p>\n\n<p>\u26a1      \ud83d\udcc9      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udc0b      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udcc9      \u26a1</p>\n\n<p>\ud83c\udf0a      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udc0b      \ud83e\udd80      \ud83d\udc0b      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83c\udf0a</p>\n\n<p>\u26a1      \ud83d\udcc9      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udc0b      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udcc9      \u26a1</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83d\udcc9      \ud83d\udcc8      \ud83d\udcc9      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83c\udf0a      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02</p>\n\n<p><strong>$1000------------$4288----$5000</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2021----------2025----------\u221e</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>The past few days were, without a doubt, very crabby.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Volatility, the blood of the Eternal Crab.</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-20 19:06:34","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"n9rh2us","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mv5nq3","parent_id":"t3_1mv5nq3","score":18,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Love_Arzt","body":"That dip got bought extremely hard.
