Productivity technologies can either raise the standard of living of society or they can just create labor market imbalances that increase wealth inequality. Which is the more likely outcome for this productivity technology?\n\nWell, that depends.\n\n1) Is AI likely to create new jobs as fast as old jobs are being displaced?\n\n2) Are those jobs going to be at a higher or equivalent salary?\n\n3) Are the price of goods likely to fall due to productivity so we can buy more with the same salary?\n\nHistorically, production booms have been a double-edged sword. In the industrial revolution we lost a lot of horse care workers and farmer day laborers but it also created entirely new industries and occupations. Instead of swinging a scythe a laborer could be maintaining the combine wheat harvester. In other cases demand for work actually increased with productivity. The literal textbook example for me was textiles. As the cost of textiles fell, demand for textiles soared, leading to a net increase in weaving jobs despite automatic looms. A more recent example might be transistors or anything else that falls into [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox). However, I don't think most goods fall into this category and the industrial revolution was indisputably [bad for horses](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ge1dqj/horse_population_decreased_rapidly_from_20_mi_in/). I'm a bit worried people are going to be the horse in this situation.\n\nHolistically, we already see a clear trend of a shittier job market since the rise of LLMs and it seems to be accelerating. I see stories every day of companies mandating the use of AI. Where we see more of that trend we also see the worst job market impacts. For example software engineers are currently amongst the highest unemployed degrees. Why? Because it's a tech industry that is able to adopt AI faster so it's feeling the affects sooner than industries that lag on technology adoption.\n\nIn magnitude, the informatics jobs most ripe for AI displacement amount to over $3T a year. This impacts everything from education, to diagnostic roles in medicine, law firms, software engineering, customer service, art, and logistics. It affects both some of the highest paying occupations such as doctors as well as the most prolific occupations such as truck driver and teacher.\n\nCompare this with the magnitude of jobs it creates. Data labelers earn something akin to uber driver wages. Data scientists earn equivalent to software engineer wages but we won't have demand for 1/10th of them and increasingly AI will do this job too. Prompt engineers are something of a min wage job and this new skillset is responsible for a disturbing trend in AI slop. Even if we had strong educational and retraining systems in place (we don't) I don't know what we would retrain people to do.\n\nI think it's clear that this isn't a situation where more new jobs are going to be created or replaced by higher paying jobs (at least at the rate of displacement). Even if they would eventually I think we're in for a rough few decades because the advances and proliferation in the availability of AI are happening at a much faster pace than the industrial revolution which took place over 3-4 decades. What looks more likely to me is that $3T of salary is going to be gobbled up by tech oligopolies and the displaced people are going to be fighting in a labor market heavily biased against them. This technology is more often a substitute, rather than a complement to, existing labor. When a technology can perform a task that was previously done by humans for less cost and without the need for significant human oversight, it displaces workers. When these workers cannot easily transition to new roles at the rate of displacement then the supply of labor outstrips demand which increases unemployment and drives down wages.\n\nAddressing the third point: according to the economic textbooks I've read, capitalism (productivity) should be an inherently deflationary force. Competition should drive up productivity and drive down prices. In my lifetime, this is obviously not what I have seen.\n\nInstead what I see is that productivity goes up, potential output goes up, profit margins go up, the expectations for your role go up, but prices never fall. You might see a Wendy's 4 for 4 special for awhile but outside of temporary promotions, prices only ever go up. Why is that? Why don't productivity enhancements and cost savings translate into lower prices for consumers?\n\nI think there's a few factors at play here. First, technology advances don't proliferate across companies instantly. So if you *know* that your competitor isn't lowering their price, why lower yours? Just collect extra profit. Then when your competitor get a breakthrough, they apply the same reasoning to you.\n\nSecond, demand is surprisingly price inelastic on most goods. Whenever corporations determine that they can *justify* raising prices, they do, regardless of productivity. How high did McDonalds have to raise prices before they saw consumer backlash. From my recollection it was like 50% in 2 years. Chick-fil-A prices have risen by 21% over the past two years. That's way more than inflation. All the tariff stuff? Whether your costs actually went up or not, you can just blame it on tariffs and raise prices. So we see price gouging which is rather the opposite of what the textbooks predict.\n\nThird is that most of what we see on the store shelves is curated by something like Kroger or Walmart. In a perfectly competitive market, where there are many sellers and products are indistinguishable (like food commodities) we do see something closer to textbook behaviors. However, inside a given store you don't really have perfect choice and while they are similar Coke and Pepsi are not fungible. Practically speaking, most of the US is an oligopoly or monopoly under massive umbrella corporate structures. You want to boycott Nestle? [Good luck.](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/eaqja7/umbrella_companies/)\n\nI believe the more likely outcome with modern AI is an dramatic acceleration in wealth inequality, which is already at French revolution levels, in the next 5-10 years. Cutting social safety nets at this same time and running up the national debt isn't going to help matters.\n\nWhat should you do about this? I'm going to be [writing more](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/ai-endgame/) about how to develop personal and community AIs using the DeAI tech stack. My wife is forcing me write a book (which will be slow going). We need to prepare defensive applications of AI that can protect you from the biases and extractive interests of tech oligopolies. Specifically as it relates to job displacement the problem is that your knowledge is going to be encoded into AIs you have no ownership of and therefore you won't be compensated for it. DeAI can enable you to build an AI with your skillset that you can monetize and turn into a perpetual revenue stream. I'm offering you a personal lifeboat.
