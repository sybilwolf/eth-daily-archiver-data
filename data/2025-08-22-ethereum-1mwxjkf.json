But if it ever is that\u2019s a screaming buy signal to me.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-22 14:08:14","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"na2sksm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","parent_id":"t1_na2q4qz","score":9,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/SuspiciousConcern","body":"Ray hit 0.04!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ray hit 0.04!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-22 14:18:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"na2ukdq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","parent_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/mcmatt05","body":"$300 candle in the blink of an eye","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>$300 candle in the blink of an eye</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-22 14:23:44","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-08-22 14:28:57","id":"na2vl3u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","parent_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/SeaMonkey82","body":"[and that's just the appetizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qKKjJ8Uj0I&pp=ygUSanVzdCB0aGUgYXBwZXRpemVy)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qKKjJ8Uj0I&amp;pp=ygUSanVzdCB0aGUgYXBwZXRpemVy\">and that&#39;s just the appetizer</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-22 14:41:12","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"na2z0n8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","parent_id":"t1_na2vl3u","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/twobadkidsin412","body":"Seems like the technology has really improved!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Seems like the technology has really improved!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-22 14:34:03","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"na2xlyl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","parent_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/pta666","body":"Yes, the last minutes or so","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes, the last minutes or so</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-22 14:40:08","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"na2yt72","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","parent_id":"t1_na2xlyl","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/jan1919","body":"They keep shipping","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>They keep shipping</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-22 14:46:16","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"na300v9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1mwxjkf","parent_id":"t1_na2xlyl","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Logophi1e","body":"In my online class seeing my phone blow up with crypto price alerts on the sideline and knowing I had to wait to look at it felt so good.

You mean well. But when you create an EIP to solve the problem of \"filtering out transactions with sanctioned addresses\" and your solution is \"to allow validators to impose constraints on builders by force-including transactions in their blocks\"... we have a problem. A big problem. And if you don't see it, you're either being naive or reckless. \n\nSo far, the censorship resistance story on Ethereum has gone something like this:\n\n1) ETH staking is permissionless to join\n2) stakers can decide to include txns... so even if 99% of staking nodes censored tornado cash txns for example, it would just take 100x longer\n\nThis has worked out, in my opinion, more or less OK. \n\nEven at peak Tornado Cash censorship, only 90% of nodes were censoring TC txns, so txns should have taken 150s instead of 15s.\n\nThis setup allowed node operators in the US who could potentially face legal risk for interacting with and facilitating txns to the sanctioned addresses (up to 20 years in prison for a sanctions violation) to simply filter them out and continue participating in the Ethereum network.\n\nEven with the block builder oligopoly, only 2 out of 3 of the block builders are censoring, and as the OP mentioned, 90% of the rest of the validator set is NOT engaging in censorship.\n\nWhat FOCIL does is FORCE INCLUDE TRANSACTIONS FROM SANCTIONED ADDRESSES, such that VALIDATORS CAN NO LONGER CHOOSE TO FILTER THEM OUT.\n\nThis is potentially a big problem for US validators, who now could face legal penalties for staking. \n\nIt appears the \"plan\" is to attempt to limit the legal liability of the validator chosen for each block by distributing the responsibility of deciding on txn inclusion across a set of attesters (other validators who are not chosen for the block) such that each block's validator can claim \"well look, I didn't choose the txns in the blocks, I'm just validating them.\"\n\nI don't have great faith in this plan. \n\nThe US government could:\n\n1. Decide it doesn't care about the whole \"attester\" business and go after known validators who include sanctioned address txns in their blocks anyway. \n\n2. Decide to go after the known attesters who decided to include a sanctioned address txn in the block.\n\n3. Go after the core devs who designed a system to coerce the validators into including sanctioned address txns. \n\nIf you don't think they won't do #3, that's weird, because I didn't see you at either Alexey's or Roman's trial.\n\nIf I was the US gov, I would actually be 100% in favor of FOCIL. You mean to tell me the ETH validators are all going to be *forced* to incriminate themselves by validating blocks with sanctioned address txns? Well great, that means I can go after any ETH validator on US soil whenever I want, seize all their ETH, and prosecute them for a sanctions violation.\n\nAnd you're telling me the ETH core devs made their *intent* to coerce validators into violating sanctions publicly available on the ETH research forum? Amazing, now I can even round up any relevant ETH core devs that might pass through the US and prosecute them for conspiracy as well.\n\nIt also doesn't help that, while FOCIL is currently not designed to provide any incentives validators to include specific txns, instead relying on \"altruism\" (here, altruism means the willingness to include txns from sanctioned addresses, bc of course it does \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) this is also not the plan forever. \n \n\nCurrently, the plan is Option 1 - to simply rely on \"altruistic\" validators to attest to the sanctioned address txns, and not provide incentives to the attesters.\n\nBut I don't think the plan is for things to stay this way forever, as there is an active research effort into figuring out the best way to reward the attesters for their service.
