The Proof of Work is what ensures no entity can spawn a million sock puppet nodes and make invalid blocks.  \n\nTo provide an incentive to validate blocks, miners who solve the proof of work are given new bitcoin.  The amount of new bitcoin for miners halves every four years to keep bitcoin's supply scarce.  This is known as a halving.\n\nBecause bitcoin gets scarce each halving, you get a supply shock every 4 years, which is why you get bitcoin bubbles every four years.  The supply shock and reduction in supply is what causes bitcoin's price appreciation.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/iTYyF7Fk/\n\nHowever each reduction in new supply is less as a percentage of already existing supply.  And that decrease follows [an exponential curve](https://static.coingecko.com/s/bitcoin-supply-curve-ff819f2514c2e0bc694b404234e502096933c53c895a13d545074c5aa8e33dbf.png).  Accordingly, bitcoin's price increases decrease exponentially relative to the preceding cycle.\n\nIf you look at each cycle, the percentage gains decrease by one order of magnitude.  I'm not going to write it out so see this chart:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/lENnO6wn/\n\nThe pattern of percentage price increase from time of halving to top of cycle is X0,000%, X,000%, X00%, X0%.  This is imprecise.... but there are ways to measure it even more precisely, and moveover, this is part of the physical mechanism behind the cyclical pattern of bitcoin bubbles.\n\nThis is not to say halvings are the only thing which impacts bitcoin's price, obviously we made an ATH before the halving, so demand matters too.

The Proof of Work is what ensures no entity can spawn a million sock puppet nodes and make invalid blocks.  </p>\n\n<p>To provide an incentive to validate blocks, miners who solve the proof of work are given new bitcoin.  The amount of new bitcoin for miners halves every four years to keep bitcoin&#39;s supply scarce.  This is known as a halving.</p>\n\n<p>Because bitcoin gets scarce each halving, you get a supply shock every 4 years, which is why you get bitcoin bubbles every four years.  The supply shock and reduction in supply is what causes bitcoin&#39;s price appreciation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/iTYyF7Fk/\">https://www.tradingview.com/x/iTYyF7Fk/</a></p>\n\n<p>However each reduction in new supply is less as a percentage of already existing supply.  And that decrease follows <a href=\"https://static.coingecko.com/s/bitcoin-supply-curve-ff819f2514c2e0bc694b404234e502096933c53c895a13d545074c5aa8e33dbf.png\">an exponential curve</a>.  Accordingly, bitcoin&#39;s price increases decrease exponentially relative to the preceding cycle.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at each cycle, the percentage gains decrease by one order of magnitude.

Our results suggest that bitcoin blockchain security is highly sensitive to the reward system that incentivizes distributed network participants to provide validation and enforcement services by increasing their computer capacity. As the ARDL estimates showed, these services are highly responsive and adjust fast to internal bitcoin economics (i.e. to changes in the mining reward). This may pose problems, particularly in low-security equilibriums, when the mining reward value declines. In such a situation, the incentives or supplying security services decrease and may make the transactions executed on bitcoin blockchain vulnerable to potential attacks. Bitcoin security is sustainable only if the value of reward increases over time, particularly given that, by design of the bitcoin algorithm, the reward is halved approximately every 4 years (every 210,000 blocks). This is reinforced by the fact that innovations in computing technology may significantly reduce the cost of supplying computer power and thus might also undermine bitcoin strength against potential hostile attacks. Hence, in the medium run, the entire security concept of bitcoin may need to be redesigned to reduce as much as possible its vulnerability to proof-of work costs and cryptocurrency market outcomes.

Let the community write the front-end, but let WotC control the rules engine.
