This might not be the fastest or cheapest way in all cases, but in my understanding the canical bridges are the most secure ones, at least for the established projects. I very seldomly bridge back to Ethereum. Also there I try to use the canonical bridge except for optimistic rollups. I do not want to wait a week for my funds to arrive.</p></li>\n<li><p>I pretty much always use plain ETH to bridge. No allowances have to be set for ETH. The coins are directly sent to the contract in a single transaction and the bridging is then executed. Unfortunately, there are some L2s where ETH is not the principal token and therefore ETH behaves like an ERC-20 token on them. In these cases I go to the next point. </p></li>\n<li><p>If I have to bridge an ERC-20 token, I try to make sure to only set the allowance to the amount really needed in that bridging transaction.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-27 15:03:20","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nayjvvo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1n185o4","parent_id":"t1_naxvxtq","score":14,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ricutigaupicu","body":"Thanks!
