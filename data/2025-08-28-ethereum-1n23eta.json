Having said that, part of what I was trying to point out in my last comment is that 2020 into 2021 was also the &quot;money printer go brrr&quot; moment so MSTR buying wasn&#39;t the only factor fueling BTC.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-08-28 17:37:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nb64j6a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1n23eta","parent_id":"t1_nb4wzhr","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Itur_ad_Astra","body":"**ALL HAIL THE ETERNAL CRAB**\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc0b      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc0b      \ud83e\udd80      \ud83d\udc0b      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc0b      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \u26a1      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02\n\n\ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02      \ud83d\udc02\n\n**$1000--------------$4597--$5000**\n\n**2021----------2025----------\u221e**\n\n*Groundhog day?
