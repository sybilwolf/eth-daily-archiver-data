It was spearheaded by one of the original Ethereum founders (Charles), who nobody realized was such a problematic leader yet.\n\nBy 2021 it became very clear that Charles wasn't building Cardano's tech in a sane direction at a reasonable speed. He had nothing worthwhile to show for those three years - just some failed experiments that didn't seem to be learned from. Meanwhile, Ethereum researched and wrote practical code that eliminated many of Ethereum's disadvantages compared to Cardano. Even Ethereum's failed research (pow/pos hybrid finality gadget, execution sharding, plasma, raiden) helped inform new research efforts that achieved those same goals in more practical, elegant ways (beacon chain, L2, blob sharding).\n\nBy 2024-2025, Cardano still had nothing particularly interesting to show. Their R&D seems to have been one massive exercise in bikeshedding and power games, as the core identity of the chain, and the product-market fit, has been ignored. A pointless layer of governance has been added so that people can squabble over the chain's little real value. They had a chance to lean into what makes Cardano unique from all other blockchains - and there are plenty of cool design trade-offs that set it apart - but they instead decided to continue trying to compete with Ethereum to be a secure, uncompromising general-purpose public blockchain, which is a losing scenario at this point even if your chain's CEO isn't known for making poor decisions.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>No. They were quite relevant in 2018, but no longer.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, they had just launched with a brand new fresh take on smart contract design (utxo + haskell) that made some trade-offs to gain clear advantages over Ethereum for specific use cases. It was spearheaded by one of the original Ethereum founders (Charles), who nobody realized was such a problematic leader yet.</p>\n\n<p>By 2021 it became very clear that Charles wasn&#39;t building Cardano&#39;s tech in a sane direction at a reasonable speed. He had nothing worthwhile to show for those three years - just some failed experiments that didn&#39;t seem to be learned from. Meanwhile, Ethereum researched and wrote practical code that eliminated many of Ethereum&#39;s disadvantages compared to Cardano. Even Ethereum&#39;s failed research (pow/pos hybrid finality gadget, execution sharding, plasma, raiden) helped inform new research efforts that achieved those same goals in more practical, elegant ways (beacon chain, L2, blob sharding).</p>\n\n<p>By 2024-2025, Cardano still had nothing particularly interesting to show.
