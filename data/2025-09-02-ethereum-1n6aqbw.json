Lido therefore plans to introduce different tiers to their Curated operator set, who are all currently earning the same fee of 5% of total staking rewards. The new tier-based model will try to take into account how much each operator contributes to the broader staking space, and reward operators accordingly. The following tiers are proposed:\n\n- Standard Tier -> ~3.5%\n\n- Client Team Tier -> ~4.5%\n\n- Extra Effort Tier -> ~4% - (running diverse setups or based in underrepresented regions)\n\n> The proposed changes reflect the higher expectations of Node Operators participating in the Curated Module\n\n_Personally I\u2019ve always considered the expectations for the curated set were far too low, so this is nice to see._\n\n___\n**Staking Router V3**\n\nA big update to Lido's staking router is coming to enable, among others, validator consolidations.

It will be interesting to see how this evolves and gets implemented over the coming year or so.\n\nCredit where credit's due: Lido has been investing significantly into decentralizing and improving their operator set. Hundreds of thousands of ETH are currently staked via their Simple DVT module, operated by hundreds of different node operators including home stakers.
