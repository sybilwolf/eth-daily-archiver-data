A bunch of dumbasses paid too much for their stock. They were selling dollar bills for $2. Rationally they kept doing this trade for as long as there were takers for them. Now they have a box of dollar bills that people only want to pay 90 cents for so they&#39;re buying back the dollar stocks for 90 cents. Ideally the whole cycle will repeat and they can continue taking money from morons indefinitely, but if they&#39;ve run out of morons then they&#39;re still sitting on a nice profit.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-10 04:17:21","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-09-10 04:28:14","id":"nde3lsp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nca4g7","parent_id":"t1_nddp6ft","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Dreth","body":"hi i am a moron","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>hi i am a moron</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-10 04:39:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nde6j6h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nca4g7","parent_id":"t1_nde3lsp","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/edmundedgar","body":"Luckily you can still move yourself from the scammee side to the scammer side by buying the underpriced stocks.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Luckily you can still move yourself from the scammee side to the scammer side by buying the underpriced stocks.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-10 04:45:42","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nde78we","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nca4g7","parent_id":"t1_nde6j6h","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/Dreth","body":"hi i am no longer a moron","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>hi i am no longer a moron</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-10 04:47:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nde7iic","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nca4g7","parent_id":"t1_nde78we","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"I know, but the discount grew way more than you would have thought was possible before that happened.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I know, but the discount grew way more than you would have thought was possible before that happened.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-10 05:57:10","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"ndefn3s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nca4g7","parent_id":"t1_ndcxza4","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/LifeReboot___","body":"Real question, is converting a portion of my Ethereum into Solana a bad idea?
