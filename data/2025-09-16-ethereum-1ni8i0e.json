There's [new videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-IyeN0cQaM&ab_channel=GlobalMoneyTalk) with him somewhere several times a week. He's not saying anything new to anyone here but he's saying it *over and over and over* anywhere he is given a microphone.\n\nThe basic message is simple:\n\n1) Wall Street is now aggressively building on Ethereum. This is happening right now because of recent legislation. ChatGPT moment etc, induce FOMO.\n\n2) ETH invariably will rise in price with this adoption. ETH can't stay at $4k if we get $4T in stablecoins on Ethereum. Call to authority of Scott Bessent and Larry Fink and respected names to basically say this isn't just his opinion. It's a logical fallacy and he doesn't justify why it has to go up in price with adoption or at what ratio he just argues past the post that ETH is going to go up and here's some historical data on the price rise of ETH.\n\n3) A treasury company grows your ETH per share compared to an ETF. Ethereum is a productive asset: Staking, Defi, etc. As one of the largest holders of ETH the treasury company can be a kingmaker of quality protocols on Ethereum and simultaneously promote their adoption and profit from their growth. He then just calls back to Microstrategy going up more in price than Bitcoin and Bitminer growing its ETH per share since June/July to justify buying BMNR instead of an ETF or ETH. He doesn't address why you couldn't just get this yield yourself like some people here and I do, he just assumes people listening to him won't so let him do it for you.\n\nHis argument style isn't nearly as thorough as I've seen from quality comments here over the years from people like DC. His arguments are full of logical fallacies maxis will poke holes in but that doesn't matter because the people watching these podcasts and broadcast television aren't going to hear their rebuttals and he's just echoing this argument week after week memeing it into existence.\n\nImportant note on style: he isn't divisive about how he presents his case. He isn't attacking Bitcoin or people who dislike crypto. He doesn't contradict anyone directly. He doesn't criticize people who don't agree with him. He just calmly states a few cherry picked facts to justify his arguments/positions without ever stating someone else is wrong even if he's directly asked. His demeanor isn't a stereotypical maxi. He doesn't seem overly excited or like a wall street bets degenerate. He's just a somewhat boring guy in a suit with some disheveled hair who sounds calm and well prepared with facts to defend his case and he gets that done whether he has 2 minutes or an hour. He isn't going to bother debating a Solana maxi; he's never going to get on the stage with them in the first place because it's counter productive. He just advertises his message again and again wherever someone will platform him. The less crypto the stage, the better.\n\nFrankly where the fuck have our advocates been the last 4 years? It's so sad the EF or ETH community couldn't crowdfund someone to do this in 2020-2021. Why did the EF have to lose Danny Ryan before we could get some organized materials [like this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JMu1pXfNEij2j8P2bSrRI9OQ_oGQG22E/view?pli=1) or [this](https://ethdigitaloil.com/). I love the tech. I'm a user of the chain and profit greatly from it financially. I advocate others to explore it and have written intro materials for anyone curious enough to try. However, I'm not willing or able to travel around the world to get on stage in New York and frankly my argument style is too focused on unassailable truths rather than brevity for broadcast television.

On the one hand, price probably go up. On the other hand, this is likely only going to accelerate late-stage capitalism and wealth inequality further. Capitalism, in its early days was probably a step up from the cruel king who sent a bunch of thugs to steal everything you made every year for the privilege of letting you live on his land but somewhere in the last 50 years or so it has distorted itself from a system of distribution to one that prioritizes its own growth, no matter how illogical or destructive, at the expense of every sane thing we came together as a society for and now we're stuck living in its bizarre hellscape. We now glorify the acquisition of wealth rather than the positive impacts that wealth is used for. Late stage capitalism sounds like an obscure medical condition you\u2019d hear about on a pharmaceutical commercial, where the side effects are a deep, existential dread and an uncontrollable urge to buy things you don't need but it's the horrifying, surreal, and deeply stupid reality we're building day by day.\n\nDuring the cypherpunk days there was a clear philosophical movement of building technologies that would remove intermediaries and enable p2p transactions. The dream was to minimize value extraction and enable people to directly discover and transact with one another so rather than building up a new set of kings we would remove them all together. The next wave in 2017 clearly had elements of extracting value on a product by product level to finance the creation of those platforms. This is essentially proposing we create numerous smaller kings rather than a few big ones. Still probably a step forward but not as idealistic. By 2021 with the NFT grifts and memecoins it felt like we had shed most of the philosophical underpinnings of cypherpunk ideology entirely.\n\nNow, with the general failure of Defi to win retail adoption in the last 5 years and with retail either needing institutions to handhold onboarding or even go so far as to take and deploy their capital to the blockchain without their consent, it feels like we're heading to a world where we not only fail to overturn the existing kings but one where we enshrine them even more deeply. Where there could have been a gig economy with freedom and flexibility that empowered people to help others whenever they had the will and capability instead we'll have a system where we're all just tiny, precarious contractors for giant corporations. You\u2019re not a driver for Uber; you're a \"driver partner.\" Which is like saying a serf was a \"land partner\" with the king. It's a semantic trick to strip away benefits and job security and pretend it's a perk. And that's if Waymo doesn't just win with driverless taxis first.\n\nIn 10 years the biggest result of Defi may just be the over-financialization of everything. The real work of building things, making things, or providing services will be irrelevant to the pathway to success and financial security in the world. The real money will be in moving money around, in abstract, complicated ways that no one actually understands. In the same way as the US housing market, everything will become more expensive, using buy-now-pay-later schemes and you might only own most of your stuff in the same sense as a house that is deeply mortgaged or a taxi you're currently riding in. The goal of companies in the future will increasingly be not to make products but to make numbers on a spreadsheet go up in an elaborate and global game of \"Mousetrap\" where the mouse is retirement and sovereign wealth funds. Why build a factory when stock buybacks get you those sweet CEO bonuses this quarter?\n\nI had hoped for a better world than one where residents in Flint have to buy bottled water for an insane price because their tap water is still undrinkable. A better world than one where your job requires you to install a mandatory app on your phone so they can track your location and sell your data and also prove you weren't at home during the sick leave and deny you pay. A better world than one where the same company that just laid off thousands of people is celebrating a record profit, and the CEO, who made a billion dollars, is on television telling you it's your fault.\n\nWe have an easier time imagining the end of the world than the end of capitalism. It's at the point where capitalism has essentially become a self-parody. It's an ideology that has infected every aspect of our lives to the point where even our leisure and our relationships are measured in terms of their economic value. That is the perhaps the most depressing part. We\u2019ve stopped asking if it's working or how we can disrupt it for something better and just started asking how we can be in the 1% that survives the collapse.\n\nAnd again, I'm looking at what happens when this trend intersects with AI. Of course the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The divide between them becomes not just a matter of a faster car or some convenience but longer lives and whether you can support children. Retail will increasingly live in poverty until some poverty-related event leads to their premature death. It's injustice that is suitably diffused so that no one can be held legally accountable.
