Not all podcasts have the same style and not everyone likes the same approach, so something that fits me might be totally unusable for you.\n\nPodcast I am listening to regularly:\n\n- The Daily Gwei: Very irregular schedule.

Sometimes has long rants about a niche topic which might not make sense for newcomers.\n\n- Bankless: For many years the best podcast in the ETH space. Covered everything from applications over protocol implementations to big picture perspective. Their quality deteriorated massively in Summer 2024 until Spring 2025. But now they turned around, at least in my view, and have quite interesting guests again. Some early podcasts by them were perfect to get into the space like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpzFU7MW5y4&list=PLmkdAgtxf3ahEmMWNY52BX3t1o7vb4aN5&index=237. This specific one is 4 years old, so some things might be outdated now. They are not always that critical with what their guests say and do not challenge them as often as I would like, but this improved as well in the last months, mostly by not inviting ill-informed guests on the podcast anymore.\n\n- Epicenter Podcast: Very application focused. They have guests from other chains as well. Some are great, some not so much. Here I pick and chose depending on the topic.\n\n- Zero Knowledge Podcast: Interviews applications and researchers in the cryptography space. Very interesting but sometimes very deep down the rabbit hole.\n\n- Ethfinance EVMavericks Weekly Doots Livestream: A weekly compilation of the best contributions in the r/ethereum daily thread. They also have a guest which talks about the project they are working on. Great way to learn about how some of the newer and also some established projects work.\n\n- Rocket Fuel: A community podcast done by Waqwaqattack from the rocketpool community. Covers rocketpool specific topics, but also talks about topics in the wider Ethereum space.\n\n\nI generally try to avoid anything that comes out of the blockworks podcast ecosystem they are very often ill-informed (or outright malicious). But even they sometimes have interesting guests from which I learned something, but that happens very seldomly. Unchained is another podcast that can give an easy entry for newcomers. Unfortunately, even though the host has been in the space for a very long time, they do not seem to understand some fundamentals and therefore do not challenge their guests were needed. So, even though it seems simple to follow, you might end up with a lot misinformation about certain topics that you have to unlearn again once you go deeper into the space.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>First of all, many podcasts are connected to an entity which wants to sell you a narrative.

They are not always that critical with what their guests say and do not challenge them as often as I would like, but this improved as well in the last months, mostly by not inviting ill-informed guests on the podcast anymore.</p></li>\n<li><p>Epicenter Podcast: Very application focused. They have guests from other chains as well. Some are great, some not so much. Here I pick and chose depending on the topic.</p></li>\n<li><p>Zero Knowledge Podcast: Interviews applications and researchers in the cryptography space. Very interesting but sometimes very deep down the rabbit hole.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ethfinance EVMavericks Weekly Doots Livestream: A weekly compilation of the best contributions in the <a href=\"/r/ethereum\">r/ethereum</a> daily thread. They also have a guest which talks about the project they are working on. Great way to learn about how some of the newer and also some established projects work.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rocket Fuel: A community podcast done by Waqwaqattack from the rocketpool community. Covers rocketpool specific topics, but also talks about topics in the wider Ethereum space.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I generally try to avoid anything that comes out of the blockworks podcast ecosystem they are very often ill-informed (or outright malicious). But even they sometimes have interesting guests from which I learned something, but that happens very seldomly. Unchained is another podcast that can give an easy entry for newcomers. Unfortunately, even though the host has been in the space for a very long time, they do not seem to understand some fundamentals and therefore do not challenge their guests were needed. So, even though it seems simple to follow, you might end up with a lot misinformation about certain topics that you have to unlearn again once you go deeper into the space.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-21 15:25:24","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nffkt7t","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nmj79g","parent_id":"t1_nfe9f50","score":35,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/eth2353","body":"I agree Bankless seems to have improved lately.

Some have been mentioned by others already. These points are obviously all speculative and depend on decisions done in the future.\n\n- Decentralization, censorship resistance and credible neutrality are not demanded by anyone in the space. So we end up in a walled garden of centralized databases like tempo, BNB and Solana. As always, no one needs these properties until they need them because they got debanked. At the moment there are quite a few projects which claim to be much more decentralized than they really are to get street creds. Similar things happened since the inception of our space, so not too worried here. \n\n- Staking centralization: Might be that in a few years only a handful of entities run validating nodes which makes it easier to collude for personal gains. Largest node operator is coinbase which has 11% of all validators. After them comes Kiln and Kraken with 5% each and then many in the 1-2% range (Source is rated.network and coinbases own reports). This means we are in an ok spot at the moment as there would need to be many entities colluding to do anything to the network. But centralization is in my view the natural way things go and there needs to be a constant battle against it.\n\n- People stop running (non-validating) nodes. This means no one outside of the inner circle is checking the integrity of the chain anymore. This might make stealth upgrades possible. See for example an upgrade that was pushed on solana by the solana foundation and the node operators last spring. The public only realized 2 weeks later that they stealthily updated the chain. Scary stuff. (https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-faces-scrutiny-after-private-patch-of-major-cryptographic-flaw/)\n\n- Resource demand for running a node skyrockets. This would lead to staking centralization as mentioned above. Difficult to balance and therefore can be slowly eroded over time.\n\n- An upgrade bricks the network. At the moment Ethereum has an 100% uptime. No rollbacks, no downtimes. Much better than anything else in our space. A narrative than can be lost with one single bug.\n\n- There just isn't enough demand for all the transactions we are scaling for. Similar to the first point.\n\n- Privacy never gets implemented properly. At the moment every transaction is transparent. For many states it is easy to connect your name to everything you are doing. You supported a group which is against the current people in power, that is straight to jail with you. There are ways to anonymize your transactions, but they are cumbersome and might make further transactions with centralized entities difficult.\n\n- Rollups might never get implemented properly. At the moment the largest rollups do have lower security guarantees than they could have. Most are working towards improving that, but progress is slower than, at least I, expected.\n\n- Ethereum governance process gets co-opted by malicious actors or turns into a fruitless turf war. Ethereum governance is complex but has shown a lot of resilience against influence of single actors, which is great for a credible neutral Network. This could get subverted by some larger entities.\n\n- People might like Ethereum the Network, but not use Ethereum the token as much. Similar to how many people love Bitcoin the token, but only very few use the network at all.\n\n- Regulatory issues. Mostly gone now, but they might come back at some point in the future.\n\n- A decentralized Network of companies like the Ethereum space is not as efficient in pushing narrative as other projects in the crypto space. Having thousands of uncoordinated voices makes it easier for malicious actors to divide and conquer, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail\n\nI am sure I missed many other possible bear cases. As you can imagine I am all in on ETH not because I think it is smooth sailing for the Ethereum space, but because I think other ecosystems are in much rougher water than they claim to be. And some haven't even built a ship yet but claim to already winning the race...\n\nI am honestly not sure where to read about all the bear cases. In my view the Ethereum space has a lot of intellectual honest people which discuss the bad sides and trade-offs of certain paths in detail, but I do not know of any easily accessible site. For me one of the better ones is Vitaliks website (vitalik.eth.limo) which discusses alternative roads from time time. Podcasts where he appears are always great and the way he discusses topics it is easy to see bear cases if things go a different path.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>A few bear cases for our space.

Ethereum governance is complex but has shown a lot of resilience against influence of single actors, which is great for a credible neutral Network. This could get subverted by some larger entities.</p></li>\n<li><p>People might like Ethereum the Network, but not use Ethereum the token as much. Similar to how many people love Bitcoin the token, but only very few use the network at all.</p></li>\n<li><p>Regulatory issues. Mostly gone now, but they might come back at some point in the future.</p></li>\n<li><p>A decentralized Network of companies like the Ethereum space is not as efficient in pushing narrative as other projects in the crypto space. Having thousands of uncoordinated voices makes it easier for malicious actors to divide and conquer, see: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am sure I missed many other possible bear cases. As you can imagine I am all in on ETH not because I think it is smooth sailing for the Ethereum space, but because I think other ecosystems are in much rougher water than they claim to be. And some haven&#39;t even built a ship yet but claim to already winning the race...</p>\n\n<p>I am honestly not sure where to read about all the bear cases. In my view the Ethereum space has a lot of intellectual honest people which discuss the bad sides and trade-offs of certain paths in detail, but I do not know of any easily accessible site. For me one of the better ones is Vitaliks website (vitalik.eth.limo) which discusses alternative roads from time time. Podcasts where he appears are always great and the way he discusses topics it is easy to see bear cases if things go a different path.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-21 16:33:04","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-09-22 06:20:50","id":"nffysjx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nmj79g","parent_id":"t1_nfdjfma","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"Damn dude, you\u2019re such a machine.  \ud83e\udee1","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Damn dude, you\u2019re such a machine.  \ud83e\udee1</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-22 03:13:51","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nfjefie","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nmj79g","parent_id":"t1_nffysjx","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"[The machine](https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1567089731784.jpg)\n\nBut to be fair, I think I sometimes find the right answer, but seldomly on the first try.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1567089731784.jpg\">The machine</a></p>\n\n<p>But to be fair, I think I sometimes find the right answer, but seldomly on the first try.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-22 06:17:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nfk0zd6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nmj79g","parent_id":"t1_nfjefie","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"I would love to be right on the first try too, but it's not the same effort as what you give.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I would love to be right on the first try too, but it&#39;s not the same effort as what you give.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-24 03:07:50","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nfvwi3l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nmj79g","parent_id":"t1_nfk0zd6","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/dentonnn","body":"one thing I love most about this place is how we discuss the bear cases in good faith","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>one thing I love most about this place is how we discuss the bear cases in good faith</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-09-22 04:42:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nfjq8qd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1nmj79g","parent_id":"t1_nffysjx","score":5,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"I think I mentioned somewhere else before that the reason I am in the Ethereum space is not that I think we have won already, but that I think I can have a good overview over the roadblocks ahead of us and the measures the ecosystem takes to avoid them.
