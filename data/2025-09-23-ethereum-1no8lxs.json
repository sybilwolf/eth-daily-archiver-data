you have a lemonade stand, and your lemonade is really popular. Let's say your company, \"BMNR,\" is worth a lot of money because people really love your lemonade.\nNow, you decide you need some extra cash to buy a bigger juicer and more lemons. You have a few options, but you decide to sell some ownership in your lemonade stand.\nHere's the deal you just made:\n\u00a0* You sold 5 million shares (tiny pieces of ownership) for $70 each.\n\u00a0 \u00a0* The day before, your shares were only worth $61.29. So, it seems like a great deal! You got $45 million more than your shares were \"worth\" on the market. That's like selling a single cup of lemonade for $7 when everyone else is selling it for $6.13. It sounds awesome, right?\n\u00a0* But... you also gave away 10 million \"warrants.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0* Think of a warrant like a coupon. This coupon gives someone the right to buy one of your shares for $87.50 at some point in the future.\n\u00a0 \u00a0* This coupon is super valuable! Even though the person has to pay $87.50 later, the coupon itself is worth a lot of money right now. The expert says this coupon is worth about $27 each.\n\u00a0 \u00a0* Why is it so valuable? Because if your company does really well and your stock goes way up, say to $100, the person with the coupon can buy your stock for a super-cheap $87.50 and instantly make a ton of money. So, the coupon is like a lottery ticket with a high chance of winning.\n\u00a0 \u00a0* You just gave away $281 million worth of these valuable coupons for free!\nSo, let's do the math:\n\u00a0* You gained $45 million from the great deal on the share sale.\n\u00a0* You gave away $281 million in valuable coupons (the warrants).\nWhat's the final result?\n\u00a0* $45 million (gained) - $281 million (given away) = -$236 million!\nInstead of getting ahead, you actually gave away a huge amount of value from your lemonade stand. You got a nice little boost of cash upfront, but you put your company in a position where others could make a huge profit at your expense.\nThe part about \"hedging\" is like this: The person who got the coupons can now go out and make more money by making bets that your stock will go up, which makes them even richer.\nSo, while it looked like you got a great deal at first glance (selling shares for a high price), you secretly gave away a massive amount of value, and it hurt your company in the long run.
