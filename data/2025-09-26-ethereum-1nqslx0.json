People were complaining that their requests were stuck for more than 14 days even though the widget showed 5 days. They would respond saying the widget is unreliable and that the queue was 40 days on beacon chain so it was to be expected.\n\nHere's the kicker. Today, the Lido protocol received 150K ETH of inflows from an unknown dormant whale. This conveniently reduced the queue to 0 ETH and everyone gets to withdraw.\n\nMy theory is that they knew they would be injecting 100-150K effectively allowing them to not put validators in the exit queue.\n\nThis would all be fine and dandy if it wasn't because they have intentionally protected their Curated module operators, which are big entities in the scene, at the expense of their permissionless operators of CSM et al... \n\nAgain this is all a theory but I would guess this was coordinated and that Curated module node operators are in on it, and this makes Lido slightly sketchy because their off chain shenanigans render the onchain dynamics of Lido contracts a little bit useless, if they don't play by the rules they themselves have established.\n\nMaybe this was Kiln? No idea.\n\nSurely, I'm wrong.
