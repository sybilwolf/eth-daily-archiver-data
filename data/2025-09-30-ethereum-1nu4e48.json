They just released the first video of a dGEN1 in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iZjyIhlBIc\n\nThe video goes through how their wallet works, how they integrate with other dapps and their own dappstore. They wallet is an account abstraction wallet where the private keys never leave the device, but they have the option to recover a wallet using an NFC card which can recover a wallet on a different phone. They also allow to set a backup address which can recover the wallet, but it is not recommended at the moment. \n\nTo me it looks like they wrote quite some custom code for this device. The second narrow screen at the bottom has additional information for the transactions and the dot matrix changes depending on the state of the transaction. They also have a gas account which you can load up and then transact on any chain, even though you do not have any ETH on that chain. Personally, I am not sure how good the user experience will be using the wallet, but in the video it looks much smoother than I expected. \n\nIn general dGEN1 runs GrapheneOS which is a security focused fork of Android with all the google tracking taken out by default. Might be that freedomfactory, the company behind the dGEN1, tweaked the base GrapheneOS a bit to run on their devices, but I have no information if and how much they did that. \n\nThe first dGEN1 devices have been sent out a few weeks ago, but only to a select few KOLs. As far as I understand they are not allowed to talk about the device publicly. No idea why, but I guess that is the reason why almost only still images of people using the device are around and no reviews yet. Maybe they want to maximize the publicity by having a fixed date for first reviews so that more people start ordering the device. \n\nYesterday, the broader public received their first shipping confirmations. Many people who burned their dGEN1 NFT in June have received one. I guess in the next few weeks we will see the first devices in the hand of users. I am actually curious how usable the interface is. When I got my NFT last December I honestly did not believe to receive a device and fully expected the project to fail, just because building smartphones can be very hard, especially with all the additional features they have (2nd narrow screen and dot matrix) and then building an additional wallet on top does not make it easier. So, I am pretty happy with the state of the project and looking forward getting mine soonish and playing with it.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For those interested in what ethOS (the Ethereum phone) people are doing.
