There are roughly 6 ETH for every 1 BTC, yet BTC trades at around 27 ETH. Given ETH\u2019s stronger fundamentals, that ratio is completely irrational. If ETH were just another random shitcoin, sure - but it\u2019s not. This gap highlights the power of Bitcoin\u2019s marketing and how much damage the SEC\u2019s actions against ETH have done. It\u2019s going to be a long road back to a more reasonable 1:6 ratio.</p>\n\n<p>Look at ZEC as another example.
