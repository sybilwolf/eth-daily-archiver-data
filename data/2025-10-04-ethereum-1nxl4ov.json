Stake has been centralizing over the last few years, the trend is clear and every day a larger % of Ethereum validators is managed by a handful of entitites.\n\nNot all of these large staking service providers are 100% transparent about how many validators they manage (in contrast to Lido where at least we can inspect everything on-chain). But from [the numbers that we do have access to](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), we can estimate that today roughly 1/3 of Ethereum's validators is managed by only 10 entities. I myself am still kind of okay with the current state of things when it comes to centralization (although I'd welcome any improvement).\n\nWhat is looming ahead though are staked ETH ETFs, institutions and treasury companies staking. Out of regulatory concerns, those are all looking for the most compliant solutions which means they're going to end up staking with the largest staking providers who can afford to tick all the regulatory checkboxes and legal requirements. These compliance-first solutions will likely be the first to implement censorship measures and any other measures their local regulator pressures them into supporting.\n\n___\n\nWe will probably see the number of staked ETH go up over the next years.
