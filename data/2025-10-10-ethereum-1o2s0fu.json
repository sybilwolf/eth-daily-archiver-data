Also, <strong>in order to compete with other chains, Ethereum will have to scale and that has seen the rise of L2/sidechains which results in loss  transaction fees and MEV tips essentially stealing value from ETH.  This essentially turns Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Tron, L2/Sidechains, etc into competing networks for DeFi casinos and rails for StablecCoin transfers where they have to remain cheap or utility and users will move to competing chains.</strong>  BTC on the other hand has no competition.  It doesn&#39;t have to scale, it doesn&#39;t have to become cheap, it doesn&#39;t have to keep advancing, it doesn&#39;t have to keep up with the competition because there is no competition.
