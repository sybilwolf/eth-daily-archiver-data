I had no FOMO to buy when token X or Y was worth $500, and I have no interest or reason to buy now that it&#39;s worth $0.5 and has the marketcap of a lemonade stand.</p>\n\n<p>In my mind, the Altcoin experiment is over, and has failed. The death of Solana (it will happen sooner or later, maybe when its blockchain reaches three Exabytes?) will be further proof. I had some fun with it for a while (when I was salty at its outperformance over ETH for like a year), made some beer money, got some airdrops, and got out.</p>\n\n<p>If your response is going to be &quot;bottom signal for Alts&quot;, sure, maybe you can make 2-3X if you hit the correct one in the casino, but it will still be true that they need 10X at best and 10000X at worst to even go back to where they stood in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>So, where does this leave us? What&#39;s the thesis? Well, there&#39;s only one coin besides BTC that feels &quot;alive&quot;. That has volume, activity, metrics compared to BTC. That has managed to not die for ten years, and is also the <strong><em>ONLY</em></strong>  coin that hit a new ATH for three cycles in a row... every single cycle it has existed. No other coin has managed that. Every coin launched in 2015 is long forgotten by now. It would be as exceptional as Feathercoin still hitting new ATHs. (A notable exception is the first Altcoin, Litecoin, but even that ranges around the price it had in 2013.)</p>\n\n<p>Only Ethereum can challenge Bitcoin now. And it would have no chance of doing so, if Bitcoin wasn&#39;t so <em>bad</em>. And even so, it has to become <em>perfect</em>. Absolutely perfect. In decentralization, in scaling, in speed, in UX. You can&#39;t defeat the network effect of Bitcoin any other way.</p>\n\n<p>But... this might take a while. It could take years. Many years.</p>\n\n<p>So, for now, I am still wearing my white Crab priest cloak.</p>\n\n<p>Because Ethereum Crabbing, and not meeting the fate of all other Altcoins, is a <em>good thing</em>. No matter how frustrating.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-10-11 15:29:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"niybwv6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1o3mwcl","parent_id":"t3_1o3mwcl","score":36,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/confusedguy1212","body":"I agree with that sentiment.
