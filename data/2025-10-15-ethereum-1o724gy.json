Apparently they own most of it and they plan to use the revenue from it to acquire more ETH. BitDigital is also going the Microstrategy route of using unsecured debt to finance the purchase of more ETH.

I don't personally buy this argument but the mechanism for this seems to be that SBet is planning to use ETH to stake and earn yield on Linea and to use the coming Metamask and Linea reward programs to incentivize behavior that benefits strategic investments Consensys is going to make. Obviously this means there's going to be a Metamask token so go farm your airdrops.\n\n3) Bitmine carries around $600M in cash so they can proactively buy the dip of either ETH or BMNR. This explains how they just acquired about 400k ETH during the crash. After they acquire 5% of ETH supply they are going to focus investments in rails to accelerate the adoption of Ethereum by wall street. Tom Lee has described this before as kingmaking and I bet if they come to protocols with $1B of TVL they'll be able to negotiate some kind of bribe/kickback not available to common depositors.\n\n4) The reason Bitmine is buying ETH like there's no tomorrow is they want to solidify their position as being the most liquid DAT and enter index funds like the Russel 1000 during the next rebalance in June 2026. This would make them eligible for investments from about 1500 large cap funds, essentially creating a flywheel of buy pressure on BMNR. This is also why they want to keep their balance sheet as clean as possible, it makes the story for the inclusion of BMNR in those indexes less complicated than if they had side business income like BitDigital or complicated debt like MSTR. They want to get that sovereign wealth fund bid into ETH via including BMNR in major indexes.

I'm out of my depth to explain why this is but hopefully someone in here can help. Why is Ethereum being 50% more volatile than Bitcoin a good thing to institutions?

But the execution is starting to crumble.
