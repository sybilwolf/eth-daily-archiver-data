This was a year or so ago, so the details are hazy.\n\nThe basic idea was there is an immutable [`RootPoster` contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x591663413423dcf7c7806930e642951e0dddf10b), which emits a log containing the [latest blockhash](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x1f67785f7aa68bf0b8592cc4e92710c5dde249c8fea876bd6d1a4211047f1d3b#eventlog).  Eventually, this transaction gets included into a checkpoint that Polygon commits to L1.  You can then use the existing `/exit-payload/` API to generate a proof of that transaction, prove it emitted the log, and prove the value (blockhash) in the log.  \n\nThe gateway can supply a witness that contains this exit proof + the block header ingredients.  Combined with the onchain checkpoint, the onchain verifier can verify the exit proof, confirm it matches the block header, and then extract the state root, and then prove arbitrary state on Polygon using additional `eth_getProof`'s.\n\nFor a demo, I funded an EoA with a few bucks and \"posted\" hourly blockhashes with a bot for a few weeks.  The contract is trustless so literally anyone can pay gas (eg. [`post()`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x591663413423dcf7c7806930e642951e0dddf10b#writeContract)) to include a transaction into a checkpoint.\n\nThe trust is minimized to the poster contract (which is trivial to audit) and the validity of the checkpoints (which I believe is shared with bridge withdrawals.)  The onchain verifier is bound to a specific poster contract address and Polygon checkpoint contract (`IRootChain`).\n\n\n    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n    pragma solidity ^0.8.23;\n\n    contract RootPoster {\n        event NewRoot(bytes32 indexed prevBlockHash);\n        function post() external {\n            emit NewRoot(blockhash(block.number - 1));\n        }\n    }","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>For ENS, I explored how we could read trustless state from Polygon PoS with <a href=\"https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways\">Unruggable</a> Gateways.
