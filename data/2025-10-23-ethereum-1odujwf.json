What effects will this have on ETH by 2030?</p>\n\n<p>Your right on many things. I think its best to not try to predict when ETH will take off and have a realistic timeline to see this play out. I&#39;ve also been overly optimistic in the past. 2030 is enough time to see what&#39;s really going to happen.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I think understandibly you and many others have PTSD on ETHs performance so its hard to think that it can really +10x from here.</p>\n\n<p>What is True is that M2 money supply will expand significantly.
