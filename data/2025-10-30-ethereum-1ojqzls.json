When I got into ETH back in 2017, I knew that this will not happen overnight and that it would likely take over a decade. Ethereum is only 10 years old today and already worth half a trillion. It&#39;s actually surpassed my expectations, of where I thought we&#39;d be by now,  if I&#39;m honest.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-10-30 13:51:19","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-10-30 13:54:51","id":"nm6x3uk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ojqzls","parent_id":"t1_nm6ujnm","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/spiegs-657","body":"I think if your argument is that the NASDAQ needs to start issuing stocks on ETH, or something of that magnitude, for this to break out, then every person should sell because the odds of that taking place on a timeframe over which the S&P 500 or any other asset won\u2019t massively outperform ETH\u2019s crabbing is infinitesimally small","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I think if your argument is that the NASDAQ needs to start issuing stocks on ETH, or something of that magnitude, for this to break out, then every person should sell because the odds of that taking place on a timeframe over which the S&amp;P 500 or any other asset won\u2019t massively outperform ETH\u2019s crabbing is infinitesimally small</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-10-30 14:01:57","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nm6z8yp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ojqzls","parent_id":"t1_nm6x3uk","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/whisperedstate","body":"I think something of that magnitude needs to be a catalyst, yes.
