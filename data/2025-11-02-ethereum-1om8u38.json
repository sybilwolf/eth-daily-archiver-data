He was asking about a massive spike in blob gas fees last Thursday. I looked into what probably happened. My response got a bit longer than I first intended and maybe some other people are interested in it as well, so I post it in todays daily.\n\nThanks, I was not aware there was such a massive blob gas fee spike on Thursday afternoon (UTC time). Blobs have a similar pricing mechanics like normal transactions on Ethereum. There is currently a target of 6 blobs per block. If more blobs are posted, the price increases until the rollups stop publishing more than 6 blobs per block and then the blob price goes down again. I looked at the various data from the time of the spike and here is what I think happened. First of all I am not sure that the ultrasound money data is accurate. There definitely was a price increase, but I am not sure it was that huge at that time. I think one reason for my confusion is that some sources state blob gas prices as price per byte of blob space (Etherscan) ~~and other sources state the blob gas prices as price per blob (Ultrasound money)~~ (EDIT: see discussion below. Looks like ultrasound.money just reports gas fees wrongly) . 1 Blob has 128 kiB or 131072 byte ~~, so depending on where you look you can see massive numbers~~ (EDIT: same reason as above. Ultrasound.money is most probably wrong in their numbers). Even though the numbers seem very high, the actual price in dollar terms paid is not that much. I found prices of $0.37 paid for the blob fee alone around that time. This is still less than the price paid for publishing the paid blob on chain, which was around $3.50 around that time.\n\nNow lets look at the spike itself. At the moment we are on average close to the 6 blobs target (5-6.2 blobs on average). It only needs a small increase in blob demand to go over the target and prices start increasing exponentially. On Thursday we had a very volatile time in the market with the ETH price went down about $300 within a few hours. It then partially recovered afterwards. This volatility increases DEFI activity also on rollups which then lead to increased blob demand. According to Hildobby's Dune dashboard there also seems to have been an increased blob demand by a relatively unknown rollup called 'Shape' around the same time.

The upcoming Fusaka upgrade on December 3rd will increase the blob target/limit from the current 6/9 to 10/15 and then 14/21 within a few weeks. That more then doubles the blob space. It will take some time to fill that up. And currently core devs are already discussing going to 64/72 within a few months. That would increase the blob space by more than a factor of 10 from today. More than enough space to absorb the spikes. To make sure blobs are not handed out for free, Fusaka introduces EIP-7918 which sets a dynamic minimal price for blobs.

He was asking about a massive spike in blob gas fees last Thursday. I looked into what probably happened. My response got a bit longer than I first intended and maybe some other people are interested in it as well, so I post it in todays daily.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, I was not aware there was such a massive blob gas fee spike on Thursday afternoon (UTC time). Blobs have a similar pricing mechanics like normal transactions on Ethereum. There is currently a target of 6 blobs per block. If more blobs are posted, the price increases until the rollups stop publishing more than 6 blobs per block and then the blob price goes down again. I looked at the various data from the time of the spike and here is what I think happened. First of all I am not sure that the ultrasound money data is accurate. There definitely was a price increase, but I am not sure it was that huge at that time. I think one reason for my confusion is that some sources state blob gas prices as price per byte of blob space (Etherscan) <del>and other sources state the blob gas prices as price per blob (Ultrasound money)</del> (EDIT: see discussion below. Looks like ultrasound.money just reports gas fees wrongly) . 1 Blob has 128 kiB or 131072 byte <del>, so depending on where you look you can see massive numbers</del> (EDIT: same reason as above. Ultrasound.money is most probably wrong in their numbers). Even though the numbers seem very high, the actual price in dollar terms paid is not that much. I found prices of $0.37 paid for the blob fee alone around that time. This is still less than the price paid for publishing the paid blob on chain, which was around $3.50 around that time.</p>\n\n<p>Now lets look at the spike itself. At the moment we are on average close to the 6 blobs target (5-6.2 blobs on average). It only needs a small increase in blob demand to go over the target and prices start increasing exponentially. On Thursday we had a very volatile time in the market with the ETH price went down about $300 within a few hours. It then partially recovered afterwards. This volatility increases DEFI activity also on rollups which then lead to increased blob demand. According to Hildobby&#39;s Dune dashboard there also seems to have been an increased blob demand by a relatively unknown rollup called &#39;Shape&#39; around the same time. Shape was the second largest blob user for several hours. No idea why Shape had such a demand increase, because I do not see any activity increase on their L2Beat page. Maybe it was just an algorithm of theirs going haywire.
