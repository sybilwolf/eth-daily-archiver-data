I just did a quick news search - see links below. There&#39;s about 7 BNB for every 1 BTC. And there are regular token burns. So 104 BNB buys 1 BTC. I can see the ratio drop to 50 BNB for 1 BTC or even less than that, and it would still be undervalued relative to Bitcoin. What can Bitcoin do? It&#39;s a pet rock like Dogecoin. After watching this space since 2017, 104 BNB for 1 BTC just doesn\u2019t feel like a fair ratio.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/376174/kyrgyzstan-to-launch-stablecoin-on-bnb-plans-cbdc-in-partnership-with-adviser-changpeng-zhao\">https://www.theblock.co/post/376174/kyrgyzstan-to-launch-stablecoin-on-bnb-plans-cbdc-in-partnership-with-adviser-changpeng-zhao</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-13/china-renaissance-seeks-600-million-for-bnb-crypto-treasury\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-13/china-renaissance-seeks-600-million-for-bnb-crypto-treasury</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/27/bnb-jumps-over-3-after-usd1-69b-token-burn-overtakes-xrp-s-market-cap\">https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/27/bnb-jumps-over-3-after-usd1-69b-token-burn-overtakes-xrp-s-market-cap</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/two-thirds-of-bnb-supply-held-by-the-public-cz-owns-less-than-1-yzi-labs/\">https://cryptopotato.com/two-thirds-of-bnb-supply-held-by-the-public-cz-owns-less-than-1-yzi-labs/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/376595/pardon-of-binances-zhao-is-rocket-fuel-for-bnb-token-ecosystem-says-treasury-ceo\">https://www.theblock.co/post/376595/pardon-of-binances-zhao-is-rocket-fuel-for-bnb-token-ecosystem-says-treasury-ceo</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bnb-news-world3-and-4aibsc-join-forces-to-launch-decentralized-ai-marketplace-on-bnb-chain/\">https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bnb-news-world3-and-4aibsc-join-forces-to-launch-decentralized-ai-marketplace-on-bnb-chain/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/david-namdar-bnb-is-digital-infrastructure-equity-and-its-massively-undervalued-in-the-west/\">https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/david-namdar-bnb-is-digital-infrastructure-equity-and-its-massively-undervalued-in-the-west/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-11-03 07:53:45","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nmugr36","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1on460t","parent_id":"t1_nmu87ex","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/airprimetime","body":"Since I\u2019m in a fortunate position and haven\u2019t had the need to cash out yet (long term holder and my target is around 2x from ath).
