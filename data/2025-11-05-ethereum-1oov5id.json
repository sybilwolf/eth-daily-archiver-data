Lighter is a perp DEX, similar to hyperliquid or Aster and the uncountably many perp CEXs. Perpetual exchanges are used by many to leverage (10x-100x) long or short the market. I personally do not touch them because leverage is the easiest way to get flushed out of the market, especially in highly volatile times like now. One can also use them to hedge market risks or lock in current prices for a future sale of locked tokens, but as the 10/10 crash showed one cannot fully not rely on perps to have a delta neutral portfolio. Nevertheless, Lighter is an interesting case for Ethereums modular approach as Lighter is not a full EVM rollup it can do perp dex specific transactions only. That means no overhead, no slow zk proof creation due to the many complex EVM opcodes. Just pure perp DEX action. Lighter also does not publish each individual transaction in Blobs. It just publishes the state changes since the last published blob on Ethereum. This means if someone did a thousand transactions on their account since the last published blob it still means it only needs 1 entry for the state update. That is a very efficient approach. The state diffs approach is something only zk rollups can do and many do that (ZKsync, Starknet, ...). Optimistic rollups need to publish the full transaction data for other people to prove that the current state is correct, but with zk rollups the zk proof already proves that the current state is correct, so zk rollups just have to publish the state diff since the last update. Pretty neat. At the moment Lighter seems to update its state every few minutes on Ethereum. \n\nIn the last few weeks L2Beat evaluated the implementation of Lighter and published their findings yesterday. Lighter only has one red slice in the five risk slices. Everything else is green. It still is a stage 0 rollup though, because the L2Beat team did not yet verify that the open source code for their node is able to reconstruct the current state. If this succeeds they become a stage 1 rollup. And then it is only a question of how they set up their councils for smart contract upgrades so people have a long enough exit window in case of a malicious bridge contract upgrade. The interesting part is that even now, the escape hatch functionality is implemented. That means users can exit their funds in case of proposer failure or front end censorship. Not sure how user friendly this process is though. The front end censorship is an issue on hyperliquid as some users could deposit, but when they wanted to withdraw, their funds where frozen as their wallet was somehow connected to unwanted entities or jurisdictions. \n\nAs lighter is a perp DEX, it naturally has a lot of transactions. Each individual bid and ask price change as each individual change in the orderbook needs a transaction. Most of these are done by bots to provide liquidity and arbitrage the different DEXs and CEXs. That is why on L2Beat the daily activity jumped from a few hundrerds TPS a few weeks ago to 4.5k TPS yesterday. Pretty amazing development in my view. It makes it a bit more difficult to follow the TPS changes of fully EVM compatible rollups though as they are all overshadowed by Lighter. Maybe L2Beat finds a neat way to show EVM compatible rollups and app specific rollups in different colours on the activity chart. \n\nIf you want to know more about Ligher, Bankles has a good interview with the founder (see links below) and I thought it was a pretty honest evaluation how Lighter fared in the 10/10 crash.
