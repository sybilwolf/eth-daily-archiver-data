It&#39;s hard not to monitor this space in real time because there&#39;s so much going on, but truly most of it is noise. 50000 price refreshes to go from 4k to 3k and back to 4k is pointless. Wasted mental effort for nothing. What&#39;s even more pointless is I have no intention of selling any time soon, so why hyper fixate on every peak and valley over a decade long investment.</p>\n\n<p>Trying to do better ignoring short term PA (no matter how horrendous), filter out the noise, make sure nothing critical has broken with the markets or the asset, then move on if thesis unchanged. Getting fully out of leverage also helps with this. I find even having a 0.5% portfolio leverage position adds to the stress. Spot and chill.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-11-08 00:30:40","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-11-08 00:34:21","id":"nnouaey","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1oqmnl2","parent_id":"t3_1oqmnl2","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/InsuranceGuyQuestion","body":"Seriously, one price correction and people are forgetting all the exciting news happening with ETH right now.\n\nWe're at a pretty pivotal point in history with the adoption with ETH, outside of the price, all signs are pointing to ETH taking over.
