It currently only uses between 300-400GB of space on the ssd (including a newly synced consensus client). This is pretty nice. Obviously, if you configure your node in that way you cannot help other nodes to sync to the network, as you do not have the needed blocks and receipts anymore. I am planning to use this on a fallback node which I do not want to upgrade the disk at the moment, so my main node still has all the receipts and blocks. Erigon has a similar setting called 'minimal' node which uses about the same disk space and I guess they use the same tricks with history pruning.

He is an OG cypherpunk who founded the Free Software Movement and launched the GNU Project in 1983 to create a free Unix-like operating system. I was really looking forward to listening to him speak but he launched into a complaint about crypto immediately, saying that he knew many of were in favour but he was not, as he did not want to mine for crypto and the only other way to get it was to purchase from a centralized exchange using digital payment systems such as credit cards and that his only option to own some would be to ask a friend to buy some for him. The real solution, he told us, was Taler tokens. User could buy tokens from their bank accounts for anonymous spending but they, and the merchants, were still trackable such that tax evasion wasn't possible. He made a joke about the future being Taler-able and\u00a0that all other options were intalerable. No one laughed.

For 12+ months, Gold and Bitcoin moved with high correlation; the safe haven assets. Since early-October, Gold has outperformed Bitcoin by 25 percentage points.\n\nThe trend is even more evident outside of Bitcoin. Take a look at Ether which is now officially down -8.5% on the year. Since October 6th, Ether is down a massive -35%. This is beyond bear market territory despite a broader rally in ALL risky assets across the board.\n\nTherefore, when you really zoom out, it seems that crypto is in a \"structural\" bear market. The fundamental value of crypto has only improved, but market dynamics are shifting. As with any efficient market, the wrinkles will work their way out.
