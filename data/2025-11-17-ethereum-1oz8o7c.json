Short spikes in usage can trigger massive price increases. Last time we had such high numbers discussed here it was ultrasound money which misreported the fees. This time is different though. It looks like we averaged above 6 for a few hours before the massive spike. I found transactions which paid a blob base fee of 44M Gwei, which is even above the 34M Gwei I see on ultrasound money. That transaction paid 0.044 ETH (~$135) to include 3 blobs. Most of it was burnt. I do not think I have seen prices like this before. According to hildobby's dune dashboard, blobs burnt over $17K in a short period of time. Pretty impressive. I do not see a single rollup that increased its blob production around that time, it rather looks like a broad demand increase from many rollups. \n\nSource\n\na high fee transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfdb40456749132d8ff3a6db3f0fc86b38dfbf29ac9a92df6ed264f75d9ece696","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Blobs have been close to the target of 6 for some time now.
