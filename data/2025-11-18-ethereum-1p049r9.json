Then that still wasn\u2019t enough. The arguments keep shifting.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin sits in a special category where the only expectation is that its price keeps climbing. First 1 BTC \u201cneeded\u201d to be $100k. Then it \u201cneeded\u201d to be $1 million. The narrative is always about a higher price, never about performance or capability.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s the core difference: Bitcoin is judged purely on monetary appreciation, while Ethereum is judged on ever-escalating technical demands. That cycle has to be broken. If Ethereum is always held to a moving technical standard while Bitcoin is only held to a price target, ETH will continue to look like the riskier, slower horse - and it will never catch up to BTC or retrace the ratio losses of the past few years.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-11-18 09:47:26","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"npguc6o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1p049r9","parent_id":"t1_npgflmm","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/mini_miner1","body":"Yup I agree with you.

For example James Dion from Udemy hosts his servers in Puerto Rico and Philippines. That maintains data availability 24h. Those are 2 different governments. America and Philippines.
