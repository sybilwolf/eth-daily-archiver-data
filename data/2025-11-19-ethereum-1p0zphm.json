I am a node operator on Aztec. Had to buy quite a lot of Aztec tokens to run a few sequencers. Or in other words, I have a bag. So keep that in mind when reading the rest of my post about Aztec. I honestly do not expect to get rich from it as my tokens are locked for a year and who knows what these tokens are worth then. \n\n\nThe Aztec mainnet just got bootstrapped by around 100 node operators. About 12 hours ago, the Aztec smart contract reached the minimal stake to be able to start the rollup. The start had a few bumps, but overall it went pretty smooth. Three of the first four blocks were missed, but afterwards it was as expected. This bootstrap was achieved not with the stake of the Aztec Foundation, but around 100 individual node operators all staked their tokens. The Aztec Foundation isn't even allowed to run sequencers or stake any tokens in the first year to not centralize the sequencer set. For those who do not know, Aztec is a privacy preserving zk rollup with a decentralized sequencer set.\n\nThe current phase of Aztec mainnet, called Ignition, does not allow for user transactions on the network. At the moment the focus is to test and stabilize the block production with real economics. The published blocks are empty for now. In about 3 months, sequencers will start publishing actual transactions. In that phase the network is still considered in alpha stage, but people can deploy privacy preserving smart contracts and make transactions. With the alpha stage, the focus is to make the whole Aztec ecosystem more resilient, improve the user experience and increase privacy and security by enabling forced transaction inclusion and run private RPCs. I think in the alpha stage anyone is allowed to run sequencers as well or stake their tokens. There is also a delegated staking functionality, which at the moment needs you to stake 200k Aztec tokens. No smaller stake amounts are possible at the moment. Maybe at the point of the alpha launch this changes. Overall, I am not a big fan of delegated staking as this normally speeds up sequencer centralization.\n\nAs aztec is close to a based rollup it shares a lot of the trade offs with based rollups. The great thing is that it has a decentralized sequencer set from the start. Currently, there are about 100 individual sequencers publishing blocks. The disadvantage is that the block time is limited by Ethereum L1. So at most a block every 12s. Because publishing each block as a blob on L1 costs ETH, one wants to have the blob as full of transactions as possible. Currently the time between blocks is set to 72s, which is a trade off between the cost and the user experience. Might be that with the alpha launch this gets reduced to 36s, but it needs a governance vote to do that. As most of these blobs will not even be close to full for a long time, transactions will cost more than on 'normal' rollups. This leads to a worse UX than other high performance rollups which have block times below 1s. I do not know if they plan to include preconfirmations in any way. This makes Aztec not that enticing for degen activities that need instant transaction confirmations and fast price updates, but it probably is a tradeoff necessary for decentralization and resilience of the network. There is also a discussion that Ethereum might allow partial blob filling or blob sharing, which can reduce the price per transaction again, but I am not sure at what stage these plans are on Ethereums side. Running sequencers is also bit more involved than running a validator on Ethereum. One needs a full Ethereum node and then run an aztec node as well. As Aztec sequencers also need to to publish blobs, they need an address filled with ETH to do this, but the network pays you in Aztec tokens, so depending on Ethereum blob fees and the Aztec token price, you might earn something or actually pay more than you earn. I means you need to be juggling a few more things to be profitable.\n\nAztec is privacy preserving and therefore cannot be fully EVM compatible, which also means that Ethereum wallets and wallet addresses do not work on Aztec. On testnet one could test out some other browser wallets. I would hope that over time more and more of the established wallets will include Aztec accounts to be able to interact with the chain in the usual fashion. But I guess this will take time. Aztec accounts are smart accounts, so one can pay with various tokens. I am not aware that they shared more details about what tokens are supported and how much extra one has to pay. My impression is that Aztec the execution environment will need a lot of fine tuning. On testnets, the possibility for user transaction was rather limited, so I guess it is not 100% here yet. I also could never bridge as the existing bridges never worked when I had the time to test them. Not sure if they worked at all. As Aztec is a fully programmable privacy preserving rollup, protocol designers can make any kind of transaction private. Not just simple ETH transfers. One can imagine private token sales, private NFT marketplaces, private voting and much more. It will take time until all this comes together, but a first initial milestone has been achieved a few hours ago with bootstrapping mainnet.\n\nAll in all I am very excited to finally have a privacy preserving solution on Ethereum.

I am a node operator on Aztec. Had to buy quite a lot of Aztec tokens to run a few sequencers. Or in other words, I have a bag. So keep that in mind when reading the rest of my post about Aztec. I honestly do not expect to get rich from it as my tokens are locked for a year and who knows what these tokens are worth then. </p>\n\n<p>The Aztec mainnet just got bootstrapped by around 100 node operators. About 12 hours ago, the Aztec smart contract reached the minimal stake to be able to start the rollup. The start had a few bumps, but overall it went pretty smooth. Three of the first four blocks were missed, but afterwards it was as expected. This bootstrap was achieved not with the stake of the Aztec Foundation, but around 100 individual node operators all staked their tokens. The Aztec Foundation isn&#39;t even allowed to run sequencers or stake any tokens in the first year to not centralize the sequencer set. For those who do not know, Aztec is a privacy preserving zk rollup with a decentralized sequencer set.</p>\n\n<p>The current phase of Aztec mainnet, called Ignition, does not allow for user transactions on the network. At the moment the focus is to test and stabilize the block production with real economics. The published blocks are empty for now. In about 3 months, sequencers will start publishing actual transactions. In that phase the network is still considered in alpha stage, but people can deploy privacy preserving smart contracts and make transactions. With the alpha stage, the focus is to make the whole Aztec ecosystem more resilient, improve the user experience and increase privacy and security by enabling forced transaction inclusion and run private RPCs. I think in the alpha stage anyone is allowed to run sequencers as well or stake their tokens. There is also a delegated staking functionality, which at the moment needs you to stake 200k Aztec tokens. No smaller stake amounts are possible at the moment. Maybe at the point of the alpha launch this changes. Overall, I am not a big fan of delegated staking as this normally speeds up sequencer centralization.</p>\n\n<p>As aztec is close to a based rollup it shares a lot of the trade offs with based rollups. The great thing is that it has a decentralized sequencer set from the start. Currently, there are about 100 individual sequencers publishing blocks. The disadvantage is that the block time is limited by Ethereum L1. So at most a block every 12s. Because publishing each block as a blob on L1 costs ETH, one wants to have the blob as full of transactions as possible. Currently the time between blocks is set to 72s, which is a trade off between the cost and the user experience. Might be that with the alpha launch this gets reduced to 36s, but it needs a governance vote to do that. As most of these blobs will not even be close to full for a long time, transactions will cost more than on &#39;normal&#39; rollups. This leads to a worse UX than other high performance rollups which have block times below 1s. I do not know if they plan to include preconfirmations in any way. This makes Aztec not that enticing for degen activities that need instant transaction confirmations and fast price updates, but it probably is a tradeoff necessary for decentralization and resilience of the network.
