days ago ~~u/alexiskev~~ u/alexiskef posted a screenshot of a Devconnect presentation about the Ethereum Interop layer and asked what it means for Ethereum. There were some links, but now the videos from the meeting got published. In short, the Ethereum Interop Layer is the goal to reconnect Ethereum mainnet and the various rollups and make them feel like one single chain again but with the scalability that rollups brought. They design it in a way that it is provider agnostic and does not rely on trusted or permissioned actors. There is also no custody necessary for any of your assets at any time by any third party. It uses account abstraction wallets (EIP-4337) to achieve this. They announced an experimental testnet at the meeting for wallets and dapps to integrate with. They deployed on Sepolia and a few rollups. They need to get feedback from integrators/users and audit their code before they can launch on mainnet. The more technical talk (2nd link below) explains how it works in detail and goes into the differences between the Open Intents Framework (OIF) and the Ethereum Interop Layer (EIL).

There were some links, but now the videos from the meeting got published. In short, the Ethereum Interop Layer is the goal to reconnect Ethereum mainnet and the various rollups and make them feel like one single chain again but with the scalability that rollups brought. They design it in a way that it is provider agnostic and does not rely on trusted or permissioned actors. There is also no custody necessary for any of your assets at any time by any third party. It uses account abstraction wallets (EIP-4337) to achieve this. They announced an experimental testnet at the meeting for wallets and dapps to integrate with. They deployed on Sepolia and a few rollups. They need to get feedback from integrators/users and audit their code before they can launch on mainnet.
