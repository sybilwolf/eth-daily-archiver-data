Maybe it's a good thing that the crypto tickers in the Apple stocks app is broken...\n\nAnyway, it's been a while since I made a post about what I'm doing investment wise. Well that's been for a reason. I was hoping to share some good news by about now, announcing I bought a house. Alas, that has not come to fruition. Here's what has happened. It has been a stressful journey but as is usually the case if you're responsible, all will be ok.\n\nSo let's go back to ~~Uptober~~ Octobear 1st. I had a sell plan, and I had my eyes on a property I liked, I just needed ETH to break above $5,500 and I'd sell 60% of my stack and run off into the sunset with a beautiful house next to a stream and some native forest here in the NZ countryside with some ETH to stake with Rocketpool for the long haul (income insurance for an AI dominated future!). We of course never hit $5,500. I was very stressed during the big collapse because I had just spent a good couple of weeks doing due diligence on the property and I really liked what I was seeing, but I was scared that someone else might jump in before ETH has its $5,500+ run... ETH of course never had its run.\n\nJust as I was losing hope, another property came onto the market. Much cheaper, this one I could afford at ETH above $3,800! It was smaller, but just as pretty as the first one. Besides, I'm in my mid twenties, I don't need more than 2-3 bedrooms! But ETH price kept dropping. I still had faith in new ATHs but one night, I asked myself, if there is indeed a bear ahead of me, would I really want to wait another 4 years for this? Sure, I'm cutting some serious losses selling at $3,800, but at least I can still progress with my life. I'd seen too many stories of relief after selling and regret for not selling in this subreddit. So one night, after hesitating for about 2.5 hours, hardware wallet in hand, I did it. My computer let out a loud ***Mooooooo*** and there we have it. 60% of my ETH was now USDC. Thank you CowSwap, but $3,800/ETH is a steal for some lucky buyer (I still think this today in the bigger picture).\n\nBut I didn't feel relief. I just shattered my own 8 year long dreams of a $10K ETH and all the money that would've made me. Worse yet, literally the next morning I was hit with a 5% green candle and all i could feel in my stomach was dread and regret. Over the next few days, price rallied up another 10%. Worse still, my employment situation changed and all of the mortgage lenders suddenly would no longer lend to me. The house is now out of reach and I'm out of position with my investment opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nPain.\n\nDespite the pain, I knew better than to try and make short term decisions with money that would take me years to make back from savings. So I sold it for NZD in a bank account. That way I would avoid making terrible, emotionally driven decisions to try and trade. I had made my bed and for better or worse, I needed to sleep in it.\n\nOne month later, here we are. I have mixed feelings about everything, but I am less stressed financially than I have been in literal years. I am sad about the houses I missed out on, but others will come once I get a new job. I am sad that I have less ETH than ever. But, I am also less stressed than ever, and for the first time, I will be able to buy back ETH at a discounted rate if it goes low enough that I feel buying ETH is better than continuing the house hunt (after paying a whopping 33-39% income tax on my gains of course \ud83e\udd74). The threshold for me will probably be around $2K. Whether or not we hit that level is very much to be seen, I just know that $2K ETH is an absolute firesale to the likes of $200 pre-2021. Even $2,700 is fucking juicy.\n\nBut to close, make sure you have some cash on hand to weather out the worst case scenario bear and general life expenses. Nobody wants to be forced into selling everything at bear market lows. ETH fundamentals have never been more bullish, but it seems like we might have to wait a few years before we have our own NVIDIA moment. Despite the pain, this is not a bad thing. In the long run most of us will be financially better off from buying the dip. Speaking of buying the dip, as a 2017 $300 ETH buyer, I never thought I would ever DCA ETH from my salary ever again after 2021. I was wrong about that. I will be buying below $3K, there is no doubt about that.\n\nAnyway, I hope you have gained something from my personal update and ramblings. **There's probably a few morals here and a TL;DR.**\n\n- Don't over-trade, I'd have been utterly rekt if I bought back in after the house fell through (tax bills a year from now would've been killer if ETH doesn't recover by then). Edit: In fact, bonus tip, always keep cash on hand to pay your tax liabilities as you incur them. It sucks, but you can lose ***huge*** amounts of money if you don't.\n\n- Don't be scared to take some serious chips of the table if you're in the green. I was scared for 8 years and it just wasn't worth it.\n\n- If you're not in the green, keep DCAing if you can and believe in the fundamentals. At the end of the day, more pain now means more gain later.\n\n- My favourite 2 wei is don't ever sell everything. Why? Well, even if ETH did go to $10K after the Octobear crash, I'd still have gained something by not selling everything. If I did sell it all and that happened, the pain would be unbearable. So just keep some skin in the game as regret insurance.\n\n- NZ is definitely beautiful and all that, but the job market here kinda stinks. And I work in our biggest industry with lots of options...","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey fam, rough day, huh?
