If you're plan was always to wait until end of year to sell, then stick to the plan :) It totally sucks that prices haven't continued to go up as we thought they would through the end of year but, for all we know, this could just be another (big) drop before the final cycle high.

That way you don't go off track, or get influenced by the interim, as strong as the influence to sell now is. If the price was still high then you would probably still wait until year end to sell, right? So you could view the current price as noise and you can take your informed decision at year end, which was always the plan. \n\nHere's my attempt of an analogy for your situation: When you're out on a walk/ hike, you have an end destination; you usually have a pre-planned route to reach that end. There are usually a lot of rocks and rivers that you have to get over. Sometimes it's pretty tough (and on some of the hikes I do, sometimes pretty scary), but you don't turn back around, because then you wouldn't reach the end. It's just the noise in the interim, and it feels awesome at the end.\n\nI'm saying all this without any knowledge where price will be end of year, but hopefully it offers a different perspective, which can be awfully hard to see during depression. Whatever you do, I hope you're okay. Depression f'ing sucks, but there's always nicer times ahead.\n\nP.S. My plan was also to wait until end of year to sell.

To understand how this is planned to be done we have to look at how Ethereum works today. At the moment each Ethereum block has to be evaluated by every Ethereum node in the world. This means they all have to re-run all the transaction in the block to make sure that they all agree on the new state of Ethereum (who owns which assets on chain). There are about 10k-20k Ethereum nodes, each re-running all the transactions. Ethereum wants to be properly decentralized, so we need to make sure that the blocks are not too big, so nodes running on consumer hardware can verify the blocks in the time necessary to participate in the network. But bigger blocks would mean more throughput (more transactions per second). This tradeoff between consumer hardware which allows for the decentralization but at the same time does not allow to go for maximum scaling is what limits Ethereum in terms of scaling mainnet. Other chains do not want to have this tradeoff, so they only run in data centers on very beefy computers and there are sometimes only a handful of nodes actually properly attesting that a certain block is valid. \n\nNow, with the hard work of all the zk teams there is a probable way to have a very decentralized network, which still has a throughput rivaling those of very centralized chains while still being resilient, permissionless, trustless and censorship resistant. The way to achieve this is as follows: Imagine only one node in the network would have to run all transactions in the block and they could then prove in a very short way (the key word is 'succinct') to the other nodes that all transactions have been applied correctly. This proof would be structured in a way, that the creator cannot cheat in any way. All the other nodes could then just take this proof and not have to re-run all transactions to verify that the block is correct. This would make it possible to ahve much bigger blocks and in turn have a much higher throughput without without booting the nodes running on consumer hardware off the network. One can even lower the hardware requirements, as you do not really need a fast CPU or a lot of disk space anymore, you could even run a validating node on a smartwatch (slightly exagerated, but directionally correct). This is exactly what zk proofs can deliver. There is one disadvantage though: you need someone to create such a proof. Creating the proof is computationally intensive, which potentially centralizes that part of the Ethereum network. Currently, the fastest zk proving setups have hardware which costs $50k-$200k, not something you as a consumer can have in your house or garage. That is why there is a massive push towards optimizing all the code involved in creating the proofs to get them more efficient and use less and cheaper hardware. The recent tweet by Justin Drake points to an important milestone which the zksync airbender team has achieved. They run one of their provers on 2 consumer GPUs (RTX5090) which are plugged into a consumer PC (AMD Ryzen 9 9950) with 128 GB of RAM. Still a beefy computer which costs $5k-$10k, but you could get it in many places in the world and plug it in at home and start creating zk proofs. You can also rent this type of hardware for a few dollars per day on various marketplaces. It is pretty accessible. This setup is just not yet fast enough to create the proofs in the 12 seconds needed, it takes on average around 17s, but that is pretty close. It is also the cheapest setup to currently produce proofs at $0.0024 per proof. At the beginning of the year the cost was in the $0.1-$5 range and it took several minutes to half an hour to create a proof. With further advances, one is potentially able to bring the costs down further, increase the proofing speed and most importantly keep the hardware requirements on a consumer level. The amazing thing is that you actually only need 1 entity to create such a zk proof for the Ethereum network to still work and keep all its properties. As long as the hardware cost is low and the rewards are high enough there will always be enough people to run such a prover. \n\nI left out a lot of nuance in this post, especially around adding this new prover responsibility into the Ethereum network and possible centralization vectors and fallback mechanisms if all provers would fall off the network. As far as I see most Ethereum researchers and core devs are aware of the issues and are working on ways designing the protocol in a way to prevent this from happening. I think there is enough room to design it in such a way to achieve the goal, it does not happen automatically however. There is also the question how do you run your node in such a future as your node knows that the state of Ethereum is correct but it does not know what the state actually is. Or in other words, to be able to use your node to read the current state of Ethereum and send transactions, it either needs to re-run all the transactions (i.e. a beefy machine) or we need good ways to create/distribute parts of the state in a trustless manner. As far as I understand discussions to achieve this are happening now.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>In the short term and for most users there is no relevance of what Justin tweeted, but in probably 2-3 years, the zk proving tech that is being developed might make it possible to scale Ethereum by a factor of 100x to 1000x from what we have today, while keeping most of the decentralization or even improve it. To understand how this is planned to be done we have to look at how Ethereum works today. At the moment each Ethereum block has to be evaluated by every Ethereum node in the world. This means they all have to re-run all the transaction in the block to make sure that they all agree on the new state of Ethereum (who owns which assets on chain). There are about 10k-20k Ethereum nodes, each re-running all the transactions. Ethereum wants to be properly decentralized, so we need to make sure that the blocks are not too big, so nodes running on consumer hardware can verify the blocks in the time necessary to participate in the network. But bigger blocks would mean more throughput (more transactions per second). This tradeoff between consumer hardware which allows for the decentralization but at the same time does not allow to go for maximum scaling is what limits Ethereum in terms of scaling mainnet. Other chains do not want to have this tradeoff, so they only run in data centers on very beefy computers and there are sometimes only a handful of nodes actually properly attesting that a certain block is valid. </p>\n\n<p>Now, with the hard work of all the zk teams there is a probable way to have a very decentralized network, which still has a throughput rivaling those of very centralized chains while still being resilient, permissionless, trustless and censorship resistant. The way to achieve this is as follows: Imagine only one node in the network would have to run all transactions in the block and they could then prove in a very short way (the key word is &#39;succinct&#39;) to the other nodes that all transactions have been applied correctly. This proof would be structured in a way, that the creator cannot cheat in any way. All the other nodes could then just take this proof and not have to re-run all transactions to verify that the block is correct.
