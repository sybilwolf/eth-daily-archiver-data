All the other centralized exchanges had a dip, but it was much smaller than on Binance (35%). On Kraken it was 5%, on Bybit it was 8%, on Deribit it was 2.2%. On Ethereum itself there was, less than a 0.01% depeg on Curve. There was USDe liquidity, but no way to bring it to Binance. To conclude from that that there was an issue with USDe itself is a bit much. Or even claiming that the redemption mechanism of USDe was the issue like the OKX guy is saying is in my view very wrong. The redemption mechanism and backing is not that relevant on these timeframes as they cannot kick in that fast. The liquidity is more relevant and this apparently dried up on Binance within minutes.

I personally think that the crash got triggered on purpose and Binance was not able to withstand it. According to a Forbes article, someone sold $90 million USDe on Binance. This brought a depeg and triggered other issues in trading pairs and every Binance user who used USDe as collateral probably got margin called.

USDe might just have been a good trigger for the attacker because it did not have a massive liquidity on Binance and therefor an easy way to trigger the events which crashed the market.\n\nI guess I have to add here, that I never used USDe or touched Ethena.

I&#39;m not going to read all that, but here&#39;s my take on what happened: </p>\n\n<p>There was nothing wrong with USDe and it was never depegged market wide. It was a weakness in Binance being abused: Binance valued USDe (as collateral, margin balance etc) not using proper oracles, but simply at the price at which it was trading on their own exchange. Which then was exploited by some entity market selling a huge amount of USDe on Binance, causing the price (only on Binance) to crash, causing a lot of people&#39;s balance to be calculated too low, causing their positions to be liquidated and a following liquidation cascade that then rippled through the whole crypto market.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does USDe have enough usage to cause this sort of carnage?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Has like 7 billion TVL so it is quite big, yes. Heavily used in DeFi.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why is it always a shitty algorithmic stablecoin fucking up the market</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not a shitty stablecoin fucking up the market, but a shitty centralized exchange ... also a recurring pattern.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-11-23 18:30:43","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-11-23 18:35:25","id":"nqeavyc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1p4f6xr","parent_id":"t1_nqe51pk","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Stobie","body":"This was all discussed at the time.
