He is a lawyer at coincenter and has been doing his work in the Ethereum space since 2016. He is fighting for onchain privacy and helps defending Roman Storm. His talk focused on a very specific topic: Can transparent systems remain neutral? Or in my words: Can Ethereum stay credibly neutral, censorship resistant and permissionless while being transparent? His answer is 'no'. He then gives the example of Swift, a messaging layer for interbank transactions established in 1973 in Belgium. It was designed to be neutral. It facilitated transactions to entities which many other countries did not like, but everyone agreed that neutrality was necessary. Over time the neutrality slowly got eroded by political powers until first sanctions against Iranian banks were implemented in 2012 and then Russian banks in 2014. In other words it took political powers about 40 years to corrupt Swifts neutrality. And because swift can see all the messages, it can easily censor whatever it is politically forced to do. Valkenburgh then goes over to Ethereum and says that privacy on Ethereum needs to be on the base layer if neutrality is something that we want to keep alive. Otherwise political powers will slowly erode this neutrality until it does not exist anymore. I agree very much with his framing of the problem.  \n\nThe Ethereum foundation recently started to explicitly focus on privacy by establishing the PSE (Privacy Stewards of Ethereum), a research and development group within the EF. Privacy is more than just sending ETH around anonymously. It means being able to mint and sell tokens and NFTs anonymously. It means being able to vote in elections or DAO decisions, it means being able to freely access the Ethereum network through RPCs without leaking your full info to them or your wallet or being blocked by anyone involved in the process.

Each of these stakeholders has some influence over the the protocol, but it is really impossible to quantify how much.
