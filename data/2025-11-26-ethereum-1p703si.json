For example without being a rollup on Ethereum, the single sequencer of Base could easily censor you. They could also hold your funds hostage by just switching off their sequencer. There would be no way for you the do anything against this. But Base is a Stage 1 rollup and this comes with certain properties for you. You can force the rollup to do certain things, even if the sequencer does not want you to do these things. Or in other words, only thanks to Ethereum is Base a permissionless, censorship resistant and trustless solution.

Even though Polygon POS, the blockchain on which Polymarket runs, is coupled to Ethereum by regularly posting state roots to Ethereum. But unlike for Base, this does not mean that Polygon POS inherits any security from Ethereum. So strictly speaking, Polymarket does not need Ethereum. But Polymarket profits from running on a transparent blockchain (Polygon POS) which makes it possible to prove that their prediction markets are all running orderly without preferential treatment of some participants. This is unlike other prediction market like Kalshi or sportsbetting apps. In the long run the goal still is for Polygon POS to become a rollup on Ethereum, similar to Base.
