The genesis set is rather small (200 entities) and only allowed 1 million tokens per entity. Not sure if it is worth it to try to subvert the public vote to lock the tokens. They could try, but it would get rather expensive. Sequencers also get the tokens staking rewards which would be unlocked as well. So these entities would lock these rewarded tokens as well even though they have to pay fees on Ethereum to stay a sequencer. \n\nFor other early investors which have a lot more than just 1 million tokens per entity it could make more sense to lock them as they have a much larger token allocation to protect. But to be honest if the vote for unlocking fails I would expect for the Aztec as a project to take a large reputational damage and the future token price would get less valuable as well. If all tokens would be locked, the aztec foundation could not really give grants to important projects to develop on Aztec or efficiently design incentives. This would massively diminish the token value down the road. In my view Aztec has 1 or 2 years to show that there is enough interest in a privacy preserving rollup with Aztecs design. If that fails,l the token will be worthless. Not being able to finance this growth is a surefire way to fail. Or in other words I do not see any incentives to lock the tokens, because no matter how I look at it looks suicidal to me. But hey, we are in crypto, we have seen the wilder things. \n\nWould definitely be interested if you find anything about these addresses though.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Would be surprised if this was the case.
