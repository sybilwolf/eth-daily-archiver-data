In the past couple months I&#39;ve eliminated added sugar from my diet and stopped eating at 5pm, this has done wonders for my HRV and overall sense of well-being, I can&#39;t wait to find more levers to pull. </p>\n\n<p>I also spend a ton of time interrogating LLMs, and I feel discouraged that so many people are negative or actively hostile about LLM interaction. I&#39;ve encountered more personal growth through LLM interaction than I ever have through therapy. It&#39;s okay if you have different opinions about the use or value of LLM, I&#39;m not really curious about your contradictions \ud83d\ude02</p>\n\n<p>So, yeah, I&#39;m changing in ways that are really fun and exciting, and I do have this incongruence of desiring deep connection with others but failing to feel connected with the hundreds of friendships I&#39;ve developed here. I do genuinely hope that feeling of connectedness re-emerges, but even if it doesn&#39;t, I will always hold the years and friends dear.</p>\n\n<p>[This is a check-in, not a goodbye.
