Approaching my 5 year anniversary as an Ethereum core Shitposter. \n\nBack in 2021, the consensus of Ethereum was POW. EIP 1559 hadn\u2019t been implemented. The idea of POS and 1559 were just that, ideas. \n\nIn late 2025, these are realities. Ethereum accomplished the biggest update in the history of blockchains with the Merge and did so without suffering any downtime. Between that and 1559 Ethereum also set the foundation of its monetary policy. \n\nIn 2021, scaling was an unknown, and the biggest problem in the room. Scaling while maintaining Ethereum\u2019s decentralization was still in concept development. L2s didn\u2019t exist. \n\nThe decentralized scaling of Ethereum has begun in earnest since then, with the launch of L2s, blobs, and now gas limit increases. The future of this endeavor has crystallized and has honestly never been brighter than it is now with progress on ZK. \n\nIn 2021, real regulation around blockchains hadn\u2019t begun. (In the US, idk about elsewhere). We were faced with legal attacks from the government in the months/years that followed. The idea of an average citizen being allowed to interact with the Ethereum L1 wasn\u2019t a sure thing, and we were already seeing specific smart contracts sanctioned and blocked. \n\nIn 2025 Ethereum is legal. It is being discussed in the chambers of government all over the world. It is being ruled upon favorably (mostly). We still see sanctions of smart contracts and certain things that need to be better but it is massively improved from where I started. \n\nIn 2021 DeFi was old, NFTs were new, and the only people playing with crypto were crypto folks, degens, and scammers. Stablecoins existed and were neat within crypto. Little did we know that the first real time stablecoins would enter the mainstream consciousness would be a year later with the Terra Luna collapse.\n\nIn 2025 all those same people are here but so are institutions. DeFi is still old for us but it\u2019s brand new to Wall St. Stablecoins have been broken, learned about, and now have found product market fit all over the world. They\u2019re *the* crypto story of this year, and adoption and acceptance look incredibly promising. And again, it\u2019s never been more clear that all of this is happening and will happen on Ethereum. \n\nBig picture? After 5 years I\u2019ve never felt more confident in my thesis on *Ethereum*, the network. We are winning everywhere. Adoption is up only. I can\u2019t envision a world where blockchain is widely used and Ethereum the network isn\u2019t the big winner. Between the inherent decentralization, development prowess, and modularity of its architecture I see no reason for alt L1s in 2025. It\u2019s Ethereum, or it\u2019s nothing as far as I can tell. \n\nThat all being said, big picture, ETH the asset has severely underperformed my thesis as of today. Unfortunately for myself and others like me, we aren\u2019t here for the tech. We are here for the price (mostly). Maybe it\u2019s less honorable or whatever but it\u2019s true and ETH the asset needs people like me just like it needs the tech enthusiasts. \n\nI still believe that ETH is severely mispriced. I still believe network value will accrue to token value. I do believe in 10K+ ETH still in the next 18 months. In 2021 you could buy sub-3K ETH. But all the development that has happened since were just ideas back then. Hype can return quickly. Gradually, then all at once. If there is a gold rush to build on ethereum, to use ethereum by the largest institutions in the world they\u2019re going to need shovels. For the AI gold rush those shovels were Nvidia GPUs. For the Ethereum gold rush the shovels are ETH. \n\nBullish the next 5 years, but also ready to see my positivity reflected in the price.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Been here since early 2021.
