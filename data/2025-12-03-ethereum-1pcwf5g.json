It is an added difficulty for decentralizing rollups, especially at the beginning when there are only a few transactions on rollups and one has to pay in ETH to get blobs on Ethereum mainnet. Luckily mainnet transactions are cheap at the moment, which is bad for the burn, but very good for trying to decentralice nascent rollups. Like most ETH bulls I do not like to let go of my ETH too easily, but I also believe privacy is a fundamental right. Sometimes ideologies might cost you and I put Aztec in that bucket for me. Took me some time to be sure to participate as a genesis staker. In my internal balance sheet, I have written off the tokens, makes it easier to handle the uncertainty of what they might be worth in a year.  \n\n> The plan is keeping an eye on chain metrics, blockspace demand, TVL and see if this has actual product market fit.\n\nI am really curious how they will develop in the next 1-2 years. This is the time for me to see if the have product market fit.\n\n> The token really only grows if there is an increasing blockspace demand, met by growth of sequencers, offsetting the rewards...

This could change if they introduce burning and depending on how they introduce it.\n\nNot much to add here, except that as they use account abstracted wallets they can use many tokens as gas tokens, even Aztec tokens. With proper staking the tokenomics for the Aztec token is better than for many other rollup tokens, but that does not make it automatically robust against months long incentiviced yield farming promotions. \n\n\n> Overall it is a bet on Ethereum being waaay better off by having a composable privacy plugin.\n\nSending a selected number of tokens privately is great but if you can have it for more than simple transactions it can unlock much more. No idea if the addition of composability alone is good enough to bring a lot of projects onto Aztec. Maybe at the beginning people just want simple transactions to be private and then Aztec is a massive overkill. With time, projects taking advantage of the composability will emerge and find product market fit. I certainly hope so. In the very long run I agree with a devconnect talk I mentioned [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p59cva/daily_general_discussion_november_24_2025/nqhzsm1/) a few days ago, that a credible neutral layer needs privacy to stay neutral. To stay neutral simple transfer privacy might be enough, so even in such a future Aztec might give an additional value.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>On a more fundamental aspect, running a sequencer means letting go of ETH in exchange for AZTEC, which goes against my fundamental value view on staking tokens, especially because Aztec is very ambitious but also a very risky bet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>100% agree here. It is an added difficulty for decentralizing rollups, especially at the beginning when there are only a few transactions on rollups and one has to pay in ETH to get blobs on Ethereum mainnet. Luckily mainnet transactions are cheap at the moment, which is bad for the burn, but very good for trying to decentralice nascent rollups. Like most ETH bulls I do not like to let go of my ETH too easily, but I also believe privacy is a fundamental right. Sometimes ideologies might cost you and I put Aztec in that bucket for me. Took me some time to be sure to participate as a genesis staker. In my internal balance sheet, I have written off the tokens, makes it easier to handle the uncertainty of what they might be worth in a year.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The plan is keeping an eye on chain metrics, blockspace demand, TVL and see if this has actual product market fit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am really curious how they will develop in the next 1-2 years. This is the time for me to see if the have product market fit.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The token really only grows if there is an increasing blockspace demand, met by growth of sequencers, offsetting the rewards... There is no burn and no usage as gas token, but some governance on it too. So more akin to ETH pre-burn but swapping gas token utility for the expected high value of governance on a Stage 2 (which is a phenomenon we havent seen anywhere because no other L2 has had so much alignment in incentives as Aztec does). This could change if they introduce burning and depending on how they introduce it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not much to add here, except that as they use account abstracted wallets they can use many tokens as gas tokens, even Aztec tokens. With proper staking the tokenomics for the Aztec token is better than for many other rollup tokens, but that does not make it automatically robust against months long incentiviced yield farming promotions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Overall it is a bet on Ethereum being waaay better off by having a composable privacy plugin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sending a selected number of tokens privately is great but if you can have it for more than simple transactions it can unlock much more. No idea if the addition of composability alone is good enough to bring a lot of projects onto Aztec. Maybe at the beginning people just want simple transactions to be private and then Aztec is a massive overkill. With time, projects taking advantage of the composability will emerge and find product market fit. I certainly hope so. In the very long run I agree with a devconnect talk I mentioned <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p59cva/daily_general_discussion_november_24_2025/nqhzsm1/\">here</a> a few days ago, that a credible neutral layer needs privacy to stay neutral.
