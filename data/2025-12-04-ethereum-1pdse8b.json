I am not over the hill just yet, but it is far from life threatening now. Just had another acute episode in my chronic disease. Can happen any time, but did not have one in 5 to 6 years and it therefore is always a bit shocking when it happens. It is not painful or anything for which I am very thankful. My quality of life suffers in various other ways though. But now to the Ethereum part. One of the advantages for me to be in Ethereum the way I am is that it lets me choose my own daily schedule. No deadlines to fulfill, no stressful resource limitation or profit maximization discussions no office politics, just pure fun when I want it. And most importantly I can just let things be for a few days, lie down and sleep when demanded so by the chronic disease. This massively helps to counter the quality of live reductions that comes with it and maybe even reduce the chance of acute episodes occurring. No way I could maintain this high level of quality of live in any traditional job. In addition the returns from Ethereum investments also lets me improve my quality of live massively during acute episodes. I cannot buy health directly and for buying the best doctors I miss two zeros in my balance sheet. But I cannot overstate how big of a difference it makes having a few 10k set aside which you can just tap in in case I need a room upgrade (yes that exists in our health system) for quieter nights or even have access to more doctors (that one is ethically so wrong that this option even exists, but it does...). In other words Ethereum has made my world so much better in more ways than just one.  \n\nWill probably delete the personal part in a few days as one should publish these kind of things online, but I thought it was quite fitting with the still very surprising doots milestone.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>What?
