And states have specific rights and authorities with regard to banking and securities regulation on top of that. And insurance - an important financial sector - is regulated almost exclusively at the state level. The division of labor at the federal level is an interesting quirk of political history and there are good arguments to be made that you should combine the SEC & CFTC, remove regulatory and supervisory duties from the Fed and devolve all of those into an FDIC that absorbs the OCC. That's not the structure we live in. \n\nIn other countries banks and financial firms, and the government regulatory apparatus, are far more concentrated and centralized. For example, in the UK the FSA was already a fairly centralized regulator but post-crisis they further consolidated responsibilities in to the FCA. By comparison, in the US we eliminated one \"banking\" regulator by rolling it into the OCC and we created a brand new federal consumer regulatory agency which was given authorities that previously belonged to banking regulators.\n\nOn the face of it, you'd think that's a recipe for inefficiency and a hindrance to attracting financial activity. But the reality is that despite all of that, the United States' global dominance in financial markets went unchallenged for about half a century. I'm not arguing that regulatory structure is the reason - I'm saying the US regime somehow worked in \\*spite\\* of that convoluted and frankly illogical design. (I cannot and will not deny that the US position as a dominant non-financial economy and trade center is a critical element here as well but High Street was the dominant finance powerhouse for a long time after the US became such a formidable economy). \n\nHere's how I read that signal - regulation is good. The global community likes our capital regulations as much as they envy our global dominance. Our markets are the world's flight to safety in the event of market stress. I think that is because a long history of careful iteration of our financial laws, consistent interpretations of that law based on hard-nosed analysis, fairness in the interpretation and execution of those laws for economically equivalent activities and a mandate for disclosure-based regulation, not merit-evaluation. I think we have rolled those regulations back too far, to our detriment. To the detriment of our public markets as they shrink into an ever growing opaque and private market. To the detriment of competition among banks dominated by 10 firms that account for  more than 60% of US banking assets. I would personally like to see much stronger reforms of the existing system and I think it's a better plan than throwing the baby out with the bathwater.   \n  \nI think regulation and the SEC in particular has to drive competition, eliminate rent-seeking, prevent fraud, protect market stability and provide transparency while also iterating slowly, remaining consistent in its interpretation of all of its laws and regs, aggressively pursuing its congressional mandate and the interpretation of the law as currently established by SCOTUS decisions, being as forward-thinking as possible in order to establish rules that are durable to an evolving sector and in constant contact with all stakeholders in the financial markets. Sometimes those goals conflict with each other and you're always making hard decisions about priorities and where to land on the spectrum under the eye of intense political scrutiny and far more transparency than private actors, consistently incomplete information, and heavy resource constraints. \n\nYou said: *I can't believe it's too much to ask to get sound regulation from an impartial regulator who is simply trying to protect the interests of the every day investor from even just one of the two parties.*\n\nI know you disagree but I believe down to my bones that I and we did our absolute best to do exactly what you're saying.
