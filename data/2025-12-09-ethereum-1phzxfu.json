But from the outside, a lot of the SEC's actions look functionally indistinguishable from a protection racket for incumbent wealth. Even just the core paternalistic accredited investor regulations guarantee that retail cannot access the gains and class mobility from speculation on innovation, they are protected from that, it is preserved for incumbent wealth which is a key driver of the wealth inequality cracking the very foundation of our society today. \"Wait for the initial pleb offering to get dumped on by all the firms the SEC commissioner will be working for next year after his terms up peasant, you're too stupid and poor bred to be allowed risk\". \"Only those heavily regulated systemically important firms (that require cyclical bailouts with your tax dollars) can be trusted with risk and its rewards\". Crypto routed around that. A bunch of people in this very forum used their brains, learned this stuff early, took the risk, and made life changing financial gains bootstrapping what is now a multi trillion dollar industry without being part of the club and while being actively attacked by the establishment you represent. Ever since the SEC has systematically attacked the space and done everything in its power to cut off that avenue for retail. ICOs; rather than taking a rational approach to prevent fraud and help retail like Hester Peirce's safe harbor plan, just attack at random, stoke fear, provide zero guidance so everyone is afraid to do an ICO. Now projects can only raise capital from VC sharks that farm retail with endless vaporware with immediate liquidity to dump on them.

But from the outside, a lot of the SEC&#39;s actions look functionally indistinguishable from a protection racket for incumbent wealth. Even just the core paternalistic accredited investor regulations guarantee that retail cannot access the gains and class mobility from speculation on innovation, they are protected from that, it is preserved for incumbent wealth which is a key driver of the wealth inequality cracking the very foundation of our society today. &quot;Wait for the initial pleb offering to get dumped on by all the firms the SEC commissioner will be working for next year after his terms up peasant, you&#39;re too stupid and poor bred to be allowed risk&quot;. &quot;Only those heavily regulated systemically important firms (that require cyclical bailouts with your tax dollars) can be trusted with risk and its rewards&quot;. Crypto routed around that. A bunch of people in this very forum used their brains, learned this stuff early, took the risk, and made life changing financial gains bootstrapping what is now a multi trillion dollar industry without being part of the club and while being actively attacked by the establishment you represent. Ever since the SEC has systematically attacked the space and done everything in its power to cut off that avenue for retail. ICOs; rather than taking a rational approach to prevent fraud and help retail like Hester Peirce&#39;s safe harbor plan, just attack at random, stoke fear, provide zero guidance so everyone is afraid to do an ICO. Now projects can only raise capital from VC sharks that farm retail with endless vaporware with immediate liquidity to dump on them.

They don't really have the unique concept of a \"security\" for example. Their financial regulatory apparatus is far more consolidated and to be overly honest, they just don't currently have the regulatory influence over global financial markets that the US does. I take issue with using the word \"audit.\" Nothing in the GENIUS Act requires stablecoin issuers to undergo audits in the way we use the word for the way a public company is audited. Even policies that makes some iterative improvements can, taken as a whole, result in worse outcomes. In other words to me the costs of the adopted policies outweigh the benefits. \n\nUltimately - I think the EU financial regulatory regime just isn't comparable enough with the US regime for that to be an apples to apples evaluation. Maybe we shouldn't have three bank regulators and two markets regulators with distinct but overlapping jurisdictions and mandates. But we do. \n\nThe generally accepted description of commercial banking in the US is an entity that takes deposits, makes loans, and (or) offers checking accounts (which is now more broadly understood to mean 'facilitates payments'). There is an ongoing debate over whether or not you have to engage in all three to be a bank or if offering any individual core service makes you a bank. The industry tends to argue both sides, depending on what is in the interest of their business at any given time. And I think it's also worth noting that in addition to heightened regulation, being conferred with a bank charter comes with a LOT of privileges. I will agree that we've lost the plot on bank charters more broadly as well as the activities that are described as \"incidental to banking\" which has allowed traditional banks to operate far outside what I consider to be the law's intended design parameters. That said, I think stablecoin companies are taking deposits and facilitating payments and that makes them a bank in my book. And I take that view consistently - I don't believe money market funds should be allowed to exist without banking charters. That arrangement is ultimately the quirk of a DoJ memo explaining they wouldn't pursue charges against MMFs which left them under the purview of the SEC. But they're very similar to narrow banks, they essentially offer deposits, and you can actually make payments from MMF accounts. That's banking activity if you ask me. \n\nBut your last point gets to the bottom of all of this for me. Nothing about the technology makes it impossible for stablecoin companies to operate under the same regime as other electronic payments providers and I have not seen a coherent explanation for how this specific deployment of \"crypto\" can be differentiated from any other digitized financial ledger. I also don't get the desirability of creating private money given its track record over the course of history. And I also take issue with the claim that stablecoin technology is revolutionizing the payments rails when it greatest desire is to glom onto the existing Federal Reserve-provided payments rails that do not use stablecoin tech.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Missed this, bookmarking for response</p>\n\n<p>Edited with response:</p>\n\n<p>I think MiCA is insufficient and also it&#39;s important to acknowledge that the regulatory schema in the EU is way different than the US.

In other words to me the costs of the adopted policies outweigh the benefits. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately - I think the EU financial regulatory regime just isn&#39;t comparable enough with the US regime for that to be an apples to apples evaluation. Maybe we shouldn&#39;t have three bank regulators and two markets regulators with distinct but overlapping jurisdictions and mandates. But we do. </p>\n\n<p>The generally accepted description of commercial banking in the US is an entity that takes deposits, makes loans, and (or) offers checking accounts (which is now more broadly understood to mean &#39;facilitates payments&#39;). There is an ongoing debate over whether or not you have to engage in all three to be a bank or if offering any individual core service makes you a bank. The industry tends to argue both sides, depending on what is in the interest of their business at any given time. And I think it&#39;s also worth noting that in addition to heightened regulation, being conferred with a bank charter comes with a LOT of privileges. I will agree that we&#39;ve lost the plot on bank charters more broadly as well as the activities that are described as &quot;incidental to banking&quot; which has allowed traditional banks to operate far outside what I consider to be the law&#39;s intended design parameters. That said, I think stablecoin companies are taking deposits and facilitating payments and that makes them a bank in my book. And I take that view consistently - I don&#39;t believe money market funds should be allowed to exist without banking charters. That arrangement is ultimately the quirk of a DoJ memo explaining they wouldn&#39;t pursue charges against MMFs which left them under the purview of the SEC. But they&#39;re very similar to narrow banks, they essentially offer deposits, and you can actually make payments from MMF accounts. That&#39;s banking activity if you ask me. </p>\n\n<p>But your last point gets to the bottom of all of this for me. Nothing about the technology makes it impossible for stablecoin companies to operate under the same regime as other electronic payments providers and I have not seen a coherent explanation for how this specific deployment of &quot;crypto&quot; can be differentiated from any other digitized financial ledger. I also don&#39;t get the desirability of creating private money given its track record over the course of history. And I also take issue with the claim that stablecoin technology is revolutionizing the payments rails when it greatest desire is to glom onto the existing Federal Reserve-provided payments rails that do not use stablecoin tech.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-12-10 13:06:34","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-12-10 15:29:50","id":"nta7ij2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1phzxfu","parent_id":"t1_nt5znww","score":2,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/GandalfGandolfini","body":"A narrow bank model, which Genius act stablecoins effectively are, is objectively better for payments for everyone except the incumbent banking oligopoly business model.

You guys see that, you find it, and you go \"oh, yeah, thats a hole we missed.\" And you plug it. And then the ball is back in the court of the bad actors again. The SEC got it 90% right the first time. After the \"leak\" is plugged? You're at 91%. Then 92%, each time the bad actors find a way to skirt, and the SEC improves again, and the bad actors find the next one, and you plug it, and so on and so forth. You'll never get to 100%.
