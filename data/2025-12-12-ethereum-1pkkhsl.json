Delivering on upgrades is only one way to judge the success of the network. And it\u2019s important. But for ETH to really accrue value TVL is the no. 1 metric to look at. \n\nIf you look at the TVL chart it follows the ETH price pretty reliably over 5 years. DEX volumes and active addresses paint a similar picture. \n\nIn short, for ETH price to go up we need more people to use Ethereum. We need more money on Ethereum. All the upgrades to the protocol are to increase these metrics. ETH gains value when more people are using Ethereum, using ETH as collateral. And if you look at these metrics, they haven\u2019t justified a higher price for ETH than what we saw in late 2021. Yet. \n\nThe network because of the upgrades has never been more capable of hosting the activity we want it to host. There are so many news stories you read about \u201cpilot programs\u201d for a ton of \u201cpotential activity\u201d  that have started\u2026 but for ETH to go up the demand associated with those things *actually existing irl at scale* is what is needed.
