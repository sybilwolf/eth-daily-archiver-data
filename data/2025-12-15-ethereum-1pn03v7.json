But they can't directly take people's ETH, obviously, so they're encouraging people to part with it through manufactured market forces via clever use of derivatives.\n\nTo spell out the playbook explicitly:\n\n* Wait until it's finally easy and legal for you to trade crypto and crypto derivatives as an institution without regulators breathing down your neck (mid-2025).\n\n* Gradually buy a massive amount of physical ETH while hedging it in equal measure with synthetic shorts to suppress price and stay delta-neutral (ETH's uniquely deeply liquid DeFi and CME futures markets - you can't do this playbook with any crypto other than ETH).\n\n* For a steady income stream, vary the amount of synthetic shorts you roll over each month. Inject just enough liquidity for a sucker's rally, get retail to buy high, let your net long position print. Pull enough liquidity to cause retail panic, get retail to sell low, let your net short position print. All the while, you're building up more and more physical ETH while playing the markets with more and more paper ETH (Q3/Q4 2025).\n\n* Once retail is disillusioned and most people believe ETH price action will never recover, load up on the synthetic shorts for a final shakeout that lasts months to years. Buy more and more physical ETH from retail as the synthetic shorts keep your position delta-neutral and suppress upwards price action, fulfilling the \"ETH PA will always be terrible\" narrative and getting retail to further capitulate into your physical buys. Bonus points if it's during a rough period of macro. <-- We are here\n\n* When retail is shaken out, you have as much ETH as you want, and ETH liquidity dries up completely, then simply let your futures expire all at once. This causes a massive liquidity shock that's everyone else's problem since your position is physical while other institutional players are still holding paper, trying to cover their ass with contracts that are only as good as their counterparty's ability to avoid bankruptcy.\n\n* Now you hold a ton of ETH, retail holds very little of the ETH, ETH price is high due to the liquidity shock, and other \"passive player\" institutions are trying to source ETH at any price to fulfill derivatives contracts and avoid bankruptcy. Now you start publicly endorsing ETH, point to the recent incredible price action, and say that you're loading up on ETH because it's the future - which is a lie because you already loaded up months or years earlier. You tell everyone that today's ETH is nothing like the ETH that had that terrible price action years ago - after all, the entire global stock market is settling on it now, blob burn is now substantial and consistent, and it did 300% from $3k to $9k in the past 2 months. Getting this narrative to catch on is super easy, because narratives always seek to explain price action. Retail loves to buy when the price is high, right after a huge run.\n\n* Retail buys again, creating a retail bubble. Now you sell to retail at $12k-$20k and buy your superyacht.\n\nRight now, 2025, is the perfect timing to execute this plan. Everything is lining up right now in a way that it never has in the past.\n\n* The stock markets are at ATH on AI steroids, causing capital owners to be flush with cash to play the markets.\n\n* The economy is in the shitter for the 99%, so it's extremely easy to apply pressure on retail to get them to part with their ETH for living expenses, layoff worries, and recession worries.\n\n* Recent changes in US law make it easier than ever for institutions to trade crypto and derivatives, along with \"crime becoming legal\" for elites who have big money and US political ties.

If you were a large capital owner, I think you would honestly be kind of stupid to not execute this playbook. It's free money, and it ensures that any capital that retail managed to gain by buying ETH early gets capitulated and flows back to the capital class.

But as soon as liquidity dries up fully on exchanges and it starts to catch a natural bid, that's when the shorts get lifted and we fly imo.
