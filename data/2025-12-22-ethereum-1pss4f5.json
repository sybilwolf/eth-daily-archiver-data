Bitcoin didn\u2019t dominate because humanity suddenly became enlightened - it dominated because it had relentless advocacy, nonstop narrative pushing, charismatic promotors, and constant repetition of one simple message: \u201cnumber go up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile Ethereum sat around patting itself on the back for being technologically superior while letting Bitcoin absolutely own the mainstream narrative. The price action speaks for itself. Bitcoin didn\u2019t just outperform ETH - it steamrolled it, cucked it, and walked away with the global mindshare crown. That didn\u2019t happen by accident. It happened because Bitcoin marketed itself, aggressively and unapologetically.</p>\n\n<p>Sitting back saying \u201cwell the smart people will find it\u201d is not a strategy. It\u2019s complacency. It\u2019s arrogance. And it\u2019s exactly the mindset that let ETH get buried in the first place. Retail doesn\u2019t care about philosophical essays on credible neutrality. They care about upside, conviction, and confidence - and ETH advocates failed to deliver that.</p>\n\n<p>Ethereum doesn\u2019t need fewer advocates - it desperately needs more. Louder, bolder, confident ones. If the ETH community keeps pretending humans will magically educate themselves into adoption while BTC continues to dominate the narrative war, then don\u2019t be surprised when Ethereum keeps lagging.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-12-22 23:10:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nvga5nt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1pss4f5","parent_id":"t1_nvcz481","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/ro-_-b","body":"I think it might range 4x higher from current levels in a couple of years.
