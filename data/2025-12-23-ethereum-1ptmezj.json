Hasn't been for years. Around the Merge and the enabling of withdrawals there was a lot of hype. Everything was going up and people wanted to stake. Everyone had their investment thesis for these tokens and as long as it was going up each month everyone was vindicated. Then the music stopped and people lost a lot of money. Now, for more than a year, staked ETH has been pretty much flat. As many people are leaving staking as are entering. I personally see this as healthy. But it also means there is very little growth in the space, at most some churn from one type of stakers to new ones. It is not only the RPL token, but all the staking tokens have lost a lot since the hype around staking died down in 2023. Lidos LDO is down by a factor of 10, Stakewises Swise token is down by a factor of 35, even more than RPL, even though stakewise had a pretty successful product launch at the end of 2023. \n\nFor more than a year now people can run rocketpool minipools without having to buy RPL, which does not help to keep the token price up. The goal was to have many minipools which will then migrate to the newer megapools once they are live in February (maybe?). Once these megapools are live, staked RPL will earn some protocol fees in ETH. Or in other words, stake RPL, earn ETH. It will be a slow process migrating existing pools to the newer ones and some will probably never migrate. The success of the RPL token hinges on how many stakers open up megapools and more importantly how many people buy/use rETH. If there is no growth in rETH demand, megapools will only ever be a small fraction of the whole protocol, which limits the revenue for RPL stakers. \n\nFor me, rocektpool still is the most decentralized and permissionless liquid staking protocol. Nothing even comes close to that. Ethereum without Rocket pool would be a much more centralized chain. Rocket pool is far from perfect and some of the design decisions have been and still are biting them. I personally hope they will deploy megapools soon and manage to find large (institutional) buyers who go for rETH as their LST. If that happens, RPL price could recover at least some.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Staking is just not the hot thing anymore. Hasn&#39;t been for years. Around the Merge and the enabling of withdrawals there was a lot of hype. Everything was going up and people wanted to stake. Everyone had their investment thesis for these tokens and as long as it was going up each month everyone was vindicated. Then the music stopped and people lost a lot of money. Now, for more than a year, staked ETH has been pretty much flat. As many people are leaving staking as are entering. I personally see this as healthy. But it also means there is very little growth in the space, at most some churn from one type of stakers to new ones. It is not only the RPL token, but all the staking tokens have lost a lot since the hype around staking died down in 2023. Lidos LDO is down by a factor of 10, Stakewises Swise token is down by a factor of 35, even more than RPL, even though stakewise had a pretty successful product launch at the end of 2023. </p>\n\n<p>For more than a year now people can run rocketpool minipools without having to buy RPL, which does not help to keep the token price up. The goal was to have many minipools which will then migrate to the newer megapools once they are live in February (maybe?). Once these megapools are live, staked RPL will earn some protocol fees in ETH. Or in other words, stake RPL, earn ETH. It will be a slow process migrating existing pools to the newer ones and some will probably never migrate. The success of the RPL token hinges on how many stakers open up megapools and more importantly how many people buy/use rETH. If there is no growth in rETH demand, megapools will only ever be a small fraction of the whole protocol, which limits the revenue for RPL stakers. </p>\n\n<p>For me, rocektpool still is the most decentralized and permissionless liquid staking protocol. Nothing even comes close to that. Ethereum without Rocket pool would be a much more centralized chain. Rocket pool is far from perfect and some of the design decisions have been and still are biting them. I personally hope they will deploy megapools soon and manage to find large (institutional) buyers who go for rETH as their LST. If that happens, RPL price could recover at least some.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-12-23 20:25:49","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nvlqkzw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1ptmezj","parent_id":"t1_nvjvptw","score":21,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/edmundedgar","body":"> For more than a year now people can run rocketpool minipools without having to buy RPL\n\nNice, I didn't know this.
