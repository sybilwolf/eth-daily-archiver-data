New vehicles, especially reliable one's like Toyota's, are often 2-6 years out and sold above MSRP pushing everyone that would buy new into the used market.\n\nUber really broke it, too. Used to be able to find tons of reliable cars with low km for under $10K, and lots of still good cars in the $3K-$5K range. Every used car under $10K now has 400k km on it and comes with a list of huge problems the seller admits to, so probably a lot more they're keeping secret. If you can find a $5000 car today it's got nearly 500k km on it and doesn't start. Anyone getting their first vehicle is completely screwed, I don't think teens even drive anymore.\n\nI paid $15K for a 2013 with 50,000km and 1y warranty (that bought me a new transmission) back in 2017. Back then that was already a financially dumb decision. But today with 250,000km+ they're still being sold for $15K. Mine has under 180k on it and I've babied the interior so I could likely sell it at a profit today, after 9 years - which is insane.\n\nUsed high-km 2020+ models are selling for maybe $4000 under new. But come with no warranty, unusually high km, and a host of problems. If you finance this you'll get at best 6% APR. Or you can buy new for $4000 more at 0% APR from the dealer, with a 3-5 year everything warranty, and over the loan duration pay less. I can't justify buying anything now, but the logic for buying new makes sense in this scenereo.\n\nShit, half the time you buy/sell a used vehicle anymore the person tries to scam you. Either demanding a large deposit or paying half and then disappearing with the goods. This NEVER happened prior to 2020, but if you're serious about buying used today and see even 5-10 people it might happen multiple times. Some people don't want or shouldn't try to navigate that, so they buy from the used car lots that sell at inflated like-new prices because they'd go bankrupt if they didn't if they bought any inventory at peak insanity.\n\nIf you make $150,000 a year you can barely afford a $30,000 vehicle. Nobody thinks this way! People making $30,000 a year are buying or worse leasing these like no big deal. Maybe 50% of the traffic I see are driving massive $100,000+ trucks, so people just inherently assume a $1700/mo 9% 9y loan payment is normal and justified if it means they get to keep up with the Joneses.

I still won't touch 99%+ of the used vehicles for sale now, they are too far gone. It's always going to be cheaper to repair my car, swap the engine/transmission/everything than to buy something else. Mine could be the last car I ever own the way things are going. Even basic parts are often months out with an extreme markup, making typical fixes out of question or otherwise financially bad decisions.\n\nSometimes an old person dies and their $20K vehicle goes to auction with $30K in receipts of work done, then sells for $10K because it's not saught after by the audience for some reason or another.
