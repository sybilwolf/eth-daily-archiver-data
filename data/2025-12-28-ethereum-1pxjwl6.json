I'm eighty-four years old and no one is going to listen to me anyway.\n\nYesterday it was auto insurance, today is health insurance in the US.\n\nOne of the Super Mario Brothers already taught you that health insurance only exists for profit, you already knew that, but I want to share my take.\n\nTo begin with, health insurance companies literally do not give one flying fuck whether you live or die. Seriously. \"Life saving procedure\" means nothing to them, only the profit margin. \n\nTo use an auto insurance metaphor: in health insurance, your body is the car. Your insurer doesn't care about the car, they don't care if you sell it or trade it, they don't care what model it is or how long you plan to keep it. They don't care if you change the oil or do regular maintenance, and they sure asf aren't going to pay for that. They only care if you pay your premiums and file claims. To reiterate: health insurance companies do not care about your body. Please, accept this and internalize it. \n\nHealth insurance companies look forward about ten years to figure out how much you're going to cost them. \"Preventative health\" is NOT about your health and longevity, it's about minimizing future claims. Don't trick yourself into thinking that preventative health is about keeping you healthy- it's about keeping you cheap. \n\nHere's the contrast: most of us want to live to be 80+ years old. To do that, you'll need to leave the rails of traditional health insurance a bit, and this confuses tf out of every provider and pharmacy in the US. They ONLY know how to interface with insurance companies and not people.\n\nYour doctor has most likely been deeply ingrained in the insurance process and may be completely unable to see outside of it. It's normal and okay. If you can help them see outside of it, many will with your permission, but some simply can't. \n\nWhere I see this the most: if you have any kind of long term condition, especially a heritable trait for something like cancer risk, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease, etc, your doctor is only going to look at a ten year frame of reference because that's what health insurance companies want. You need to convince them to look at the 80+ year lifespan and begin addressing those factors while you're young BEFORE they sneak up on you and kill you real fast. \n\nHealth insurance companies WILL NOT pay for these theeapies because they're not profitable. They will say, \"this isn't a problem right now, why should we treat it?\" If you know it's going to kill you in 35 years, you need to begin addressing it NOW. \n\nThis is where we get to paying: health insurance will not pay for long term protective therapies, but doctors and pharmacies [in the US] will almost ALWAYS offer a HUGE self-pay discount, usually 70%+. This is because prices are inflated because health insurers only pay a small percentage of the actual price thanks to negotiations. This means the sticker price looks REALLY expensive to you, while the insurer is paying pennies. YOU can get these prices too if you just ask nicely BEFORE the procedure. You just say, \"Hi, I'm self-pay, can you offer a self-pay rate?\" The only reason this might be hard for them is that they hardly ever get asked to do it. \n\nWhy this matters: If we're going to live long and healthy lives, we have to recognize the true motive of the health insurance industry and advocate aggressively for our own health.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m going to ramble.
