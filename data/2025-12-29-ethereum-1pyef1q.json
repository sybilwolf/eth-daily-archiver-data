Nobody does this to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is allowed to be valued purely on narrative: digital gold, macro hedge, store of value, number go up, done. No one demands a spreadsheet proving economic productivity or a constant justification of revenue output to validate every price level. Meanwhile ETH is forced into a productivity box where price must always be \u201cearned\u201d through transactions, fees, and measurable output, as if it is a corporate stock rather than the monetary base of the largest smart contract platform on earth.\n\nThis mindset quietly suppresses ETH\u2019s ceiling. It conditions the market to believe that ETH cannot be allowed to appreciate without proving itself utilitarian enough every step of the way. That is completely backwards. Scaling keeps usage cheap. ETH price reflects monetary importance, security, and role in global infrastructure. Stop shackling ETH with standards that Bitcoin never had to clear.

Note that you do this valuation of the entire life of the project (albeit time-discounted) so a short-term spike in the gas price might still be bad for the ETH price; Ideally we want to scale to really high transaction volumes, and take a really small amount of revenue from each transaction, and while we&#39;re still working on scaling transaction volumes we don&#39;t want to discourage usage with high fees.</p>\n\n<p>The thing people are saying isn&#39;t happening is, if the ETH price goes up, the transaction fee in real terms also goes up. The transaction fee would rationally be a result of how much benefit people are getting from their transaction, so if we&#39;re all making the same transactions but the ETH price randomly goes up 10x, we&#39;d expect the fee per unit of gas in ETH to drop 10x.</p>\n\n<p>This is easy to see if you think about a regular stock: If the stock price of MacDonalds goes up, that doesn&#39;t make the price of a Big Mac go up. Presumably even in some bizarro world where you paid for Big Macs in MacDonalds stock instead of dollars, they&#39;d still base the price on its value in dollars since that&#39;s what affects how much the customer is willing to pay. But if MacDonalds can double the price of a Big Mac and still sell the same number of them, that&#39;s great for the MacDonalds stock price.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2025-12-29 23:38:09","distinguished":null,"edited":"2025-12-29 23:49:04","id":"nwmwldn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1pyef1q","parent_id":"t1_nwmub3c","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/ChefsPlatterMagik","body":"\"The transaction fee would rationally be a result of how much benefit people are getting from their transaction, so if we're all making the same transactions but the ETH price randomly goes up 10x, we'd expect the fee per unit of gas in ETH to drop 10x.\"\n\nThis sounds like you're in agreement.
