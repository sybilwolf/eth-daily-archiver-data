Basically, my first internal thesis milestone is reaching 1T in mcap (adjusted for inflation). To me, that's the first milestone to Ethereum becoming global financial infrastructure, because it says implicitly that Ethereum is highly valued as an asset and a network. So I would sell some there. \n\nThe next milestones for me are more based on utility than value, i.e. the first truly mainstream application on Ethereum. I take the same approach I took with Tesla when I invested in the early 2010s. Basically, I said I'd sell when I see Tesla's every day while driving. To me, these kind of usage milestones are easy ways of gauging market penetration for tech plays / growth assets. So I would sell some more if Ethereum achieved a dapp that was truly mainstream. Stablecoins are pretty close, but not quite there. If major banks were using stablecoins in their backend, then I might consider that a mainstream dapp. Or if Ethereum enabled 24/5 or 24/7 equities trading at scale, that would also quality. Something like that.\n\nFor me to sell and capitulate (thesis never achieved) it's a time-based milestone. If it's been a decade since my initial investment, and progress is obviously not happening as I expected it (network metrics are down, tech progress has stalled, crypto interest has waned, utlity is not there, social in-fighting, etc.) then I cut my losses and sell.
