Not been following the EIPs as tightly recently so this is a vibe guesstimate from me, ETH L1 is scaling well and ZK will make it mainstream and offer massive performance benefits. The mad men will pull it off.\n\nConsidering we have no solution for state bloat right now beyond just deleting  old state and maybe distributing it over the P2P network through PeerDAS with Verkle Trees in the distant future (not next year AFAIK), this isn't really good news. Ethereum right now has too high of a gas limit in my opinion, going 3x that is just going the route of Solana but with the EVM instead. Ethereum is the only real decentralized smart contract chain that also has users, celebrating the death of home stakers and full nodes as \"scaling well\" is not a good sign of its future and honestly makes me want to sell it for BTC (which for all its faults, including its failing security budget, is at least got a culture of ossification preventing this kind of stuff from happening).\n\nEDIT: While I'm on the sadly controversial topic of decentralization and censorship resistance, the pushback against FOCIL but acceptance of ePBS, halving slot times to 6s (which does very little for UX, BTC seems to do just fine with 10 minutes, but does make things even more difficult for home connections with high latencies and limited resources), and later centralizing block builders under the ZKP regime would make Ethereum *more centralized than Solana is right now*, as a handful of entities (currently Titan Builder, Buildernet (Flashbots), and Quasar are the big ones) would have full control over the block building of Ethereum with very high capital barrier to entry. The concept of FOCIL was to ensure that validators have full control over what transactions eventually get included onchain, but if it doesn't go through then long term Solana will be the most decentralized and credibly neutral smart contract network, not Ethereum (as sad as that sounds, given how centralized Solana is...).
