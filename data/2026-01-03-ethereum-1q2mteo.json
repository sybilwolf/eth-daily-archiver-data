But that's fine. \"Venezuela\", as in the Venezuelan people (not the narco terrorist regime aided by Russia, Iran, China) are not getting any of that oil money anyway, the industry has been largely run into the ground by socialist bullshit. Looking at it as the US just \"exploiting Venezuela for oil\" misses the whole economic uplift that comes with such an industry flourishing in a country, if done right. In any case, it will be better than what they have now.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the things Trump rambled about is that they (his military henchmen) are going to \"run the country\" for an unspecified length of time and that their plans for installing the next native government specifically did not include Maria Corina Machado, which it absolutely should. She won the Nobel prize for a reason and is **the** person that should be at the head of this revolution. \n\nBut still, Maduro gone is the most important step numero uno and it's very hard to imagine the situation turning out *worse* for the people than it was before.

That\u2019s a big jump for a single grocery item. The irony is that while everyday goods keep getting more expensive, crypto prices are falling - even though the dollar itself is steadily losing value as inflation persists.</p>\n\n<p>My guess is that retail simply has no spare cash left. When essentials cost more, buying crypto starts to feel like a luxury. Extra money that might have gone into investing is now being absorbed by groceries, fuel, and basic household items.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, cutting back on some discretionary spending would make more sense, but then do what - hold cash?
