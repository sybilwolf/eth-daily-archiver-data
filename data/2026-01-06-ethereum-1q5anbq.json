it's taken me a little while to upgrade my understanding on this, but I have some **good news** and I have some **bad news**. Well not too bad but effectively us 'exit queue is now zero' fanboys have a little longer to wait for it to be what we think it is.\n\nFrom what I can gather Ethereum has two queues when validators are leaving the beacon chain:\n\n* *The Exit Queue* is validtors queueing to leave the network. As far as I can tell they would still be validating during this time and considered active validators. They're in the queue to stop validation (?). Experts, correct me here if I'm wrong.\n* *The Withdrawal Queue* is for exited ETH to be returned back to the validators designated wallet.\n\nSo you first exit your validator and then there is a separate queue for you to receive your ETH. Why? I don't know fully, I haven't looked that deeply.\n\nBut what it does mean, crucially, **we still have some ETH to be withdrawn before we can say there's no overhang.** Some of you may already have known this but my own take was that there are now no more exits, meaning there's no naked ETH supply hitting wallets. This isn't the case and we have a bit longer to wait.\n\nBut how long?\n\n* According to [rated.network](https://explorer.rated.network/network?network=mainnet&timeWindow=1d&rewardsMetric=average&geoDistType=all&hostDistType=all&soloProDist=stake) we have 9d 19h 25m to go, and 329,254 ETH.\n* According to [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/validators/queues) we have 254,773 ETH to go, and they say 1d 3h 18m 24s.\n\nSo what's the reality? It's a blend of the two. It looks like the countdown timer on [beaconcha.in](http://beaconcha.in) is broken because you can't exit 254k ETH in one day, plus I've been checking that value over the last day or so and it hasn't moved. [rated.network](http://rated.network) only seems to update once a day, however I would say their countdown timer is accurate.\n\n**TLDR;** I'd say we have approximately 254k ETH to go and somewhere around \\~8 days until we're free of the overhang.\n\nThis doesn't bother me for what it's worth, we've had like 4 straight months of validator exits and we're still here, although *we're not quite there just yet.*","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>So it&#39;s taken me a little while to upgrade my understanding on this, but I have some <strong>good news</strong> and I have some <strong>bad news</strong>. Well not too bad but effectively us &#39;exit queue is now zero&#39; fanboys have a little longer to wait for it to be what we think it is.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can gather Ethereum has two queues when validators are leaving the beacon chain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Exit Queue</em> is validtors queueing to leave the network. As far as I can tell they would still be validating during this time and considered active validators. They&#39;re in the queue to stop validation (?). Experts, correct me here if I&#39;m wrong.</li>\n<li><em>The Withdrawal Queue</em> is for exited ETH to be returned back to the validators designated wallet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So you first exit your validator and then there is a separate queue for you to receive your ETH. Why? I don&#39;t know fully, I haven&#39;t looked that deeply.</p>\n\n<p>But what it does mean, crucially, <strong>we still have some ETH to be withdrawn before we can say there&#39;s no overhang.</strong> Some of you may already have known this but my own take was that there are now no more exits, meaning there&#39;s no naked ETH supply hitting wallets. This isn&#39;t the case and we have a bit longer to wait.</p>\n\n<p>But how long?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>According to <a href=\"https://explorer.rated.network/network?network=mainnet&amp;timeWindow=1d&amp;rewardsMetric=average&amp;geoDistType=all&amp;hostDistType=all&amp;soloProDist=stake\">rated.network</a> we have 9d 19h 25m to go, and 329,254 ETH.</li>\n<li>According to <a href=\"https://beaconcha.in/validators/queues\">beaconcha.in</a> we have 254,773 ETH to go, and they say 1d 3h 18m 24s.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s the reality? It&#39;s a blend of the two. It looks like the countdown timer on <a href=\"http://beaconcha.in\">beaconcha.in</a> is broken because you can&#39;t exit 254k ETH in one day, plus I&#39;ve been checking that value over the last day or so and it hasn&#39;t moved. <a href=\"http://rated.network\">rated.network</a> only seems to update once a day, however I would say their countdown timer is accurate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> I&#39;d say we have approximately 254k ETH to go and somewhere around ~8 days until we&#39;re free of the overhang.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn&#39;t bother me for what it&#39;s worth, we&#39;ve had like 4 straight months of validator exits and we&#39;re still here, although <em>we&#39;re not quite there just yet.</em></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-01-06 07:58:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nxz0p2l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1q5anbq","parent_id":"t3_1q5anbq","score":7,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/eth10kIsFUD","body":"You're telling me ETH is up and we haven't even gotten to the pad yet?\n\nAnd here I thought I couldn't' get more bullish, ETH is going to pump through the stratosphere!!","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>You&#39;re telling me ETH is up and we haven&#39;t even gotten to the pad yet?</p>\n\n<p>And here I thought I couldn&#39;t&#39; get more bullish, ETH is going to pump through the stratosphere!!</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-01-06 11:31:36","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nxznvvc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1q5anbq","parent_id":"t1_nxz0p2l","score":4,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Tricky_Troll","body":"Isn't this just validator withdrawal churn?
