The line turns more and more blurry and is shifting in one direction.\n\nIt's just op-sec at this point.\n\nDon't you remember the old times when attending a ethereum or crypto conference made you a potential target? Both for physical violence or state actors? We didn't know if crypto turns \"Anti-State\" as crypto undercuts the state as sole form of money authority, or what would happen.\n\nSuddenly we had indipendent options for money and nobody knew what it will turn out to, liberty to publish&fund against the state like the proof of the crimes against humanity like WikiLeaks videos that needed funding, or in line with state as they want taxes and \"you do your kids playtoy thing, pay taxes\".\n\n\nYou cannot speak freely if you fear consequences. Then the choice to speak is no longer free but conditional if you can suffer through the consequences and endure the price of it. And nowadays everything that you say can and will be used against you. Big Data isn't your friend.\n\nIf you need to argue why you need to say something you also are no longer in a free speech, you either have it or you don't - if you need to reason for it. That's like begging and being dependent.\n\nIn the old times there has been quite a clear mark what is \"too much\" but it was a global minimum what every nation agreed to. Everything else was okay. Now with global and realtime surveillance it's the maximum of censorship: if any country at any time has any limitation this can be applied to pretty much everyone. It's no longer the least common denominator (only what really everyone agrees) of the rules of nations, but globally the highest common factor: 1 maximal strict rulesets for everyone with the sum of all rules.\n\n\nQuite obviously the window of speech has shrunken in the past decades. Hence it's just a basics form of op-sec to minimize your attack of area. Don't offer cross-connections willingly.\n\n\nThe only logic thing to do.\n\nBetter would be a more granular approach, but we know Reddit has been enshittificated since the IPO and the bowing to shareholders. It started like always with porn reduction, reduced visibility, opt-in for visibility of it, and so on like the API carve out (with much much better 3th party competing apps of the free market).

The line turns more and more blurry and is shifting in one direction.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just op-sec at this point.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t you remember the old times when attending a ethereum or crypto conference made you a potential target? Both for physical violence or state actors? We didn&#39;t know if crypto turns &quot;Anti-State&quot; as crypto undercuts the state as sole form of money authority, or what would happen.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly we had indipendent options for money and nobody knew what it will turn out to, liberty to publish&amp;fund against the state like the proof of the crimes against humanity like WikiLeaks videos that needed funding, or in line with state as they want taxes and &quot;you do your kids playtoy thing, pay taxes&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot speak freely if you fear consequences. Then the choice to speak is no longer free but conditional if you can suffer through the consequences and endure the price of it. And nowadays everything that you say can and will be used against you. Big Data isn&#39;t your friend.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to argue why you need to say something you also are no longer in a free speech, you either have it or you don&#39;t - if you need to reason for it. That&#39;s like begging and being dependent.</p>\n\n<p>In the old times there has been quite a clear mark what is &quot;too much&quot; but it was a global minimum what every nation agreed to. Everything else was okay. Now with global and realtime surveillance it&#39;s the maximum of censorship: if any country at any time has any limitation this can be applied to pretty much everyone. It&#39;s no longer the least common denominator (only what really everyone agrees) of the rules of nations, but globally the highest common factor: 1 maximal strict rulesets for everyone with the sum of all rules.</p>\n\n<p>Quite obviously the window of speech has shrunken in the past decades. Hence it&#39;s just a basics form of op-sec to minimize your attack of area.
