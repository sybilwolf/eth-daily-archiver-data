It must support applications that are more like tools - the hammer that once you buy it's yours - than like services that lose all functionality once the vendor loses interest in maintaining them (or worse, gets hacked or becomes value-extractive). Even when applications do have functionality that depends on a vendor, Ethereum can help reduce those dependencies as much as possible, and protect the user as much as possible in those cases where the dependencies fail.\n\nBut building such applications is not possible on a base layer which itself depends on ongoing updates from a vendor in order to continue being usable - even if that \"vendor\" is the all core devs process.

Hence, Ethereum itself must pass the walkaway test.\n\nThis means that Ethereum must get to a place where we _can ossify if we want to_.

This means deciding, and implementing, whatever form of partial statelessness and state expiry will let us feel comfortable letting Ethereum run with thousands of TPS for decades, without breaking sync or hard disk or I/O requirements. It also means future-proofing the tree and storage types to work well with this long-term environment.\n* An account model that is general-purpose (this is \"full account abstraction\": move away from enshrined ECDSA for signature validation)\n* A gas schedule that we are confident is free of DoS vulnerabilities, both for execution and for ZK-proving\n* A PoS economic model that, with all we have learned over the past half decade of proof of stake in Ethereum and full decade beyond, we are confident can last and remain decentralized for decades, and supports the usefulness of ETH as trustless collateral (eg. in governance-minimized ETH-backed stablecoins)\n* A block building model that we are confident will resist centralization pressure and guarantee censorship resistance even in unknown future environments\n\nIdeally, we do the hard work over the next few years, to get to a point where in the future almost all future innovation can happen through client optimization, and get reflected in the protocol through parameter changes.

This means deciding, and implementing, whatever form of partial statelessness and state expiry will let us feel comfortable letting Ethereum run with thousands of TPS for decades, without breaking sync or hard disk or I/O requirements. It also means future-proofing the tree and storage types to work well with this long-term environment.</li>\n<li>An account model that is general-purpose (this is &quot;full account abstraction&quot;: move away from enshrined ECDSA for signature validation)</li>\n<li>A gas schedule that we are confident is free of DoS vulnerabilities, both for execution and for ZK-proving</li>\n<li>A PoS economic model that, with all we have learned over the past half decade of proof of stake in Ethereum and full decade beyond, we are confident can last and remain decentralized for decades, and supports the usefulness of ETH as trustless collateral (eg. in governance-minimized ETH-backed stablecoins)</li>\n<li>A block building model that we are confident will resist centralization pressure and guarantee censorship resistance even in unknown future environments</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ideally, we do the hard work over the next few years, to get to a point where in the future almost all future innovation can happen through client optimization, and get reflected in the protocol through parameter changes.
