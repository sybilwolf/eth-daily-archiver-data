I have analog back-ups in a notebook that granddad gave me. Ink never forks. That's what he always said. Vridia told me the same.\n\nBut I don't know if I can do this. The relays were never meant to reunite anyone: they were built for bridging, to keep us moving. How long before I forget what I'm doing here?\n\nA registry scan flagged me for \"possible fork of existing user\". I told the relay guard that that was impossible. He just looked at me like someone who'd seen too many travellers returning as the wrong person.\n\nI might be fragmenting. I might have lost a page from my notebook. I can't find what I wrote about my search for my sister.\n\nInk is safe. Grandad told me that. *Ink can't fork*.

The more chains you use, the more fragmented you become.</p>\n\n<p>My identity pass says I&#39;m on a pilgrimage; that I&#39;m exploring chains on a voyage of self-discovery. But that&#39;s not the truth. The truth is that I&#39;m trying to find Vridia.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t store memories in-system any more. Too risky. Some chains overwrite. Others archive everything and charge you to forget. Safer not to.</p>\n\n<p>There are problems with not syncing, of course. I&#39;ve started finding signs that I&#39;m fragmenting. Small everyday things just seem a little off. Recognizing places that I know I&#39;ve never been before. Memories rendered wrong; not how I remember. And last week, a stranger walked up to me and called me by my sister&#39;s name. We don&#39;t even look alike. She&#39;s beautiful and confident and wild. I&#39;m just ... me.</p>\n\n<p>I think I might have met myself once, or at least someone who thought she was me. She told me that I&#39;d re-synched too many times, that my memories of my sister were just an integrity mismatch.</p>\n\n<p>I think she tried to delete me.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I am taking precautions. I have analog back-ups in a notebook that granddad gave me. Ink never forks. That&#39;s what he always said. Vridia told me the same.</p>\n\n<p>But I don&#39;t know if I can do this. The relays were never meant to reunite anyone: they were built for bridging, to keep us moving. How long before I forget what I&#39;m doing here?</p>\n\n<p>A registry scan flagged me for &quot;possible fork of existing user&quot;. I told the relay guard that that was impossible. He just looked at me like someone who&#39;d seen too many travellers returning as the wrong person.</p>\n\n<p>I might be fragmenting. I might have lost a page from my notebook. I can&#39;t find what I wrote about my search for my sister.</p>\n\n<p>Ink is safe. Grandad told me that. <em>Ink can&#39;t fork</em>. But I keep trying to find the words that I remember in the notebook and now I&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s right. The handwriting is familiar but it says I&#39;m on a voyage of self-discovery. That&#39;s not the truth.</p>\n\n<p>The cover says &quot;Property of Vridia&quot; in faded ink. But how can my sister have my notebook? </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I forget why I started. The more chains you use, the more fragmented you become.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-01-13 15:43:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nzdajfv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qbjlpk","parent_id":"t3_1qbjlpk","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/rhythm_of_eth","body":"> Ink can't fork\n\nI dunno mate, I would not put it past Kraken \n\nGreat story btw.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Ink can&#39;t fork</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I dunno mate, I would not put it past Kraken </p>\n\n<p>Great story btw.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-01-13 16:24:58","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"nzdjik9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qbjlpk","parent_id":"t1_nzdajfv","score":6,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/haurog","body":"Sorry, I have to nerd out here a bit, because I think it is an interesting topic.
