The max blob count increased to 21 per block with the BPO2 fork on January 7th. Ethpandaops looked at how high blob counts influence the correct head attestation of validators.

That does not sound good, but they then analyzed it further and looked at the block proposers. Some of them play timing games, which means they delay the publication of a block to increase the MEV capture. These timing games leave less time for the published block (and blobs) to propagate through the network. They grouped the block proposers into 3 groups (conservative, neutral and suspect) which reflects their timing game severity. Conservative ones do adhere to the standard protocol and publish blocks when expected, whereas the suspect ones delay to block proposal as much as possible. They found that blocks proposed by conservative proposers did not have any decrease in head votes even at very high blob counts, whereas suspect proposers saw a large reduction of head votes (5-7%). This means the network can handle large blob counts reliably, but node operators which are playing timing games will have to rethink how they do it, as missing head votes on their proposed blocks also reduces their revenue. No idea if the missing revenue from lower head votes is substantial enough to change their timing games though. It also means that planning for further blob count increases will have to account for these suspect actors as they are part of the network and the network resilience degrades faster due to their timing games. \n\nI guess the much lower MEV rewards block proposers get nowadays helps that the problem of timing games is not more widespread.
