Depending on your threat model, if you don't have one of these secured, then your privacy is very likely compromised in some way.\n\nI think a lot of people upon realising that, just take on a defeatist attitude since it takes more than just Tornado Cash smart contracts or a privacy focused L2 like Aztec to maintain one's full privacy. But despite being a long road, it's absolutely possible and I think the EF and your own re-focusing on privacy, VB, is a much needed call to action to tackle it once and for all. The tech is here, we just have to build it, make it (relatively) intuitive and make sure users know it is there \u2014 if they ever need it.\n\nI think the most important thing about privacy is not necessarily making sure it is used by all by default (would be nice), but making sure it is accessible to all *if they need it*. After all, most people under authoritarian governments don't have something to hide, so much as they wake up one day and they find the government suddenly says something normally benign about them now makes them an enemy of the state. Therefore it's important that they have secure, private alternative technologies to fall back on to keep their lives going until they can get to safety.\n\nPersonally, I think the hardware and OS level software side of things is most at risk from snooping authoritarian governments in the long run. Things like Chat Control in the EU and democratic backsliding in the US leaves us with very few places left where companies will be able to create open hardware and software which doesn't have backdoors.\n\nMy outlook for the Ethereum side of privacy is good, but I think we're quickly losing the battle for hardware and OS level software. Just look at the way Android is going with their sideloading restrictions. If we lose open source Android or devices with unlocked bootloaders to run custom ROMs on, then mobile is lost (Linux phones just don't have the app support). Living a normal life without a mobile OS is almost impossible these days, so we must defend this critical infrastructure. We are fast running out of time but I appreciate your renewed efforts on the Ethereum side of things.\n\nTo anyone reading this, the most you can probably do is to reach out to your representatives any time there is dystopian legislation [like Chat Control](https://fightchatcontrol.eu/) or privacy invasive age restrictions trying to be made into law.
