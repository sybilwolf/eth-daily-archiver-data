I&#39;m sure there are many reasons why they chose to build their own L1, they are certainly not the first. </p>\n\n<p>This is the problem with words like decentralization, they have many meanings. Yes, MEV is a problem with public blockchains because they have a public mempool. However, it&#39;s mitigated by tools like Flashbots protect, wallet private RPCs, and then app level tools as well (like batch auctions). </p>\n\n<p>But beside the point, MEV cannot be eliminated from ANY public blockchain. Once you have public state and transaction ordering of any kind, you have extractable value.  Even if you eliminated the mempool, validators can still choose which transactions to include!</p>\n\n<p>So you point to some L1 blockchain as the savior of a problem that cannot be saved! I find it incredible how people can spend so much time talking about crypto, and yet have no understanding how something basic like MEV is inherent in public blockchain design.
