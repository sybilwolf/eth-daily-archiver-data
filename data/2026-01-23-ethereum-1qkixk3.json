Chief among these is redemption.\n\nBreaking redemption down, at the time of redemption borrowers are obligated to rebuy alETH at 1:1 ETH regardless of what they sold it for. Right now the alETH peg is at ~0.96. When v3 goes live then people with outstanding alETH debt will be repurchasing that alETH on a 12 week cadence until we either run out of alETH debt (token supply drops to zero) or the alETH peg is restored enough that no one is interested in redeeming any more. At 0.96 this basically translates to 4% profit to those in the transmuter every 12 weeks which is about a 16% APR the alETH borrowers will be paying to those in the transmuter on their loans until their the redemptions repay their loans using their collateral. If you have just been sitting on a cushy position on Alchemix for the last 4 years you may not be aware this is happening at all and probably didn't borrow from Alchemix expecting a 16% APR when you've been paying 0% APR for the past 5ish years.
