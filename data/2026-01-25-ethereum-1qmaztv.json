If I run a minority client I can always switch to the faulty majority chain, but the other way around is not always possible. \n\nIt also depends a bit how you want to use your node. If you need a reliable RPC node as well for running a rollup node or dapps, then geth is very often the first choice. If you mostly use it as a validator and only connect your wallets to it, then Nethermind, geth and Besu are similar. I personally would go with Besu because it is a minority client. Reth and Erigon are great for archive nodes, but are overall slightly slower than the other 3, this is especially true for Erigon. Erigon also has the 'minimal node' settings which just uses 400GB or so on your disk. Other clients (Nethermind and Besu) also started to have this feature though. But to be fair, your 8 TB disk is more than enough for all the clients in their full node configuration. There is also a newer execution client called Ethrex which is already running very stable, but is probably not yet available on dappnode.\n\nFor Consensus clients, Lighthouse still is all around a great client. It is not the most resource efficient one, but it runs very reliable. Unfortunately, it also is one of the most used ones nowadays that is why I do not use it anymore as a Consensus client, but it needs to be said, that reliability of the client distribution data is hotly discussed. I personally use Lodestar, which is a bit slow after a restart, but it works perfectly for me. Nimbus is the most resource efficient one, but at least in the first few weeks I would monitor it a bit more closely as on some hardware and some client combinations I still have some hiccups with it. But if there are no issues on your setup it is one of the best consensus clients there is. I recently also started using Grandine which just runs great and it seems a bit more resource efficient than Lighthouse. Teku uses the most resources overall, and Prysm has been a solid choice for many people as well. So for the consensus the differences aren't that big. \n\nOverall, the differences are not that big at least in my opinion, so choose whatever works best for you. I would suggest that you also setup the VPN for dappnode so you can access and debug it from anywhere. Also an email subscription through beaconcha.in is free and invaluable to get notified whenever your node is offline.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I personally make sure to use minority clients, not because I think my validators have any influence over the whole network, but rather because running a minority client gives me more choice if a majority client does have a consensus breaking bug which forks of into their own chain.
