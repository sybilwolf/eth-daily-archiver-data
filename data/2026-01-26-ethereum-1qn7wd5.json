That is why a redeposit is necessary. As mentioned by u/coregamer90, you get a so called ~~execution~~ express ticket if you have a minipool at the start date of saturn 1.

Rocket pool is getting much more capital efficient and running a rocket pool node can be more attractive than before. For me, rocket pool still is the most permissionless and decentralized liquid staking protocol. It is also the most attractive one as an pseudoanonynous node runner and fan of decentralization. This permissionlessness comes with some downsides though, like slightly lower yield for rETH holders compared to other staking setups, but the advantage is a higher resilience thanks to the decentralization of the node operators. The trickiest part for rocket pool is if the protocol is able to attract more rETH demand which is necessary to migrate many existing minipools to megapools, fund the development of the protocol as well as making RPL more attractive again. The last few weeks have been very promising, the rETH/ETH peg has been restored (like for most LSTs) and there is a healthy demand for rETH deposits.

For me, rocket pool still is the most permissionless and decentralized liquid staking protocol. It is also the most attractive one as an pseudoanonynous node runner and fan of decentralization. This permissionlessness comes with some downsides though, like slightly lower yield for rETH holders compared to other staking setups, but the advantage is a higher resilience thanks to the decentralization of the node operators. The trickiest part for rocket pool is if the protocol is able to attract more rETH demand which is necessary to migrate many existing minipools to megapools, fund the development of the protocol as well as making RPL more attractive again. The last few weeks have been very promising, the rETH/ETH peg has been restored (like for most LSTs) and there is a healthy demand for rETH deposits.

Even worse for Bitcoin is that it seems to be impossible to create a non-centralized privacy protocol on top of it. Bitcoin the 'payments network' carried the network for many years, but it died in 2017 when it became clear that scaling is not a goal for the bitcoin network. A slightly later narrative, the 'programmable shared database' never really picked up steam and died out shortly after with the advent of smart contract blockchains. The 'uncorrelated financial asset' narrative came and went without much impact. There was a short deviation towards the 'reserve currency for crypto' narrative for Bitcoin. Some bitcoiners argued that wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum were proof of the central function Bitcoin will have in the future of finance. Well, due to the limited programmability of the bitcoin network it is pretty much impossible to bridge Bitcoins to other networks without centralized entities which is why not many people want to use Bitcoin for that. The next two narratives are different type of store of value narratives: The 'inflation hedge' died in 2022 when as soon as we had a bit of inflation Bitcoin tanked like there is no tomorrow. Same now with the digital gold narrative. Even though the narrative has been around for a long time, Bitcoin just isn't digital gold for most of the marginal buyers. We will see if there is a shift again for the store of value narrative for Bitcoin now that digital gold seems to be dying. Because store of value and speculative asset are pretty much the only narratives left for Bitcoin. To be fair though, I guess most retail gold buyers are not the ones which want to store their value for decades using gold and they definitely do not do so in a non-custodial manner.
