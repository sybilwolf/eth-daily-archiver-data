I saw a lot of great community members leave after some time and I never understood why people do, but now I haven't posted in a while and understand why. It's not the sub, it's not the community, it's just that there's no other market that will drain your mental energy as much as crypto. After some years you just have to leave or at last \"touch some grass\" for your own sanity. And that's what I did the past couple of months, I picked up a new hobby (fishing) to disconnect from crypto a little bit. I think we all need something that really allows us to learn, grow, a rabbit hole and after basically 7 years of crypto there is a new one that I really enjoy. \n\nThat doesn't mean I am not following crypto anymore, that I have sold. I am still long ETH and I am here to summarize why: \n\n\\- The Ethereum pivot (I still think it is one, but I understand why some people say it's not) feels like it really changes the market's perception. Mainnet is cheap and scaling which is great to see. This leads to so many crazy news that imo aren't priced in yet. There's basically a new stable coin launching every day on Ethereum. In hindsight people will not believe how obvious the signal(s) was/were. \n\n\\- While all the metal buying is negative for ETH/ crypto right now/ in the short term, it shows one thing: (no) trust / decentralization matters. No single party can control gold. You can store it yourself so nation state can't take it away from you. This applies for both individual people who might buy gold coins and of course nation states. And while e.g. SOLs validator count goes down, ETH is decentralized as ever. Maybe blockchains aren't all on the same path and don't converge to the same design long term after all? Maybe Scaling a decentralized system is easier and better than trying to decentralize a high performance blockchain? \n\n\\- While I see ETH more and more as a long term play (e.g. 10-20 years, basically comparable to stock like Amazon, Google, etc. from the early 2000s to today) and don't expect a 10x in 4 years, I still see huge upside. Stock (e.g. NVIDIA) and metals (gold, silver) easily gain/ lose ETH's market cap in a day. Yes, ETH is not a micro cap anymore that can pump easily, it is maturing. But once it catches a bit, crazy returns are still possible. \"Asymmetric bet\" is something we don't read regularly anymore, but I still see ETH as one. All the crypto doom posting is just bear market things. \n\nAt the same time we have accept one thing: crypto is missing product. That's nothing new. But with all the hype that products like clawdbot etc. get, you can see that in other industries products that apparently can make a difference start popping up. Maybe all this agentic hype is just AIs defi summer. Maybe it won't go up exponentially from here on. But I wish there was more product innovation, stuff that really adds value to a lot of people. \n\nAnyways. I will not leave forever (same as a lot of the members that left do show up from time to time). I actually hope that I'll post a little more in 2026 because I still love this community!
