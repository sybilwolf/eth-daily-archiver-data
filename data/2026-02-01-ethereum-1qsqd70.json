Why buy a declining asset with terrible sentiment when you could make money buying a real business that can grow its cash flows? </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t mean to be rude to you, but I think you have way too much money in cryptocurrency for your own comfort and you should consider divesting into other asset classes. Crypto, like precious metals, should only be a small proportion of anyone&#39;s investment portfolio and should be rebalanced as needed. </p>\n\n<p>ETH has been a bad investment for anyone who&#39;s DCAed into it over the past 4 years. The only way it can reclaim its former price is if sentiment shifts, and you should sell when that sentiment shifts.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-02 01:41:53","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o32vfog","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qsqd70","parent_id":"t1_o32u6me","score":-2,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/jtnichol","body":"https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMi1jb3B5_04730a4f-03b2-4138-ae98-ba26f4c1134e","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMi1jb3B5_04730a4f-03b2-4138-ae98-ba26f4c1134e\">https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMi1jb3B5_04730a4f-03b2-4138-ae98-ba26f4c1134e</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-02 02:51:21","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o337rfi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qsqd70","parent_id":"t1_o32vfog","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/sqtr-","body":"Bought some here.
