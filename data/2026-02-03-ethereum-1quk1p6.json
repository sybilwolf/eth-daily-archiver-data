I don't think CB would scoff at having their treasury reserves audited regularly or having to report them. That doesn't seem to be what the banks are talking about however. The banks are talking about making it a legal requirement to deny stablecoin holders the interest on the reserves which has nothing to do with disclosures, limits, and oversight.\n\n> I don't have anything public I can cite and I am not going to dox myself.\n\nI can respect that.\n\n> However, Brian Armstrong\u2019s Jan 14 post and the Reuters article are an admission he killed the bill over third parties (CB) not being able to pay 'rewards'.\n\nA straight forward reading of that post seems to agree with me so I'm not sure why you bring it up. He wants Circle (the issuer) to be able to pay Coinbase (the distributor) incentives that they can then forward to the stablecoin holder as an interest rate on their deposit. This makes it look/feel like a money market fund or savings account and appears to be currently legal because the genius bill only prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying the holder of a stablecoin any form of interest or yield, not paying the distributor, application, or some other party. The banks want a do over.\n\nI think we agree we'd like legal clarity on exactly what happens when these things break. Something like pyUSD is legally clearer because its a bearer instrument to a trust whereas USDC puts you in the line of general creditors. But If the US government is defaulting on treasury bills, or Coinbase mints and somehow loses $1T USDC, how are you going to regulate something to bail that out? While that's a great discussion to be having it doesn't seem to be what the discussion on the Clarity act is actually about.\n\nGiven that the current legal landscape allows them to forward these rewards, why do you think this is a do nothing and win situation for the banks?\n\nHow would the proposed language in the latest version of the clarity act apply to something like LP bribes that we've been using in this ecosystem for 6 years? Are LPs holding tokens or performing a service providing liquidity for token swaps? Could the money go to application developers?\n\nWhat sections of the clarity bill actually attempt to clarify the failure scenario of a stablecoin like USDC? I'd like to be more informed on what the banks are proposing as a helpful alternative.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks for taking the time to write this out.</p>\n\n<p>My longer thoughts on how we can better use the treasury yield to promote stablecoin adoption are available <a href=\"https://tokenomicsexplained.com/treasury-yield/\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>We also recently had a discussion with Erica from Lead Bank on this topic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5RgAdLZnfI\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Backing into the main thing I take issue with: &quot;it\u2019s a coherent policy concern that hurts rural states&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t <em>care</em> that it hurts someone unrelated to the depositor. In the status quo the depositor is being harmed by being denied the yield on their money. So it&#39;s not so much the magnitude I care about so much as who are we protecting and is it ethical to harm the depositor to benefit someone else? I framed helping society at large in some amorphous way at the cost of harming an individual as socialism but if the label doesn&#39;t fit let&#39;s find one that does fit better.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>but then you need money-market-like disclosures, limits, and oversight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems reasonable if what we&#39;re talking about is reporting requirements and oversight on backing. I don&#39;t think CB would scoff at having their treasury reserves audited regularly or having to report them. That doesn&#39;t seem to be what the banks are talking about however. The banks are talking about making it a legal requirement to deny stablecoin holders the interest on the reserves which has nothing to do with disclosures, limits, and oversight.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t have anything public I can cite and I am not going to dox myself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can respect that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, Brian Armstrong\u2019s Jan 14 post and the Reuters article are an admission he killed the bill over third parties (CB) not being able to pay &#39;rewards&#39;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A straight forward reading of that post seems to agree with me so I&#39;m not sure why you bring it up. He wants Circle (the issuer) to be able to pay Coinbase (the distributor) incentives that they can then forward to the stablecoin holder as an interest rate on their deposit. This makes it look/feel like a money market fund or savings account and appears to be currently legal because the genius bill only prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying the holder of a stablecoin any form of interest or yield, not paying the distributor, application, or some other party. The banks want a do over.</p>\n\n<p>I think we agree we&#39;d like legal clarity on exactly what happens when these things break. Something like pyUSD is legally clearer because its a bearer instrument to a trust whereas USDC puts you in the line of general creditors. But If the US government is defaulting on treasury bills, or Coinbase mints and somehow loses $1T USDC, how are you going to regulate something to bail that out? While that&#39;s a great discussion to be having it doesn&#39;t seem to be what the discussion on the Clarity act is actually about.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the current legal landscape allows them to forward these rewards, why do you think this is a do nothing and win situation for the banks?</p>\n\n<p>How would the proposed language in the latest version of the clarity act apply to something like LP bribes that we&#39;ve been using in this ecosystem for 6 years? Are LPs holding tokens or performing a service providing liquidity for token swaps? Could the money go to application developers?</p>\n\n<p>What sections of the clarity bill actually attempt to clarify the failure scenario of a stablecoin like USDC? I&#39;d like to be more informed on what the banks are proposing as a helpful alternative.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-05 00:01:05","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3ml2bu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1quk1p6","parent_id":"t1_o3kr5uu","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"author":"u/majorpickle01","body":"The US interest in stablecoins is exactly the same as the idea with the eurodollar - it furthers US economic hegemony. \n\nThey don't give a shit if they pay yield to those holding dollars, stablecoins are a way to make people that traditionally cannot easily access USD or treasuries have access, say sanctioned companies or those with poor infra.

That just shows how much hot air is there thats begging to get deflated. The entire industry addresses virtually nothing in terms of real world GDP. There&#39;s some potential here and there, but that apart there&#39;s not a single application with real world non-gambling use case that crypto caters to. </p>\n\n<p>On top of it crypto has a massive fraud and scam problem that has never been addressed at any serious level. You could setup a full time crypto prosecution office working round the clock and even they wont find time to prosecute all the various scams and frauds going on. Some of the largest players in the industry like Binance are outright scammers and conmen, running every shady playbook possible to milk the market. Trump, a generational conman, adopted crypto has his piggy bank to dip his hands into whenever he feels like, and came in at the top to suck out few billions for him and his cronies, who openly boast they have made few billions from crypto.
