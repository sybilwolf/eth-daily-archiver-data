This means quite a few L2s have now a sizeable number of transactions on them. Just a year ago, Ethereum mainnet did around 15 UOPS, which is similar to what unichain did yesterday. Some of the increased activity is definitely due to the ETH price going down which forces people to position themselves better and arbitragers to arbitrage the prices. This is very true for Arbitrum, and a bit as well for Base and Unichain. They have an increased activity in the last 2 weeks. For all the other L2s I do not see a strong increase in the last 2 weeks, but a rather slow and steady growth over a long time. Not sure if some activity for Unichain can be explained by yield farmerin though. MegaETH has, as far as I know, still not fully launched yet, so I guess the UOPS numbers for MegaETH are not really organic.

I think this is the key. To bring on more creators, and make fans feel better about getting their creators more money. Win win. Playing around in my head ideas that all content would be free or you can pay. If claimed for free, as you consume the media, the creator would get the rewards streamed and if you pay it's streamed to you.
