Gavin Wood, one of the co-authors, was in the process of leaving Ethereum around that time, leaving the other author, Andreas M. Antonopoulos, on its own finishing the book. Antonopoulos even sought the help of the Ethereum community to bring the book over the finishing line, which they did. For a long time, this book was a very good resource for me to understand the technical basis of Ethereum, even though it got more and more outdated as Ethereum progressed and changed out its plumbing over time. \n\nNow, with the 2nd edition release it is probably one of the best resources to find information about the technical underpinnings of Ethereum. The book covers pretty much everything from the basics like wallet creation and tokens to various DEFI protocols, cryptography, smart contracts, consensus mechanism, scaling and even zk-proofs. I have not read this new edition yet. But from a swift glance it looks great. I do not expect this book to cover everything in depth. It also did not back then, but it was great to cover enough to then go on from there on your own.\n\nYou can read the book online for free or get a hard copy in a store.

However, on the daily time frame it is now swinging back upwards, so BTC price will probably improve over the next couple of weeks (before the sell pressure gains momentum again).</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-06 15:42:25","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3x2cr3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qx9o40","parent_id":"t1_o3wffm3","score":3,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/Elendron","body":":<","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>:&lt;</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-06 12:35:31","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3w3oy0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qx9o40","parent_id":"t1_o3vmxif","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/remche","body":"Ethereum\u00a0","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Ethereum\u00a0</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-06 06:03:59","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3uutrq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qx9o40","parent_id":"t3_1qx9o40","score":23,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/FrenktheTank","body":"1936.82","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>1936.82</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-06 06:31:54","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3uy6hr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qx9o40","parent_id":"t1_o3uutrq","score":13,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/TimbukNine","body":"0.02923","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>0.02923</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-06 07:08:28","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3v2fms","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qx9o40","parent_id":"t1_o3uy6hr","score":10,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/Samdogg93","body":":(","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>:(</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-06 18:38:22","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3y3kon","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qx9o40","parent_id":"t1_o3uy6hr","score":1,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]}]},{"author":"u/smidge","body":"Well at least we went towards 1k daily comments again huh","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Well at least we went towards 1k daily comments again huh</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-06 12:17:09","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3w11h3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qx9o40","parent_id":"t3_1qx9o40","score":20,"stickied":false,"replies":[]},{"author":"u/abcoathup","body":"**Ethereal news weekly #10**  \n\n* Vitalik: role of L2s has changed\n* Hegot\u00e1 upgrade headliner proposals\n* Lido v3 live  \n\n[https://ethereal.news/ethereal-news-weekly-10/](https://ethereal.news/ethereal-news-weekly-10/)","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Ethereal news weekly #10</strong>  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Vitalik: role of L2s has changed</li>\n<li>Hegot\u00e1 upgrade headliner proposals</li>\n<li>Lido v3 live<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereal.news/ethereal-news-weekly-10/\">https://ethereal.news/ethereal-news-weekly-10/</a></p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-06 13:04:47","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3w8aep","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qx9o40","parent_id":"t3_1qx9o40","score":22,"stickied":false,"replies":[{"author":"u/abcoathup","body":"Double figures (it's actually the eleventh issue as started at 0).  \nUpvotes, subscriptions greatly appreciated to support a new newsletter.","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>Double figures (it&#39;s actually the eleventh issue as started at 0).<br/>\nUpvotes, subscriptions greatly appreciated to support a new newsletter.</p>\n</div>","created_utc":"2026-02-06 13:16:46","distinguished":null,"edited":false,"id":"o3waayp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_1qx9o40","parent_id":"t1_o3w8aep","score":8,"stickied":false,"replies":[]}]},{"author":"u/wsb_degen_number9999","body":"It seems like Tom is insinuating that the recent -40% crash is due to the unwind of silver blowing up.\n\nOne of his replies includes a tweet, which is guessing with some circumstantial evidence that some hedge fund from HK got blown up by silver trading and had to liquidate IBIT holdings.
