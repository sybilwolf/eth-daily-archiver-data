Thanks to client diversity, the network did not really struggle in any meaningful way. What is more interesting though is that such an incident can give us insights in how many people use a certain client. Before the incident, attestation participation was at around 99.8% after the incident, the attestation participation dropped to 94.5% within 4 epochs (~25 minutes). Or in other words, it looks like that around 5% of all validators are exclusively using nimbus as the consensus client.
