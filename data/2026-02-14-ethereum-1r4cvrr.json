The demand to borrow ETH is high, either because people are borrowing ETH to short it or they want to get all ETH off the market in a hurry.\n2. The desire to supply ETH is low, either because they want to or have already sold it into this 'pump' to $2100, or they no longer want to borrow against it.\n\nI'm not panicking but I'd be closing any leveraged wstETH/ETH loops because the longer we stay at full utilisation the more demand there will be from depositors to get out.

I&#39;m not saying Aave is failing, it isn&#39;t, but the last time I saw this was on Euler V1 when everyone max borrowed everything they could before the hacker could withdraw.</p>\n\n<p>What we&#39;re seeing here is different and there&#39;s two ways of reading it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The demand to borrow ETH is high, either because people are borrowing ETH to short it or they want to get all ETH off the market in a hurry.</li>\n<li>The desire to supply ETH is low, either because they want to or have already sold it into this &#39;pump&#39; to $2100, or they no longer want to borrow against it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not panicking but I&#39;d be closing any leveraged wstETH/ETH loops because the longer we stay at full utilisation the more demand there will be from depositors to get out. Basically if you&#39;re supplying ETH on Aave at size you&#39;re now trapped in that market until fresh supply enters, that causes a bit of unrest and a queue for ETH to leave quickly as it arrives.</p>\n\n<p>It might be a while before the rates come down and Aave DAO/Chaos is in a tough position of either waiting for more supply at these relatively low rates (in terms of current utilization) or to instead <em>increase</em> rates to encourage more supply at the risk of borrower pain.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote about this behaviour 12d ago here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1quk1p6/comment/o3bwe66/?context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1quk1p6/comment/o3bwe66/?context=3</a></p>\n\n<p><em>edit: after a bit more research it is indeed a sale, Garrett Jin withdrawing from Aave to sell on Binance.
