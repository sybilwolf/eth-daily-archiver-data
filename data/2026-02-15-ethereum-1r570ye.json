Fragmented liquidity was always a problem, but I never said L2s weren\u2019t Ethereum because I knew that it was on the roadmap to re-unite the liquidity in the long run. Be that through either:\n\n- Creating seemless cross L2 interoperability/composability\n\nOr\n\n- Scaling the L1 and making a viable path to bring it all back to the L1 with space for specialised L2s offering unique features like privacy or commercial integrations.\n\nVitalik basically just announced that we are now opting for option number 2.\n\nWas this not always the plan?
