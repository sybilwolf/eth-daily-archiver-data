This includes:\n\n* Dissatisfied or opposition-minded Iranians motivated by money, ideology (anti-regime sentiment), personal grudges, or promises of protection/family support.\n* Examples from reports: An Iranian Mossad agent (interviewed on Israeli TV in 2026) described volunteering via the Mossad website, getting trained abroad (including visits to Israel), and carrying out internal attacks during the 2025 conflict.\n* ProPublica and other sources detail Mossad recruiting Iranian dissidents for sabotage, smuggling weapons/vehicles, destroying air defenses, and providing intel - trained remotely or abroad, then deployed locally.\n* Former Mossad officials and analysts describe building a \"foreign legion\" of non-Israeli agents (Iranians or neighbors) for ops like nuclear sabotage and strikes from within Iran.\n* During the 2025-2026 protests/uprisings, Iranian regime claims (and some arrests) targeted alleged Mossad-recruited \"agents\" or collaborators - often portrayed as locals manipulated/funded by Israel/US, with videos shown of recruitment processes.\n\n>Probably many police have been killed, if 10-40k civilians died just this year.

The exact wording (translated from Farsi) is along the lines of:</p>\n\n<p><em>Let\u2019s all come out to the streets. The time has come.</em><br/>\n<em>We are with you. Not just from afar and verbally.</em><br/>\n<strong><em>We are also with you in the field.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Multiple reliable reports from outlets like i24NEWS, The Jerusalem Post, Al Arabiya, and others reference this post from Mossad&#39;s official Persian-language account.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/i/web/status/2005649986504237381\">https://x.com/i/web/status/2005649986504237381</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, what israeli would willingly go into that mission, let alone maybe 100 to kill so many police?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mossad agents operating inside Iran are often not Israeli citizens - they&#39;re frequently local Iranians (or from neighboring countries) recruited as assets, collaborators, or operatives.</p>\n\n<p>Mossad has shifted strategy over the years to rely heavily on recruited locals rather than sending Israeli nationals deep into hostile territory, where the risk of capture or death is extremely high. This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dissatisfied or opposition-minded Iranians motivated by money, ideology (anti-regime sentiment), personal grudges, or promises of protection/family support.</li>\n<li>Examples from reports: An Iranian Mossad agent (interviewed on Israeli TV in 2026) described volunteering via the Mossad website, getting trained abroad (including visits to Israel), and carrying out internal attacks during the 2025 conflict.</li>\n<li>ProPublica and other sources detail Mossad recruiting Iranian dissidents for sabotage, smuggling weapons/vehicles, destroying air defenses, and providing intel - trained remotely or abroad, then deployed locally.</li>\n<li>Former Mossad officials and analysts describe building a &quot;foreign legion&quot; of non-Israeli agents (Iranians or neighbors) for ops like nuclear sabotage and strikes from within Iran.</li>\n<li>During the 2025-2026 protests/uprisings, Iranian regime claims (and some arrests) targeted alleged Mossad-recruited &quot;agents&quot; or collaborators - often portrayed as locals manipulated/funded by Israel/US, with videos shown of recruitment processes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Probably many police have been killed, if 10-40k civilians died just this year. Some maybe not deserving but some definitely. 300 police is nothing against the people killed.
