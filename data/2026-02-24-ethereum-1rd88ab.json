Hegota comes after the Glamsterdam upgrade, which probably comes this summer. That means Hegota might come by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. At the moment the core devs are deciding for the headliners for Hegota. Last week it was decided that Focil is the headliner on the consensus side. Focil is a great way to strengthen the censorship resistance of the Ethereum mainnet and one of the upgrades I have been looking forward to since the tornado cash sanctions in 2022. \n\nOn the execution layer side there were 4 proposals for headliners:\n\n- EIP-7807 SSZ execution blocks: Unifies the exchange format between concensus and execution layer, which should improve block transmission speeds.\n\n- EIP-8144 Frame transactions: Lays the groundwork for allowing different kind of signature schemes to be used by accounts. Useful when migrating towards post quantum secure signature schemes (in 10 years...), but can also be used for other wallet features.\n\n- EIP-8105 Universal enshrined Encrypted Mempool\n\n- LUCID encrypted mempool\n\nThe last two are the interesting ones to me. The basic premise is that until now, the public mempool has been public and everyone could see what was happening in it. This opened everything up for toxic MEV to extract value from it. That is one of the reason all the private mempools started appearing. If you transmit a transaction through your wallet this transaction nowadays mostly goes to a private entity. This entity then gives access to this transaction to a select few MEV searchers, which looks at your transaction and finds ways to extract value from it. Most of the time the searchers are not allowed to sandwich you, but they can still extract MEV from you, just the most toxic versions are prohibited. This is kind of a win-win for the user and the searcher. The problem is though that it entrenches certain actors in the Ethereum space and they can decide who has access to this order flow data. Private mempools also means that the Focil upgrade does not help these transaction. They can be censored in private mempools if the the entity handling them does not like them. You also might not want to transmit directly on the public mempool as you might get front run there. Not a good situation. The two encrypted mempool proposals improve the situation, as they allow transactions in the public mempool to be encrypted. No one knows what they are doing, if they do not get included fast enough, then the Focil mechanism can force include them. When they are included in a block the the transaction then gets decrypted. Each of the two encrypted mempool proposals handles the decryption a bit differently. When they are decrypted the transactions have to be included at the beginning of a block (I think) in a specific order and cannot be sandwiched anymore. Pretty neat. The EIP-8105 proposal has been live on gnosis chain for a long time now and seems to work. The LUCID proposal is a rather new one with some simplifications. The interesting development yesterday was that the proposers of EIP-8105 publicly stated that they withdraw their EIP-8105 proposal and now fully support the LUCID proposal. Pretty impressive move. \n\nFor me it looks like the encrypted mempool proposals are the ones with the most public backing and now that everyone rallies behind just one proposal it might go through. This means the Hegota upgrade could become a strong statement for censorship resistance. The decision for which execution side headliner get selected is happening this Thursday in the all core devs call (ACDE #231)\n\nI will add the sources in a comment to this one.\n\nUPDATE: For those interested a bit more, tomorrows Ready for Merge podcast by Christine Kim host two encrypted mempool devs. Not sure when exactly she will stream it but I guess the stream will appear on her youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@Ready4Merge/streams","body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>There are some interesting developments for the Hegota upgrade regarding encrypted mempools.

This isn\u2019t bear porn or AI doomer fan-fiction` and then provide a long doomer fan-fiction. I am not saying their doomer fan-fiction is not going to happen, but there are a lot of places where I would argue they at least massively overestimate how fast LLM models improve and overestimate how cheap and reliable they are to replace the massive number of workers they claim in their doom piece. They, in my opinion also overestimate how fast an economy can change to lead to the results they predict in their scenario. Again not saying they are wrong in the direction and the changes that we might experience, but not sure 2.5 years is an accurate timeline. And the timeline is why I would call this doomer fan-fiction which adds to the general bearish sentiment. And it is working, this article has been shared pretty widely. I generally agree that wealth will be concentrated in fewer hands if more and more people rely on centralized LLMs and agents to do work for them. It is obvious that some people are not that needed anymore as they were a few years ago and many others can now use their skills more efficiently by getting help from LLMs for the routine tasks. But still, it is in my experience, still difficult for many people to actually use LLMs in a efficiency increasing fashion in their daily work, but people are learning how to use them now outside of pure coding assignments. This will compress margins for companies for sure and lead to fundamental changes in how we work, but I would be surprised if it leads to a broken economy within 2.5 years because of compressed margins.\n\nI like that they are claiming that in their scenario locally run (on your cell phone) open source models will win, but this part is not that realistic yet, as at the moment most models are either to big to run on your phone or too dumb to be useful. And you do not want to run an agent using one of these models. There might be a breakthrough but their claim that useful distilled models can run on your phone in January 2027 seem very optimistic.

But simply said if people have less income they have to buy less expensive houses and overall house prices come down, so that tracks. \n\nOverall it is an interesting read. They do not add much to the general direction we might be heading in the worst case scenario, but they tell the story with a highly compressed timeline for internet points. I started skipping parts in the last third as I had the impression they are just repeating themselves without adding anything substantial. \n\nThere is also a longer article which makes a few counterpoints on twitter.

This isn\u2019t bear porn or AI doomer fan-fiction</code> and then provide a long doomer fan-fiction. I am not saying their doomer fan-fiction is not going to happen, but there are a lot of places where I would argue they at least massively overestimate how fast LLM models improve and overestimate how cheap and reliable they are to replace the massive number of workers they claim in their doom piece. They, in my opinion also overestimate how fast an economy can change to lead to the results they predict in their scenario. Again not saying they are wrong in the direction and the changes that we might experience, but not sure 2.5 years is an accurate timeline. And the timeline is why I would call this doomer fan-fiction which adds to the general bearish sentiment. And it is working, this article has been shared pretty widely. I generally agree that wealth will be concentrated in fewer hands if more and more people rely on centralized LLMs and agents to do work for them.

As AI dramatically lowers the cost of cognitive work across law, medicine, education, marketing and beyond, prices for services will fall sharply. This amounts to a broad increase in real incomes \u2014 an invisible dividend that will unlock demand for new goods, experiences and innovations we can scarcely imagine today: personalized learning at scale, breakthrough medical therapies, immersive entertainment and entirely new creative industries.\n\nFar from rendering humans obsolete, advanced AI systems are most powerful when they complement human strengths in creativity, strategic judgment, empathy and ethical reasoning. The integration of these tools will accelerate scientific discovery, expand entrepreneurship and help address pressing challenges from climate change to longevity. In an era of aging populations and labor shortages across developed economies, AI arrives not as a destroyer of jobs but as an essential engine of growth.\n\nTo be sure, the transition will not be seamless.
