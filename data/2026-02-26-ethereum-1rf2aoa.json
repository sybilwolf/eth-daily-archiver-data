Insider leaks suggest that Trump has not made a final decision yet. All the military build up \u2014 now including F-22s which are usually last to leave before a strike (4 days before Midnight Hammer) \u2014 is a major sunk cost and only a new Iran deal will get them out of the corner that the US have put themselves in (backing down for no reason would look terrible and a big hit to legitimacy).\n\nIran has offered reduced uranium enrichment but no deal to anything limiting their missiles and funding of proxies which the US also wants. In the last couple of days the US has really ramped up the WMD rhetoric (HeyI'veSeenThisOneBefore.gif) and leaks suggest some in the White House mentioned having Israel strike first and then the US joining when Iran counter attacks as a way to make it more palatable for the public.\n\nBasically, it seems unlikely that a deal will be made due to demands being too far apart. On the other hand, Trump and some in his cabinet are reportedly hesitant/realistic about how unlikely a strategic victory is without a prolonged conflict. Personally, I just can't see Trump taking an L after no deal or a really shitty deal. My money is (literally) on a US strike of some kind. The results of which, I have no idea. Whatever happens, I hope it is good for the Iranian people.\n\nTo keep things on topic, in the short term, this would not be good for ETH imo.

Insider leaks suggest that Trump has not made a final decision yet. All the military build up \u2014 now including F-22s which are usually last to leave before a strike (4 days before Midnight Hammer) \u2014 is a major sunk cost and only a new Iran deal will get them out of the corner that the US have put themselves in (backing down for no reason would look terrible and a big hit to legitimacy).</p>\n\n<p>Iran has offered reduced uranium enrichment but no deal to anything limiting their missiles and funding of proxies which the US also wants. In the last couple of days the US has really ramped up the WMD rhetoric (HeyI&#39;veSeenThisOneBefore.gif) and leaks suggest some in the White House mentioned having Israel strike first and then the US joining when Iran counter attacks as a way to make it more palatable for the public.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, it seems unlikely that a deal will be made due to demands being too far apart. On the other hand, Trump and some in his cabinet are reportedly hesitant/realistic about how unlikely a strategic victory is without a prolonged conflict. Personally, I just can&#39;t see Trump taking an L after no deal or a really shitty deal. My money is (literally) on a US strike of some kind. The results of which, I have no idea. Whatever happens, I hope it is good for the Iranian people.</p>\n\n<p>To keep things on topic, in the short term, this would not be good for ETH imo.
